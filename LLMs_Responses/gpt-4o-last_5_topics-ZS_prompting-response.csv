t6PP67AsJaI,"Fetal surgery for spina bifida is an incredibly complex procedure. At Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the surgery was developed, a team of more than 20 people are in the operating room. They include up to four fetal surgeons, one neurosurgeon, two anesthesiologists, a maternal fetal medicine specialist, a fetal cardiologist and specialized nurses. They have performed this procedure more than any team in the world. Before surgery, the mother receives deep general anesthesia. Fetal surgeons make an incision across the mother's abdomen. The maternal fetal medicine specialist uses ultrasound to determine the position of the fetus and the margins of the placenta. The uterus is then opened with a specially designed uterine stapling device that controls bleeding, and the fetus is positioned so the spinal defect is visible. The fetal cardiologist monitors the baby's heart as the team closes the defect. The neurosurgeon removes a sac on the baby's back that covers the opening in the spinal cord. The sac is a thin membrane filled with fluid. The neurosurgeon and the fetal surgeon then close the defect in multiple layers using a lacing technique. First the muscle layers are closed over the defect. Then the skin is closed over the muscle layers. This ensures a watertight closure. The mother's uterus is closed in multiple layers, then her abdomen is closed and she is returned to her room. The pregnancy then continues until planned delivery at 37 weeks' gestation, most often in our Special Delivery Unit created for moms carrying babies with birth defects. ♪♪",Spina Bifida,4,5,5,1,4,5,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,2,"Score: 4

TuLAGDTpR6Y,"My name is Robin Bowman. I'm the director of Lurie Children's Multidisciplinary Spina Bifida Center and a fetal neurosurgeon with the Chicago Institute for Fetal Health, one of the few comprehensive fetal Care centers in the country. Approximately 1,500 babies are born each year in the United States with open spina bifida. In many cases, our experienced team can repair this birth defect while the baby is in the womb. This video demonstrates our minimally invasive fetoscopic repair for open spina bifida. This technique is designed to reduce the risk for mother and baby undergoing fetal surgery while preserving the option of vaginal delivery. Babies with open spina bifida who underwent back closure before birth have been shown to have long-term and improvement in their leg function, less of a need for hydrocephalus treatment, and improvement in the imaging of their brain. Open spina bifida occurs when the bones of a baby's back do not close properly. The baby's spinal cord extends through the open bones and attaches to the skin. This birth defect most often occurs in the baby's lower back region. Open spina bifida also has an impact on the developing brain. Babies with open spina bifida may develop an excess of spinal fluid known as hydrocephalus. The back part of their brain may also sink down into the neck. And this is known as hindbrain herniation. Fetal closure of the exposed spinal cord has been shown to help improve the hindbrain herniation and decrease the development of excessive brain water. The repair of an open spina bifida is done before 26 weeks gestation. Let's walk through this procedure. Once the mother is prepared for surgery and under anesthesia, we create an incision on her abdomen. A transverse or horizontal incision is made across the lower abdomen. In some cases a midline incision is made. The abdominal muscles are then opened in the midline. The abdominal cavity is entered. And the uterus is exposed. Intraoperative ultrasound is used to precisely identify the position of the baby in the placenta, which helps us plan our entry points while watching with the ultrasound. The initial port is inserted into the uterus. Warm, humidified carbon dioxide is then infused into the uterine cavity to expand our working field. We then insert a camera through the port and watch on the viewing screen as two additional 3 millimeter ports are inserted into the uterus. After all, three ports are inserted, the fetus is anesthetized and the back closure begins. We begin by releasing the spinal cord from the surrounding tissues. This allows the cord to relax back within the canal. We then close the spinal cord with a few stitches. Our attention is then turned to the dura or the tough membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, which holds in the spinal fluid. The dura is freed circumferential and closed in a watertight fashion. Lastly, the skin is undermined, enclosed in the midline. Occasionally, the defect is too large to allow primary skin closure. In this situation, a patch is used to close the skin opening. The fetal repair portion of the procedure is now complete. To further protect the baby for the duration of pregnancy, warm fluid and antibiotics are placed within the uterine cavity. All ports are removed, and the incisions are sutured closed. The mother's abdominal wall and skin are closed. The fetus continues to develop and heal for the duration of the pregnancy. During this time, the hindbrain herniation may also correct itself as the cerebellum will likely move back into place. Ideally, the pregnancy continues to full-term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally and cared for by our expert team of specialists. The Chicago Institute for Fetal Health and Lurie Children's Hospital is home to one of the oldest and largest multidisciplinary spina bifida centers in the world. This spina bifida team is comprised of a variety of surgical, medical, and rehabilitation experts, who are focused on assisting each child with open spina bifida reach and maintain their highest developmental potential.

4xOGmPla7e0,"... Hi, my name is Jason Hsu, and I am an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Keck School of Medicine here at USC. I'm also a pediatric neurosurgeon that works at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and I'm excited to talk to you a little bit about some of our ongoing work and our experience with fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. So myelomeningocele is a central nervous system malformation that occurs extremely early in life, and it results from a failure of primary neuralation where the caudal neural port fails to go from a sheet and roll over it to form a tube. The resultant malformation not only affects the spinal cord, but also the nerves, the bones, the muscles, and the skin in the back. There are also secondary effects that can occur in the brain as a result of this malformation lower down in the spinal cord. And in this picture, we can see our myelomeningocele in this newborn baby, but what's not immediately obvious in this picture is the other malformations that can occur within the brain, weakness in the legs or paralysis in the legs, bladder dysfunction, scoliosis, as well as symptomatic hydrocephalus. The traditional way that a myelomeningocele is treated is to repair it after the babies are born. However, a lot of work done in the 90s had looked for ways to repair the myelomeningocele lesion prenatally. And the researchers had shown that prenatal repair was effective in protecting the existing neural elements from continued injury in utero, as well as preventing spinal fluid leak from the myelomeningocele itself with a secondary effect of restoration of more normal CSF hydrodynamics. All of this work had resulted in a large randomized control trial that was published approximately 10 years ago. This trial is called the Management of Myelomeningocele, or MOMS trial, and the investigators had found improvements in rates of symptomatic hydrocephalus that required treatment, as well as improved motor outcomes in a number of the patients that were repaired prenatally. The benefits to the infants, however, did not come without risks. And there was noted to be very significant maternal morbidity related to prenatal repair, including severe complications such as placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, resulting in prematurity within many of the babies born, as well as a need for a C-section for the current pregnancy, as well as any future pregnancies. This is a picture of how the MOMS trial investigators had completed the prenatal repair. And what some of the maternal morbidity came about from was not only was a laparotomy required, but a hysterotomy was also required where the uterus is open in order to gain access to the myelomeningocele lesion. Despite the maternal risks, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has gained traction worldwide. Several centers within the United States have started fetal programs for myelomeningocele. In addition, several of these programs have attempted to refine the procedure so that there's less maternal risk and less trauma to the uterus. This is a technique that's described by Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Another technique had involved a hybrid approach where the uterus was externalized, however, the procedure was completed in a minimally invasive fashion where laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments were placed within the uterus in order to complete the myelomeningocele closure. Additionally, other groups, mainly actually in Europe as well as South America, have attempted to complete the myelomeningocele repair through a purely percutaneous approach involving the placement of the laparoscopes and working channels and laparoscopic instruments in a minimally invasive fashion through the skin. While this minimally invasive approach has mainly been done outside of the United States, here at USC we've collaborated with a group in Miami to try and bring this technique here. To date, USC and CHLA is currently only one of two centers in the United States to offer this percutaneous, fetoscopic repair for myelomeningocele. We are currently conducting a phase one study to evaluate its safety, and our goal is to try and achieve similar outcomes for our infants as the MOMS trial while improving maternal outcomes. This is a picture of our team, and as you can see, it's a very multidisciplinary team that not only involves fetal surgeons, OBGYNs, neurosurgeons, but also spina bifida, pediatricians, radiology as well as neonatologists. As you can see, it really takes a village to try and complete this work. We've done our first case in February of 2019, and as of October 2020, we've done 28 cases of 27 patients split between here and our collaborators over in Miami. This is a video of one of our cases, and here we have introduced our laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments. You can see the neuroplakode from before, and using laparoscopic scissors, we're able to carefully dissect out the neuroplakode and preserve any neural elements. After separating out the neuroplakode and the malformed spine from some of the surrounding tissue, you can see it pops down into a more normal position within the spinal cord. And once that's complete, we proceed with closure, and we try to do a multilayer closure to provide as much coverage and protection to the spinal cord as possible. So here, what we're doing is we're elevating and raising some of the muscles beside the spine to provide an extra barrier called the myofascial flap. This is a piece of dura repair, which we're using to reconstruct the fecal sac, and the myofascial flap is closed over top of this. Here you can see the myofascial flap is completed with complete coverage of our monomaniacal lesion. And you can see this, the skin is closed with a running suture. Here are some of our early results. In comparison to the MOMS trial, thus far we've had very similar gestational ages at delivery. One thing that's immediately apparent is the lower rate for cesarean section, and the other 13 patients were actually delivered vaginally, which was something that was not seen in the MOMS trial. We're still calculating our maternal risks, but thus far they've been comparable to what was seen in the MOMS trial. In terms of our infant results, we've seen very similar results in the MOMS trial as well. Of course, more data analysis is needed. However, what we've experienced is that we have had pretty comparable rates for the need for hydrocephalus treatment, as well as those improvements in motor outcomes. So in summary, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has become an increasingly popular treatment modality worldwide. The results of the MOMS trial had demonstrated improved infant outcomes in terms of symptomatic hydrocephalus, as well as motor outcomes. However, this did come with risks to MOM. Currently, in the United States, USC is undergoing a phase one trial as a collaborative work that's assessing the safety and feasibility of fetoscopic surgery in the United States. And our early data thus far has been very encouraging. Thanks for watching. And this picture here is a picture of our first patient. And that patient is doing extremely well. They have not required treatment for hydrocephalus and are able to ambulate independently.

Families may come to us, undergo the diagnostic testing, and the defect may not be a defect that is included in the criteria for the surgery. Even if a family is an ideal surgery candidate, this may not be the best thing for them. And it is our obligation to help them understand that that's alright, that that's okay, that that's their choice, that that is the right choice for them. For families that want the traditional approach of having surgery after birth but still want to deliver at our center because of our multidisciplinary experience and care, we follow them as well. We generally have them come back at monthly intervals so we can monitor growth and development of the baby to look for progression in the hydrocephaly and all the markers of complications. We generally deliver them at around 37 weeks. The mother usually has a cesarean section in the special delivery unit. Our goal is to deliver the baby without any additional trauma to the myelomeningocele sac and also not to rupture the sac but to deliver the myelomeningocele intact. The baby then is evaluated by a neonatal resuscitation team. We have special equipment ready so that we can do different positions knowing that that spinal cord is still exposed. The baby then goes to the NICU where all the multiple subspecialties come and evaluate the baby. Neurosurgery generally take the baby to the operating room within the first 24 to 48 hours of life and do the neurosurgical repair. The technical aspects are pretty much the same whether I do it prenatally or postnatally. I have the same layers, I do essentially the same operation.

I think that I was pretty comfortable and knew what to expect and we had met with everyone enough that I knew what the procedure was going to be and knew how it was going to go. I knew that they were going to stay in touch with Kevin. Remember they came in and they were ready to take me and they asked, do you want to walk in or do you want to go in a wheelchair? And I was like, I can still walk in. I want to walk in. Like, let's do this. I remember you walking away down that hallway. This isn't a neurosurgery program. This isn't an MFM program. This is a fetal care program. So the fetal care program is a multidisciplinary group that includes all the specialists that would interact with mom's care. To have a program where you can offer complex fetal surgery, it requires the presence and the infrastructure of a strong overall collaborative program. The objective of surgery is to close the myelomeningocele with as little or no scar tissue as possible and to recreate the layers that should have normally formed. And so it's to close the placode or the neural tissue into a tube and to close the dura or the covering of the spinal cord as it should have normally formed. Ideally to pull in fascia or connective tissue as it normally would be there and then to have the skin covering so that they don't need to be treated for hydrocephalus. And then Dr. Goodnight came out after the procedure was done and gave us an update and said everything went well and you were up resting in the recovery room and that we'd be able to come and see you. You know, overall you were, you were a trooper. We were well cared for. We had a good team. Even to this day when I tell people about Jack's diagnosis and what that means, it's not until you meet him that you can see beyond the diagnosis. Hi buddy. Okay, are you ready? Yeah. Hi buddy. I've been fortunate enough to do this long enough now that I've watched people graduate from high school, get married, have families, have jobs. I joke with them when they come to my clinic that I'm going to schedule extra visits so that they can just come see me and visit me in clinic because I love hearing how they're doing and how they're developing and you know how they're doing in school and things forward. He gives you the sweetest looks and the biggest smiles all the time and he's just, he's a really good boy and he's very resilient. He's really the opposite of the picture that was painted for us when we got his diagnosis in December. Every doctor we met with in the UNC fetal surgery team, they were so patient and they just took the time to make sure that we were very comfortable. Their optimism and hope really gave us optimism and hope.",Spina Bifida,3,3,5,1,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,2,3,2,4,"Score: 3 (partially)

hwKXYIiUUmo,"I was going in for my ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby and they had found out one of my tests that came out positive, my blood test. So they sent me to a specialist, a terrible in general, to see exactly what was going on and then she found out the defect. So then they sent me here to find out more exactly about the defect. As part of prenatal testing you do what's called a quad screen and the quad screen actually will look to see if your baby is at risk for having a hole in the spine and it just so happens that her quad screen back is positive and it said, hey look closer at this baby's spine, there may be something going on with it. She just let us know that was a spinal defect and you know what can cause it and what we would be dealing with and then she told me that we would have to come here to really figure out you know exactly where it was and exactly what our outlook was. Spina bifida is a failure of the closure of the back, particularly of both the spine and the spinal cord to properly form in the first month after the baby is being developed. And when that happens it leads to a defect in the back and the spinal elements that actually stick out of the back often in a sac that can be nonfunctional and that can lead to problems with movement of the limbs below that level of impairment that can involve sensation impairment below the level. Use of the bowel or the bladder properly is difficult due to those and there's also an association with hydrocephalus or fluid in the brain that accumulates due to that abnormality. Back in 1997 was the first procedure where they actually were, where someone took the chance of saying let's open up the uterus, let's close this defect and let's see if we can't keep these outcomes from happening or can we make better outcomes. Between 1997 and 2003 there was about 200 of these cases done across the nation and people were saying hey we're getting better outcomes with these babies than we are if we left them alone. And there was a lot of debate about well is it really worth the risk to the maternal health, is it really worth the risk to the fetal health, this is a dangerous thing to do, some of the medicines you're doing are very dangerous for the pregnancy, is this really the right thing to do? And so what happened was back in 2003 the NIH supported a study what they called the MOMS trial. All the pediatric surgeons got together and said we are not going to offer this until we kind of get an idea if this makes a difference or not. And so that was actually published in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine and that's the study that really kind of got us fired up here is because it actually showed that there are better outcomes. We're able to make these babies do better with this in utero procedure and so me and Dr. Bui had got together and said listen this is something that we need to offer in the region. I think we have enough volume of these babies that we see in my clinic to make this technique that we can offer here at Oster. So we're able to actually have a window up in the uterus and then be able to bring just the babies back through. So once we're able to get to the defect then the night takeover and under high magnification we actually do the repair. The good thing about Oster is that we have pediatric neurosurgeons, we have a pediatric cardiologist, we have a high risk pregnancy doctor, we have high risk anesthesia. We've got everything that we need here. The team was well prepared and that gave me a lot of confidence that we would be able to pull it off without any problem. We've been fortunate so far none of those children as of yet have required a shunt to be placed for hydrocephalus. They're doing very well with their growth. They do still continue to have some bowel and bladder problems but they're very manageable and they have had less overall orthopedic and neurologic impairment because of the surgery than they likely would have otherwise had. I think it's definitely a landmark procedure for Oster but it's also a landmark procedure for the state. I think this is a first in the state if not the region. Currently there are less than 10 programs in the country and that's because it does require quite a bit of expertise. I think that this really does highlight what Oster does well which is to bring together a lot of high end specialists into one area. His name is Kobe Damian Boudreau. He weighed four pounds and twelve ounces when he was born and that's 17 inches and a half long. Pretty much after the surgery his outcome is pretty much good. He's moving his legs like he should and his ultrasound of his brain came out fine and his incision looks good. He's doing pretty good. So this doesn't look very dissimilar from just a normal baby without spina bifida at this point. That's good. Okay so I think that you know the at least right now I don't have any real concern for a shunt and as far as the back and whether there's any leakage or breakdown of the wound the back looks about as good as we can hope for. I think that's you know because the baby had all that time of year within the belly. You had the absolute best result that we could have a whole family. Very, very happy about it. Yeah so well we'd get them. Oster has always been on the forefront in a number of areas of trying to do things that are game changers, really make a difference for the patient and this is one of those instances where you really are making a difference for the patient and over the years there have been some of those in adults and some of those in children and this is one that is really going to be a great advance for children. Now that he's here and we've gone through everything I'm very, very happy that we went ahead and did it because his outcome does look a lot better than what it would have been if we didn't do the surgery so I'm very happy about that.

dSjzCM4-6Y0,"Fetal surgery is about trying to save the lives or improve the lives of children by doing something before birth. It sounds like a crazy idea, operating inside the womb, but it's actually 30-years-old now and we've been doing it a long time. Spina bifida is a birth defect where the spinal cord and the spine don't form normally before birth. It fails to close. And because of that, that spinal cord is exposed to the elements in utero and then in theory, after birth. In the old days, we just took care of that problem after birth and protected the spinal cord, closed up the skin so that children would not get infected. They wouldn't get meningitis, an infection in the spinal cord, but we never had the expectation that it would improve their paralysis. We just assumed that paralysis was part of the problem of spina bifida. But we started to learn through the advent of ultrasound and by doing some studies in mice and things like that, that it appeared that the spinal cord, even though it was exposed was normal when it was formed. And it just seemed to lose function during gestation, that it was the trauma in utero. The exposure to amniotic fluid, just bumping up against the uterine wall that actually damaged the spinal cord. So, gosh, almost 20 years ago now, we asked the question, if we operated before birth, could that make the outcomes better? That's a study that was called the MOMS Trial. And interestingly, that was just finishing at the time I came to UC Davis. And what we discovered was that if you operated before birth, if you did fetal surgery, that in fact, those children did have a better outcome. I mean, this was miraculous. For the first time, the babies had some improvement in the ability to move their legs and it appeared that the spinal cord was somewhat improved. And I thought, ""If we can get some improvement, maybe we can get more improvement."" We looked at different kinds of cells. iPS cells were popular at the time, but we finally settled on mesenchymal stem cells from the placenta. We collaborated with Jan Nolta's group in the Institute for Regenerative Cures here at UC Davis, got advice and assistance from her. And then we took these special cells from the placenta, cultured them in a unique way that allowed these cells to secrete what I like to call ""magic stem cell juice."" We don't know exactly how it works, but we certainly know that it secretes lots of important growth factors for the spinal cord. We used a patch that is already approved by the FDA to repair problems either in the spinal cord or the brain when they need an extra layer to sort of close up what we call the dura, the lining of the central nervous system of the brain and the spinal cord. And we thought, ""Well, let's see if our cells can grow on this already FDA approved ""dural patch."" And not only did they grow, they seem to love it, but it's the same repair that was done for the big national trial. But this time we'll use a repair that includes this patch with cells on it. The reason it's important to do it almost exactly the same way it was done before is so that we can compare the results in a similarly rigorous fashion. So that we know it's really the cells that are making a difference.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,4,1,3,3,3,2,"Score: 5

Dr. Heather Jovanola, MD What the doctors at UCSF made sure we knew was that this was a huge risk to me as a mother. So the baby has to have the surgery at some point to close up his back, but he doesn't have to have it right now. On the other hand, UCSF is very good at this. We pioneered prenatal surgery. So that was very comforting going in, even though we knew this is a big deal. It was a long day. And finally the doctor came walking out, big smile, said, your son has a really cute butt. And so we kind of knew everything was okay when he was joking around. It was a big relief. I think for mothers who have a fetus diagnosis of spina bifida, I think it becomes an extremely important consideration and a very compelling case to be made to consider a fetal surgery very seriously. Another thing he'll do, and we love to have him do it, is when he comes grocery shopping with me, he wants to walk around and see all the things that are right at his eye level. He wants to grab things off the shelf and put them in the cart. So we let him do that. And he can handle walking for an hour and a half in the grocery store because it's so much fun for him to have the freedom to move around and see whatever he wants to see. And that really makes us feel good that the choices we've made and him being able to have the surgery have on some level allowed him to be that mobile instead of in a wheelchair.",Spina Bifida,4,4,5,1,2,2,1,3,2,3,3,2,4,3,4,"**Score: 4**

Yh47aMX-_9M,"So myelomeningocele is the most common form of spina bifida and it results from lack of closure of the primitive spinal cord which is the neural tube in the fetus at the bottom end and so the spinal cord and nerve roots and covering layers of the spinal cord are fused to the skin and muscle and it leaks spinal fluid out and leads to other complications over time including a Chiari malformation and subsequent hydrocephalus or the build-up of spinal fluid in the head and patients who undergo postnatal closure have an approximate 80% risk of hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventricular peritoneal shunt which is an implanted device. Unfortunately shunts are associated with a lot of morbidity and complications during childhood and life for children with spina bifida and myelomeningocele. So why do we do this in utero? For generations this repair has been done postnatally but as pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons what we found is that over time the dye is already cast by the time the baby is born. Obstetricians have noticed for several years now that they've been able to see many of these fetuses moving their legs in utero but by the time they're born they're no longer able to move their legs and they're paralyzed. So it was thought really that there's some ongoing injury that occurs during the pregnancy. The goal of doing this operation early before birth is to try to improve the function of the baby, to improve their leg strength and perhaps their bowel and bladder function and also importantly to minimize their risk of developing hydrocephalus that conditioned fluid on the brain. And when they do develop hydrocephalus and they need a shunt those shunts unfortunately don't work perfectly and they lead to all kinds of complications and it turns out that by doing this operation before birth it seems to cut that shunt rate in half and so we're very optimistic that we can have that same result for this infant. The patient is Naomi, she's 23 years old and this is essentially her first pregnancy to this point and the baby is around 25 weeks gestation, remembering of course that a normal pregnancy gestation is around 40 weeks so we're just a little tiny bit over halfway in the pregnancy. The baby has an open spinal defect called a spina bifida and the object of the surgery today is to close that lesion for a number of reasons. The leakage of the fluid out of this open lesion does two things at least that we know of. One is to expose the nerves to the amniotic fluid and two is to allow the leaking of fluid such that the cerebellum at the base of the brain can undergo pressure, this is called a Chiari 2 malformation and that kind of pressure on the intracranial structures can result both in issues with the cerebellum and with the ventricles of the brain so the baby's ventricles can become dilated. So by closing this lesion we're hoping to prevent ongoing injury and hopefully preserve neurologic function and in even some cases we believe it's possible to regain some neurologic function. It's a rather tricky operation that we did today. It's open fetal surgery so the mother is asleep under a very deep anesthetic. We have to then perform a C-section type incision on the mother to open up her tummy and to expose the uterus and then we have to open the uterus. This is the pregnant uterus that's filled with amniotic fluid so we have to open that up and the amniotic fluid will come out and then we expose this spina bifida deformity in the fetus and then the neurosurgeons Dr. Bolo and Jay today came in and did that repair of that spina bifida defect and then very importantly we then have to close that uterus up with stitches and keep it pregnant and keep the baby inside the uterus and we have to have it so it doesn't leak that amniotic fluid and that the pregnancy can continue and that's where this becomes pretty tricky and pretty difficult. Well so far the operation went perfectly today. We were able to open the uterus very nicely, expose the deformity in the fetus, the spina bifida repair seemed to go very smoothly and we were able to get that uterus closed up very nicely and so far mom and baby are recovering very well. I don't see any signs of labor. The uterus seems to be snugly closed and the mother is now recovering from the anesthesia and she's doing very well. It was really a multidisciplinary total force with all the different disciplines present everybody worked well seamlessly perfectly, it was a well choreographed perfectly executed surgical procedure.

aW_mLBlZES8,"Everything was going well with the ultrasounds and the checkups and on our 18th week they said we wouldn't hear from them unless there was an issue. The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless.

In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible.

And honestly, I fully expected him to say, oh, it's okay, everything's fine, you know, nothing to worry about. But he didn't. He said, yeah, we're looking at a case of spina bifida. It's a pretty severe case. Worst case scenario, they can't walk, you know, that they have trouble going to the bathroom and all of that. And I was just like, what do I do? So the doctor then took a plane to us. He said, well, there's a surgery that they can do while they're in utero, you know, and they can repair that. In utero surgery to close up spina bifida is basically to close up the defect of the baby's back to keep further damage from occurring that could occur if the closure happens after the baby's born. Something inside me said, you need a second opinion. I hadn't given up that faith. Fetal surgery is the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. It leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability. The day that Dr. Cass told us that they would be willing to do the surgery, Kimmy was 25 weeks pregnant and three days.

All the components of our rather large team meet to discuss the case and then have the parents come in and we go through the entire process once again so that there's a clear understanding of what's involved and give them the opportunity to ask any additional questions. We had to be down here, I don't know if it was five o'clock or six o'clock, but it was very early in the morning. I was so nervous. And you know, still a lot of consultations and things like that going on and you know. Flurry of activity. They put an epidural in was the first thing they were going to do and I had to be awake for that. You are knocked out for the surgery. I remember bending over getting that epidural and they're talking to me and all of a sudden you go, oh, I mean if it hadn't hit us already, it hit me then. This is big time. Seventeen days before that, life was normal and all of a sudden here we are. We're doing fetal surgery for something that's cutting edge. We have a special OR that we use for fetal surgery. It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue. Once the uterine wound is closed, the maternal abdomen is closed, including the skin with a plastic surgical closure. All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed.",Spina Bifida,4,4,5,1,5,4,1,3,5,2,1,1,2,1,3,"Score: 4

Wn2wqi7QbsY,"(bouncy music) - Hi, I'm Karin Muraszko. I'm the Chair of Neurosurgery here at the University of Michigan and what I'd like to talk to you about today is what happens after the baby is born. A child with spina bifida will have life-long issues that will need to be addresses and followed up with doctors in a variety of subspecialties. In the first hours of life, a group of physicians including the neonatologist and neurosurgeons will assess a child in the intensive care unit. The neonatal intensive care unit is generally the place where such children are placed shortly after birth. It's that assessment which helps us decide when and how we're going to take care of the child in the first days of life. So after the baby is born, one of the most important things that we need to make certain of is what we do for all children, which is are there any problems in terms of breathing? Are there any problems in terms of infection? Is their heart working well? And after we get through all of that, the vast, vast majority of children will have no problems in that area, we then are particularly interested as to whether the baby will have the development of hydrocephalus. The repair of the myelomeningocele usually occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours and the decision about whether any kind of diversionary procedure for the cerebral spinal fluid to deal with the hydrocephalus is something which also will be made within the first day or two of life. But in many cases dealing with the hydrocephalus is something which needs to be followed over time and therefore may not be done at the same time as the repair of the myelomeningocele. After that there are other additional things that need to be looked at. The doctors from urology and orthopedic surgery will examine the baby to make certain that the bladder and the bowel functions are okay, that there are no specific problems with how the legs are working or the spine. And the neurosurgeon will be particularly important to look at whether the baby has any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention. If the baby has had a repair of the myelomeningocele in utero then the neurosurgeon will be primarily looking at that repair site to make certain that it's okay and not having any problems. If the baby did not have a repair in utero then that's something that will also be done in the first days of life. The timing of that will depend a little bit on each child. We need to make certain that the baby is safe for an anesthetic and we also need to make certain that we often use our plastic surgery colleagues to help us make certain that there's adequate skin closure in these children. Over the lifetime of a baby they'll be necessary follow-up with each of the specialists I talked about. The neurosurgeon to make certain that the neurologic function continues and that there's no problem. The orthopedic surgeon to make certain that the spine, particularly with respect to scoliosis, and the lower extremities, particularly with respect to how they're formed and how the walking is going. And the urologist because almost all children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, have problems with their bladder and bowel function that will require the urologist to follow them. Children with myelomeningocele require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Because the life expectancy of a child with myelomeningocele is really quite good and that we expect them to grow up to be adults and to have normal lives with respect to their disabilities, we also recognize that it's a lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care to achieve the best results for these children. Therefore it's a group of specialists who understand the complexity of myelomeningocele, who'll be taking care of the child, not only as an infant but as a young adult and onwards into full adulthood.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,1,4,5,1,3,2,2,1,2,3,3,2,"**Score: 5**

While it does highlight the expertise and the multidisciplinary approach of the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment at CHOP (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia), it fails to mention any specific timelines, dates, or periods related to the treatment or research. Statements such as “For years we have continued to focus” and “having patients steadily doing this” are vague and lack any concrete temporal references. 

Adding specific dates or timeframes would significantly enhance the clarity regarding when the information or advancements being discussed were actually made. For example, mentioning when certain treatments became available, or citing particular studies and their publication dates, would help in establishing the relevancy and currency of the data.

The video transcript is informative and highlights the dedication and expertise of the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment at CHOP (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). However, it lacks balance and demonstrates a significant bias towards promoting CHOP as a superior healthcare provider for fetal conditions, particularly spina bifida. 

The positive aspects of CHOP's services and multidisciplinary approach are emphasized repeatedly, with terms such as ""finely oiled machine,"" ""irreplaceable experience,"" and ""critical to the success."" While these points may be valid, the transcript does not present any potential drawbacks, limitations, or considerations of seeking treatment elsewhere. 

Furthermore, the personal story of Sean, a patient, is used to exemplify the success and positive outcomes associated with CHOP's care, which again skews the narrative towards an idealized depiction without offering a comparison to other institutions or alternative perspectives.

They are scheduled for an entire day of diagnostic testing and counseling. The diagnostic process involves radiologic studies, maternal fetal ultrasound that's usually two plus hours in duration in which we look at everything. How big the lesion is, what segments of the spine are involved. They look for the degree of hydrocephaly, evidence for the Chiari malformation, and we look for evidence of paralysis or function of the lower extremities. A fetal MRI that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes and requires the mother to be still inside the MRI chamber. A fetal echocardiogram to look at the fetal heart. Fetuses with myelomeningocele typically do not have any problems that are wrong with the fetal heart. However, as a fetal cardiologist, it's very important to make sure that we're not dealing with any abnormalities whatsoever of the heart, even if they're mild. Part of the evaluation when a family comes to our center is not only the detailed imaging of the fetus, but a careful evaluation of the mother herself. And then we meet with the family to go through the results of those tests and tell them what we know about the diagnosis. The counseling involves a multidisciplinary group. An experienced nurse, neurosurgeon, fetal surgeon, maternal fetal medicine specialist, social worker.

gwSUxO8ahIU,"Our journey began back, I guess, in 2013. We found out we were pregnant with twins, so I was high risk. So we went to a specialist to have an ultrasound and one of the twins had passed and then I can remember the doctor just doing the ultrasound over Emerson to make sure everything looked good. He was taking a bit longer than I had expected, so I finally asked him, I said, is everything okay? And he said, you know, I'm looking at her head and he said, I'm seeing some signs that are indicative of spina bifida. And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her? And he said, it means that she will probably never walk. It's a birth defect where the back is open. She will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life. It was heart-wrenching at that time. It was a bad day, especially for my wife. You know, when you lose a child due to miscarriage and then get this diagnosis. So I immediately started researching that when we got home and that's when we found out about the fetal center here at Texas Children's. We were able to come in and do the qualification process, which is a two-day process. It was very, very intense, met with so many physicians, surgeons. It was a long day. When the patient is coming to us with a diagnosis of neuro tube defect, first we have a comprehensive evaluation of the fetus. The patient will have the fetal MRI ultrasound. The patient will have a meeting with our pediatric surgeons, with our pediatric neurosurgeons, and with the fetal intervention team. And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive.

The video narrates a personal journey of parents dealing with a spina bifida diagnosis in one of their twins and their experience with the Fetal Center at Texas Children's Hospital. While it delivers an emotionally compelling story and highlights the successful medical intervention and positive outcomes, it lacks balance in several areas. 

First, the video heavily focuses on the positive aspects of the medical intervention provided by Texas Children's Hospital, which creates a potentially biased view that may not be representative of all experiences with spina bifida treatments. With the narrative centering around a single optimistic case, it glosses over the diversity of possible outcomes and does not discuss any potential complications, risks, or long-term challenges that patients with spina bifida might face.

Throughout the transcript, terms like ""open fetal surgery"" and ""experimental technique"" are mentioned, but there is no elaboration on the potential risks or side effects that accompany these procedures. For example, open fetal surgery is a complex and invasive procedure that carries significant risks to both the mother and the fetus, including preterm labor, infection, and surgical complications. However, these are not discussed at all.

Explanation: The video transcript provided focuses primarily on the process and logistical details surrounding fetal surgery for spina bifida, rather than on the explicit benefits of the treatment. While the transcript does offer some insight into the outcomes of such surgeries — such as the increased likelihood of premature birth and the supportive infrastructure in place (e.g., special delivery units, cesarean sections, and neonatal intensive care) — it does not concretely outline the specific benefits of the surgery itself.

The mention of the baby being born healthy and the improved coordination among medical teams implies positive outcomes, but these points are shared in a rather implicit manner. Furthermore, no direct comparisons are made to alternative treatments, nor are the long-term benefits of the surgery discussed. Therefore, while there are implicit benefits mentioned (e.g., healthy birth at 36.5 weeks), the transcript lacks a comprehensive and clear explanation of the advantages conferred by the fetal surgery treatment.

The mention of cesarean sections due to uterine incisions hints at surgical and future pregnancy risks but lacks detailed discussion. The video transcript appears to emphasize the coordination of care, communication between healthcare providers, and the preparedness of the special delivery unit, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the risks involved in the treatment.

jlDZA2PNW2o,"The term “spina bifida” comes from the latin “split spine,” which is actually a pretty good description, because spina bifida is a birth defect where the tissue on the left and right side of the back that normally come over the spinal cord to protect it, don’t completely meet up to form a nice seal, leaving behind various degrees of an opening right down the middle of the lower back. Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called ‘open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum—the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus—an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one’s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, ‘occulta’ is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don’t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don’t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn’t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she’s even pregnant, and therefore she’s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida—myelomeningocele—is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother’s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus’s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother’s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can’t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

6Ii_v3t9hpU,"Spina bifida, or its most severe form, myelomeningocele, is the most common central nervous system or neurologic birth defect in the world. Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray. And what it is, is that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, that has a lot to do with control of motor movements, is wedged down into your neck. The cerebral spinal fluid that cushions the brain and cushions the spinal cord leaks out through the back through the open spina bifida defect. That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain. The water isn't on the brain, it's inside the brain. If you don't treat that, then you end up with a massively enlarged head, you die, or you end up with severe mental retardation. So in order to minimize that ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, the pediatric neurosurgeon places a shunt tube. It's a simple device. This is a shunt. It's made out of silicone. This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function. So it's a lifelong issue of disability.",Spina Bifida,4,4,5,1,3,4,1,4,3,1,5,5,5,2,2,"### Score: 4

bLnYzCcTEEA,"In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is usually done between 20 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. The womb is then open to expose the back of the fetus using a specially designed staple to control bleeding. The tissue over the defect is then opened and removed. Next, the spinal cord is free from surrounding tissue before it is protected using the Dura. We then close the muscle layers over the defect to further protect the spinal cord. The skin of the fetus is then closed over the defect. If a fetus does not have enough tissue on its back for primary closure, we will repair the spinal defect using patches as shown here. First, we protect the spinal cord by suturing a patch over it before we lay down a second patch to reinforce the repair. We then close the large skin defect using a piece of skin substitute to complete the repair. We then close the womb and conclude the surgery by closing the mother's incision.

asl-c1zmHmk,"(soft music) - Spina bifida is a fairly common birth defect that occurs in one to two out of every 1000 live births. What normally should occur early in fetal development or the development of your baby is the neural tube. Starts off as a flat plate of cells, and then around six weeks into development, that flat plate zips itself closes and forms the neural tube. Inside that tube, the nerves from our brain run down to our limbs, so to our arms and to our legs, and the neural tube forms a protective barrier so that those delicate nerves don't get damaged. In cases of spina bifida, also known as a neural tube defect, what happens is that zipping process doesn't go quite right and there can be a gap in the neural tube that allows those delicate nerves to come out of the body, usually out of the skin and they're damaged, as, in exposure to the amniotic fluid. When there is damage to those nerves when the babies are born, we do surgery to repair the opening, but the nerves have usually already suffered some damage. As a result, people or babies with spina bifida or children with spina bifida usually have some degree of paralysis or the inability to use their legs to some extent. So some people with spina bifida will undergo surgery and have a limp or need some sort of help with bracing. Other people with spina bifida will use a wheelchair, so there's some degree, but usually no matter when we are able to do surgery, there's some damage to those nerves. Spina bifida can happen in any pregnancy to any woman. We know there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida and those include moms who are diabetic, when there's been a family history of other individuals with a neural tube defect, or some women on certain medications. But most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk, and that's why we talk so much about folic acid. Folic acid is a B vitamin that we know helps reduce the incidence of spina bifida. Usually people get folic acid in their diet, but we recommend that any woman of any childbearing age take a vitamin that has 0.4 milligrams of folic acid. Because that neural tube closes so early in pregnancy, sometimes a neural tube defect has formed before a woman even knows she's pregnant. For women that we identify that are at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida, we'll typically recommend more folic acid so it's a good idea to talk to your OB if you're considering having a baby and think you have any risk factors that would increase the risk for this birth defect.",Spina Bifida,4,5,5,1,4,4,1,4,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,"Score: 4

We follow the child's head circumference and if the head grows inappropriately, which is a sign of fluid under pressure, then we make arrangements to place a ventricular perineal shunt, which is the treatment for hydrocephalus. People who have hydrocephalus, they don't absorb the fluid, although they continue to make it. Yeah, I'll take a couple more of those and then some derma bond. So you need to move it somewhere else. So the shunt is basically plumbing to move the fluid from the brain down to the abdomen where it's ultimately reabsorbed into the bloodstream, just like it would be in the normal situation in the head. It looks good. And then once she finally got to the point where she had stabilized, was eating well, we were actually able to get her home at that point. There's our beautiful baby.

0Gf6o2ZEQkc,"[Fetoscopic spina bifida repair animation] This animation shows a spina bifida repair, done prenatally, using a fetoscopic technique. In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back, with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is most commonly done between 22 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. We may use either a transverse incision, shown here . . . or a midline incision, as shown here. This animation shows a transverse incision. After we make the incision and cut through the layer of muscle, the womb is exposed. Ultrasound helps us to confirm the position of the fetus and shows us the best location to place the first port for the surgery. We then expand the amniotic cavity using humidified and heated carbon dioxide, which creates more space for us to do the repair. To enable us to see inside the womb, we insert a camera into the amniotic cavity through the first port. Two additional ports are then placed under direct vision to allow placement of instruments for the repair. We inject a cocktail of pain medication, paralytics and medication to protect the baby’s heartbeat into the gluteal muscle. We then place a stabilization stitch in the baby’s upper back, above the spina bifida. We first open up the sac all the way around the spina bifida defect. Once the sac is completely open, we free the placode, or exposed portion of the spinal cord, from the surrounding tissue. This procedure, which is called untethering, allows the placode to fall back down nicely into the spinal canal. We then raise the skin flap around the defect to loosen up the skin. This will eventually help us form a water tight closure of the spinal defect. To protect the placode, we place a patch into the defect. We anchor the patch on one end to the baby’s back using dissolvable sutures. A second patch is then placed to give additional protection, and again, it is secured with dissolvable sutures. We then close the skin over the spinal defect using dissolvable sutures, when the baby has enough skin to do so. If the defect is too large and we are not able to close the skin, we use a skin patch, forming a water tight closure. The stabilization stitch is removed. The repair is now complete. The ports are removed and the port sites are closed with dissolvable sutures. The amniotic fluid we removed is now replaced with warm fluid, and antibiotics are placed into the amniotic cavity. Finally, we close the mother’s abdominal wall muscle, and then close the skin.

A little boy from Algeria suffered terribly for more than two years until his community helped raise money to send him to Mayo Clinic. Unbearable. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He had to live with this pain all the time. This YouTube video is not easy to watch. Munim Fershishi was born in Algiers with a severe form of spina bifida. His spinal cord did not close and his nerves that control walking and other functions pushed out into a sac of fluid called a meningocele. He could not walk or even sit. His mother Salima says her son spent the first two years of his life tilted forward on his stomach. He was in pain and doctors didn't do anything. Then the sac on Munim's back broke. He developed meningitis and slipped into a coma. His eyes were closed and he was breathing through a tube. Doctors in Algiers operated on Munim, but it did not help. Then, thanks to donations from the community, Munim was transported to Mayo Clinic. Probably the only reason the child survived, truthfully, for two years was due to the tremendous, obvious love and energy of the mother and the family. Neurosurgeon Frederick Meyer teamed up with other specialists in plastic surgery and pediatrics to customize a treatment plan for Munim. First, they cleared his body of infections. Then, Dr. Meyer opened the skin covering on Munim's spine and put the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal. Then, he closed the spinal canal and plastic surgeons closed the skin. No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery. He can move his feet, he moves his legs, he can sit down, he can eat with his own hand. Salima says Munim is without pain. He can play and laugh for the first time. Physical therapists are helping Munim get stronger and walk better than expected. Doctors aren't sure how far Munim will go with physical therapy, whether or not he'll be able to walk unassisted. But now, there's a promise of a full, productive life. He's my life.

While it provides detailed information about his condition, the surgical procedure, and his subsequent recovery, it does not offer any details on additional sources of support or information for viewers who might be seeking further assistance or knowledge about spina bifida.

For an ideal score of 5, the video would need to include references to organizations, support groups, or additional educational resources where viewers could find more information or support. This might include mentioning websites, hotlines, community health programs, or specific foundations dedicated to helping individuals with spina bifida and their families.

The video instead focuses solely on the narrative of Munim’s journey and recovery without pointing viewers towards any external resources or communities for additional assistance or information. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of providing additional sources of support or information, resulting","Score: 5

Explanation: 

The video transcript explicitly discusses multiple areas of uncertainty surrounding Munim’s condition and treatment, which warrants a score of 5. Firstly, there is initial uncertainty about the long-term outcomes of Munim’s condition after surgery. Specifically, the transcript mentions, “No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery.” This indicates a significant area of medical uncertainty regarding the success of the procedures performed.

Secondly, there is discussion regarding Munim’s future physical capabilities despite the successful surgery: ""Doctors aren't sure how far Munim will go with physical therapy, whether or not he'll be able to walk unassisted."" This directly acknowledges the uncertain prognosis concerning his rehabilitation and long-term physical abilities. 

Lastly, the video also implicitly touches on the broader uncertainties and challenges associated with managing spina bifida, especially in resource-limited settings like Algiers, highlighting disparities in medical access and outcomes.

The transcript's focus on these uncertainties varies from immediate post-surgical outcomes","Score: 3 (Partially)

Explanation: 

The transcript partially describes how some aspects of the treatments work. It outlines the sequencing and decision-making of the medical treatments Munim received, mentioning several key actions taken by the medical professionals:

1. Cleared his body of infections.
2. Neurosurgeon opened the skin covering the spine and repositioned the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal.
3. Closed the spinal canal and the skin.

This provides a basic understanding of the surgical intervention involved in treating a severe form of spina bifida. However, the transcript lacks detailed explanations regarding the mechanisms and specific methodologies behind each treatment step. It doesn’t explain how clearing the infections aids the overall treatment plan or the technical complexity and biological reasoning behind repositioning the nerve roots and closing the canal.

While the video does give a structured overview of the treatment steps, it doesn’t delve deeply into the science or procedural specifics. Therefore, the information given is more geared toward a general audience and lacks the","Score: 2

Explanation:
The video transcript mainly narrates the harrowing story of a young boy named Munim suffering from a severe form of spina bifida and his subsequent journey to receive treatment at the Mayo Clinic. While it effectively conveys the emotional and physical challenges faced by Munim and his family, it does not adequately describe the benefits of the treatments in a systematic or detailed manner. 

The narrative touches on the sequence of medical interventions performed, such as clearing infections, repositioning nerve roots, and closing the spinal canal, but it does not delve deeply into the specific benefits of each procedure. For instance, while it is mentioned that Salima, Munim's mother, noted improvements like reduced pain, the ability to sit, and some motor functions, these are presented more as outcomes rather than outlined benefits of specific treatments. There is also no substantial explanation connecting how each part of the treatment directly led to those improvements.

The video transcript provided does not describe the specific risks associated with each treatment option for spina bifida. The transcript primarily focuses on the personal story of Munim, a child from Algeria suffering from a severe form of spina bifida, and the journey he and his family underwent to secure and receive treatment at the Mayo Clinic. 

It discusses the surgical procedures he underwent, such as clearing infections, repositioning the exposed nerve roots, and closing the spinal canal. However, the narrative does not delve into the potential complications or risks associated with these procedures. Additionally, while it describes the positive outcomes post-surgery, it does not balance this with any discussion of what might have gone wrong or the potential side effects and long-term implications of the treatments received.

The focus is more on the emotional and human aspects of his family's struggle and relief following successful surgery, rather than providing a medical analysis of treatment risks. Therefore, the transcript does not meet the criteria for informing viewers","Score: 4

Explanation: 
The video transcript does discuss the repercussions of not treating a severe form of spina bifida by illustrating the case of Munim. It describes in detail the suffering Munim endured due to the lack of initial proper medical treatment — including severe pain, inability to walk or sit, and the subsequent development of meningitis and coma after the meningocele sac broke. These details explicitly outline the severe consequences of not addressing the condition promptly and effectively. 

However, although it provides significant insights into the outcomes of delayed or inadequate treatment, there is a slight gap in discussing what might happen in the future if no treatment is given at all. The narrative emphasizes Munim's severe condition and the unsuccessful initial interventions, followed by a focus on the eventual successful treatment. While the suffering and critical repercussions of inadequate initial management are clear, a more specific discussion about the long-term prognosis without any treatment might have provided a more comprehensive answer.

These details illustrate a profound positive impact on his quality of life.

However, the transcript lacks a detailed or systematic discussion of how different treatment choices can affect various aspects of overall quality of life. While it points out the dramatic improvement in Munim's condition post-treatment, it does not delve deeply into potential long-term outcomes, other quality-of-life dimensions (like cognitive development, social integration, or emotional well-being), or how alternative treatments might present different impacts.

Explanation:
The video transcript provided does not clearly indicate that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. Rather, it focuses specifically on a single course of action taken for a child named Munim, including his initial lack of treatment, subsequent surgery in Algiers that did not help, and finally the treatment he received at Mayo Clinic. The narrative centers around the lack of initial medical intervention, the painful consequences, and then the eventual, successful multidisciplinary treatment plan at Mayo Clinic that involved infection clearance, spinal surgery, and physical therapy.

While the video does highlight the critical role of various specialists and the comprehensive care Munim received, it does not mention alternative treatments or suggest that there are multiple valid approaches to managing spina bifida. The emphasis is on the specific and successful intervention at Mayo Clinic, without providing a broader context of other potential treatment options that might be available or viable.

Explanation: 

The video transcript focuses primarily on a specific case of a child with spina bifida who received life-saving surgery at Mayo Clinic after community donations facilitated his travel from Algeria. While it highlights the critical role of the medical professionals and the community's support, it does not provide evidence of shared decision-making principles. Shared decision-making involves clinicians and patients working together to make decisions, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances.

In this transcript, there is no indication that Munim's mother or family were engaged in discussions about the various treatment options, risks, benefits, or potential outcomes. Instead, the focus is on the severity of Munim's condition, the inadequacies of local medical care, the critical intervention at Mayo Clinic, and the subsequent positive outcomes post-surgery.

For shared decision-making to be evident, the transcript would need to reflect conversations between the medical team and the family about treatment choices,",set()

And we've had two healthy pregnancies, no complications whatsoever. It was really shocking for us to find out that anything was wrong. I mean, not that I would, but I didn't feel an different being pregnant, I didn't have any suspicion whatsoever. Spina bifida is so different in the way that it affects each child, so even when you're researching, you have so many possible outcomes.  It was nice that we actually had genetic counseling at that time, but to a certain regard, you kinda feel like you're on an island by yourself at that point. And we were looking for someone to really help us become grounded and know where we were gonna be going in the future.  Doctor Baschat: It's a 4D probe phase.  Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity. And that is a major advantage for life.  The idea that I also got to have a vaginal delivery was really, really important to me. My recovery was pretty easy after she was born and that made a huge difference in my ability to be there for her and for my other kids.  Doctor Miller: Because we have such a small core team who's involved in the total care of these patients, any small change, we can observe immediately.  We have regular followup appointments with a lot of doctors, but that's okay. We see neurosurgery every three months, just to keep checking on things and making sure things are going well.  Scott: From her health and the baby's health, we couldn't have asked for anything better from that surgery.  Fetal surgery is hard. It's not an easy decision to make. The quality of life that we expect for Harper is the same quality of life we expect for our other kids.  Child: How many months are her?  Six months.  Six months old.

_FZntuo_W20,"Hello friends, I am Dr. Anurag Saxena, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon and Spine Surgeon at Naranath Superspecialty Hospital, Gurgaon. Today we are going to talk to you regarding Spina Bifida. Spina Bifida is a condition which refers to a developmental defect in the spinal column of the child which means that there are certain areas of the spine of the child, bony spine and neural spine which are not able to form during the development of the child as a fetus. This leads to a defect in the back, it is usually more common in the lower side of the back but this can happen at the other extremity that is in the cervical region or the back of the head also. And this defect leads to a swelling which is called as cystic swelling or meningosil, myosil and sometimes there can be fatty tissues in it and it is called as a lipoma. So broadly Spina Bifida can be divided into two categories, one is called as a Spina Bifida Occulta which means occult or hidden which means that the defect you cannot see from outside and there is a covering of a skin or a fatty tissue over the defect and the other category is called as Spina Bifida Apperta or where it is apparent or where you can see it when there is a defect which is visible or there is a big swelling of a fluid containing sac which is available. The fluid containing sac can be meningosil and myosil which we are going to describe further in this video. We need to know exactly how it happens is it happens because the spine closes like a zip of a cloth when the patient, when the baby is in the womb and during the development this zip like closure of the spinal cord or your spine is sometimes hampered at either end of the spine that is in the upper end or the lower end and this leads to a defect which remains and in this defect certain tissues goes in from like body fat and muscles can go in and sometimes the neural tissues which forms a tube are not able to form a tube and sometimes there can be absence or inactive neural tissues inside this kind of swelling which leads to spina bifida problems. What exactly causes this kind of problems is not known however there is a clear association with deficiency of a vitamin called as folic acid in mothers especially at the time of conception and during the first trimester of the pregnancy. Other causative agents include certain type of drugs and genetic factors also. So if there is a family history, if somebody in the family is suffering from this kind of disease then the chances of one having baby with spina bifida increases as compared to general population. So when the cystic swelling contains only the fluid or the CSF or the cerebrospinal fluid then it is called as a meningosy. When this cavity contains fluid and the neural tissues which can include the spinal cord or nerves then it is called as a meningomyelosy. Because it is a developmental defect then sometimes the babies can have associated developmental problem in the brain like building up of the fluid which is called as hydrocephalus and sometimes they can have problems in their lower feet like club foot. Very rarely these kind of babies can have developmental problem in other organs of the body like heart and gastrointestinal organs. So apart from the swelling in the back or anywhere in the back like from your cervical spine to lower spine, most of the time in the lower spine this swelling is apparent and these patients usually have weakness or less movement of the legs and their control of their urine and bowels is also hampered. Now there are series of diagnostic tests which can be applied before birth. They are called as antinatal diagnostic tests and then there are after the baby is born then there are certain diagnostic modalities like MRI and the treatment largely depends on the type of the spinal bifida. The diagnosis and the treatment will be covered in the next part of this video. Thank you.",Spina Bifida,5,4,5,1,4,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,"**Score: 5**

**Explanation:**

The video transcript does refer to areas of uncertainty, particularly in its discussion of the causes of Spina Bifida. Dr. Anurag Saxena explicitly states, ""What exactly causes this kind of problems is not known,"" indicating that there is some ambiguity surrounding the etiology of this condition. He does, however, mention a known association with folic acid deficiency and possible links to certain drugs and genetic factors, signifying that while some contributing factors are identified, the exact cause remains uncertain.

Additionally, by mentioning that Spina Bifida can have associated developmental problems in the brain and rarely in other organs, the video subtly hints at the unpredictable nature of the condition's manifestations. The inclusion of diagnostic tests implies that despite uncertainties, there are established methods to identify and categorize the condition further.

Although the speaker, Dr. Anurag Saxena, provides an in-depth explanation of Spina Bifida, its types (Spina Bifida Occulta and Spina Bifida Aperta), and associated symptoms and complications, the discussion remains strictly focused on the condition itself. There is an explanation of its development, causes (such as folic acid deficiency and genetic factors), and associated diagnostic tests. However, there is no mention of specific treatments or their benefits.

For a score of 3, the transcript would need to at least partially describe some treatments and general benefits. For a score of 5, a detailed discussion of different treatment options along with their specific benefits and potential outcomes would be expected.

The video stops short of discussing treatment options and their implications, stating that the treatment will be covered in the next part of the video. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to assess whether different treatment approaches might improve or worsen the quality of life for individuals with Spina Bifida. This is why it is rated as 1; it does not address how treatment choices affect overall quality of life.","2

The transcript primarily serves as an introduction to the condition of Spina Bifida, its types, causes, and some associated complications. However, it falls short of addressing treatment choices in a comprehensive manner. While it mentions that the treatment largely depends on the type of Spina Bifida, it does not delve into what those potential treatments might be or if there are multiple options available for each type. By stating that the diagnosis and treatment will be covered in the next part of the video, it leaves the audience with incomplete information regarding treatment choices.

A more informative video would have at least hinted at potential treatments or approaches, even in a brief manner, to give the viewers a sense of what lies ahead. Because the transcript does not provide any treatment options or discuss the possibility of multiple treatments, it is not clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice.

This will result in an uncoordinated and disordered development of the nerves into the lower limbs with a afinalistic innervation of the different muscles. It normally consists in a full palsy of the muscles and sometimes in some spasticity of the residual part of those. It is probably due to a lack of folic acid during pregnancy that will not allow the meninges to develop properly.

RlkrW3AW0ZU,"Open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect the spine and spinal cord. Myelomeningocele, or MMC and Myeloschisis are both serious forms of spina bifida and occur when a baby’s spine, spinal cord and spinal canal don’t close as they normally would. Spina bifida occurs in the first three to four weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when the spinal cord is forming. At this point, a baby’s developing brain and spine are referred to as the “neural tube.” Normally, during these first few weeks of development, the two sides of a baby's back fold to form a tube called the spinal cord. If a baby has an open neural tube defect, the neural tube doesn’t close completely, leaving a small gap. This is the defect. With an open neural tube defect such as MMC, the bones of the spine don’t completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. Because the spinal canal remains open, the spinal cord and meninges protrude from the baby’s back. Babies with MMC-type spina bifida can have a sac protruding from the opening in the spine. This sac may contain: cerebrospinal fluid, nerves, and parts of the spinal cord. At the Colorado Fetal Care Center, MMC is surgically repaired in utero with either an open procedure or the newly developed fetoscopic surgery. During open surgery, an anesthesiologist will put the mother to sleep in order to relax the uterus. The anesthesia passes through the placenta to the unborn child. Then, incisions are made in the abdomen to open the mother’s belly and uterus. The baby’s spine and defect are then exposed. From there, the defect is repaired and the skin of the baby’s back is closed over the opening to protect their still-developing neural tissue. Following open surgery, the baby will be delivered via c- section. The fetoscopic surgery involves opening up the mother’s belly like during the open surgery, but instead of cutting into the uterus, tiny incisions are made and instruments are inserted to access the baby and repair the defect. Following fetoscopic surgery, the baby can be delivered vaginally. The Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation. Here, you will have individualized care with experts who have spent years researching, innovating and performing repairs of spina bifida.

Explanation: This video transcript primarily focuses on describing the medical condition of open neural tube defects such as spina bifida, specifically Myelomeningocele (MMC), and outlines the surgical treatments available for this condition, including open surgery and fetoscopic surgery. However, it does not discuss how these treatment options affect the overall quality of life for patients or their families. While it does provide detailed medical information about the procedures themselves, including the steps involved and potential outcomes related to the surgeries, it does not address long-term impacts on living with the condition post-treatment. Key factors such as mobility, neurological function, independence, disability management, social integration, and psychological well-being, which are crucial to understanding quality of life, are not mentioned. Hence, the video falls short of describing how treatment choices directly influence overall quality of life, leading to a score of 1.","Score: 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides a detailed explanation of the condition known as spina bifida and specifically focuses on types such as Myelomeningocele (MMC) and Myeloschisis. It clearly outlines two different treatment options available at the Colorado Fetal Care Center: open surgery and fetoscopic surgery. Both procedures are described with considerable detail, explaining the steps involved and outcomes expected. This indicates that there are more than one possible treatment choices available for this condition. 

However, the transcript could be clearer about whether these are the only treatment choices or if there could be other interventions or considerations, such as postnatal surgery, conservative management, or the role of multidisciplinary care including physiotherapy, neurology, and other specialties. Additionally, while it mentions the advantages of both surgeries, it does not discuss any potential drawbacks, alternative centers with different methods, or other nuanced aspects such as patient-specific factors that might influence treatment choices.

The aims of the video are vaguely discernible but not clear. While the video ostensibly aims to document the speaker's experience with treatments for flat feet, the transcript lacks a coherent structure that explicitly lays out this goal. The narrative is largely distracted by interjections, nonspecific expressions of pain (""Ahhhh"", ""Whoop""), and an informal conversational style that diminishes clarity. Viewers might infer the treatment theme, but it is muddled by the lack of precise focus.

Moreover, there are several moments where the conversation veers off-topic or becomes hard to follow due to fragmented speech, casual banter, and repeated affirmations like ""Okay"".

The explanations about conditions like neuroma and the treatments are vague and interspersed with exclamations and unclear dialogue. There is minimal engagement with medical expertise or detailed explanations that could help the audience understand the condition or the relevance of the treatment being shown. Additionally, the frequent interjections and repetitive phrases dilute the informational value of the video.

The aims of the video are partially clear. From the transcript, we can gather that the primary focus is on addressing the speaker's long-standing issue with flat feet through a session at a physiotherapy clinic. The video includes a demonstration of a specific treatment method, myofascial release, as well as exercises meant to strengthen the foot core muscles. Additionally, the video aims to provide information about the clinic and its services to encourage viewers to seek similar help if they have related issues.

However, the video's primary aim is somewhat diluted by the speaker's expressions of anxiety and pain, which take up a significant portion of the dialogue. This emphasis on personal experience, while authentic and engaging, may overshadow the educational and informative intent.

However, the video also appears to have a significant amount of filler content focused on the personal anxiety, pain reactions, and tangential commentary of the individual undergoing treatment. While these elements can make the video more relatable and engaging for viewers, they can also distract from the informative content.

The parts where the physiotherapists explain the treatments are relatively clear, and the procedural details offer some educational value. Despite this, the video is heavily interspersed with the personal reactions and anxieties of the individual undergoing treatment, which, while engaging, might distract from clearly presented medical information or context about when these techniques were developed or vetted.

First, it allows viewers to see a real patient's experience with a medical procedure (myofascial release for flat feet and plantar fasciitis), which provides authentic insight. The presence of professionals from the physiotherapy clinic explains the procedure, which adds credibility and lends balance by including expert opinions.

However, there are several factors that detract from achieving a fully balanced and unbiased presentation. The majority of the video is focused on the personal anxieties and fears of the patient, which skews the narrative toward a subjective experience. While sharing personal feelings is valuable for viewer engagement, it can overshadow the more objective, informative aspects. The promotional tone towards the end, where the patient recommends the physiotherapy clinic and mentions their social media details, introduces an element of bias.

Additionally, the therapist’s disclaimer that results are not immediate and that it would take continued practice highlights that there is no guaranteed quick fix. However, the video does not delve deeply into broader uncertainties about the treatment effectiveness or potential variations in outcomes among different individuals, nor does it cover the theoretical or scientific uncertainties surrounding myofascial release and associated exercises.

-Ot-dP1xST4,"Up-right sprinting, one of the biggest common mistakes during upright sprinting is for the athletes to be tosey. This is what Jene calls it and I really agree. Landing on the toes or landing only on the ball of the foot. We want to land flat-footed, meaning getting that door side flex movement with the foot before you hit the ground. Heel barely misses the ground, she's landing flat. So our way of fixing it, as we talked about, our philosophy is to use forced mechanics drills versus only talking about things. She's going to give me A-skips, a two-stroke movement up to the Z down, but now you're going to land on your heel. So can you just get your foot up, hit your heel a little bit, just get some kinesthetic awareness to remind yourself of the part of the foot that will be hitting the ground. This is very safe and very appropriate. So come up to the Z, land on the heel, very controlled, just feel landing on the heel. Go ahead. Just a regular A-skip. On the heel, on the heel, the part that you hit. Now we're really teaching the door side flex movement and getting her to land on the heel to really get her toes up. A little exaggeration to make sure that she's getting the constant. You're going to turn around. Now I want you to hit your heels one more time just to remind yourself, this is the contact of the point to the ground. You're going to give me B-skips, landing on the heel. Before you go, can you get your toe up, just get your foot up, dangle your toe down. Now her foot coming to the ground, now her leg is so long, we want to make sure that the leg is short so it can swing quicker to the ground because the faster it comes down to the ground, the more force you get out of the ground, the more productive you'll be during the air mechanics, the flight phase of the sprinting. In baseball, if you have a hitter that's swinging the bat and they're slow, what they do in baseball, they bring them a shorter bat to be able to swing quicker. In sprinting, a longer foot, a longer leg will swing slow, produces less force, thus sprint slower. Now we want to make sure that that foot, that leg is shorter by getting door side flexion and make sure that we're landing flat-footed to take advantage of her powerful calf muscles. So give us B-skips, landing on the heel. Calfs close to the hamster on the way up, then land on the heel. Take a break, walk back here. Great job. If you want to just come back here. Now recovery mechanics in upright sprinting, just get the calf close to the hamster, get up to the Z. Yep. One more time. From the ground, pull it forward to calf to hamstring. Bam. This is what we're looking for in recovery mechanics. It makes her leg shorter, thus can swing up faster. Thus, she'll be faster. If that angle is too open, looking not like a Z, like an L, that's a capital L for me. That's a uppercase L. That's a longer lever will make the thigh swing slower coming up. This is not what we're looking for. We want to come up quick, calf to hamster to the Z, then push directly down. Do it again. Come up, push directly down. This is what we're looking for. We're going to add one little thing. We're going to do A skips on the heel, stretching your arms up. If the athletes are slacky, if they're broken at the hips, they're basically losing a lot of force. It's as if you're trying to shoot a cannon out of a canoe. Your force is going all over the place. We want to have a stable posture because this is our platform to apply force. Stick your arms up there, making sure that she's tall at the hips, knees, and ankles. Come up to the Z and land, just A skip movement, land on the heel. Go ahead. Stay tall and land on the heel. Stay in tall and land in a dorsiflexion, getting the heel close to the butt and the way up to make sure that we have a shorter lever at recovery, which will make it faster. Now we're going to do B skips, stretching the arm up, making sure that we're stiff and tall so not wasting force. Land on the heel as well. Stretch your arm up. Calf close to the hamster on the way up, shorter recovery, and land on the heel. Great dorsiflexion, great tall body, stable body posture.

This incision is used to protect nerves and tissues, which will allow for optimal scar healing. A saw template is used to make an accurate cut through the calcaneus bone. The template is secured to the bone by lightly tapping the pins in the template with a mallet. A saw is then used to make a precise cut through the bone. Once the cut has been made, the saw template is removed. The template will leave two perfectly sized holes for placement of guide pins. The calcaneal step plate is secured with two locking drill guide towers and then placed over these guide pins. One of the pins is removed and a drill is placed through the tower for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the first screw. The drill guide is removed and the first screw is securely locked into place. This step is repeated for the second screw placement. Following placement of the second screw, the drill guides are then attached to the next available slots in the plate and used to push the cut portion of the heel towards the internal side of the heel. An S-shaped guide can also be used to assist the surgeon in pushing the heel into an accurate position. While maintaining this position, the surgeon will then place a drill guide through a slot in the plate, which will allow the surgeon to compress the plate with a screw into a secure and accurate position. Once the compression screw has been placed, the surgeon will then proceed to use the drill guide towers for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the remaining screws, to secure the plate into its final locked position against the heel bone.

However, the transcript does not discuss or mention the possible outcomes or consequences if no treatment is applied. There is no information about what might happen if the condition requiring the surgical procedure is left untreated. To answer the specific question effectively, the video would need to include details on the natural progression of the underlying condition without any medical intervention, potential risks, and complications that could arise from not addressing the problem surgically. Since the transcript provides no such information, it warrants a score of 1, indicating that the video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used.","Score: 2

Explanation: 

The video transcript provided primarily focuses on the technical and procedural aspects of a surgical procedure involving an L-shaped skin incision and the placement of a calcaneal step plate. It details each step meticulously, including incision, placement of templates, drilling, and securing screws, and emphasizes the precision and care taken during the procedure. 

However, while it briefly mentions that the design of the low-profile step plate is such that the patient ""should not feel any screws or hardware,"" this is the extent of the discussion on the impact on the patient's quality of life. There is no comprehensive discussion on how the treatment improves or affects overall quality of life post-surgery, such as pain levels, mobility, recovery time, long-term outcomes, or potential complications that might impact daily living.

Thus, while there is a slight mention related to patient comfort, it is minimal and does not adequately address how the treatment choices holistically impact the patient's overall quality of life, resulting in a score","Score: 1

Explanation: The video transcript provides a detailed step-by-step description of a specific surgical procedure for dealing with the calcaneus (heel bone). It explains the surgical steps, the tools used, and the meticulous care taken to ensure accurate placement of hardware and optimal healing. However, the transcript does not mention any alternative treatment options or approaches. It solely focuses on the procedural aspects of one particular surgical method and the related equipment. 

In the context of the question, the transcript does not indicate that there are multiple treatment choices or variances in the approach to treating conditions related to the heel bone. By failing to reference any alternative procedures, therapies, or non-surgical options, the transcript gives the impression that this is the singular method for addressing the problem. Therefore, based on the information provided in the transcript, the video is not clear about the existence of multiple possible treatment choices, leading to the score of 1.","Score: 1

Explanation: The transcript of the YouTube video predominantly provides a detailed, step-by-step description of a surgical procedure involving the calcaneus (heel bone). While the procedure is explained comprehensively, the content is highly technical and seems directed towards an audience with a medical background such as surgeons or medical students. There is no mention of shared decision-making elements, such as discussions about the risks and benefits of the procedure, alternative treatment options, the patient's values and preferences, or the involvement of the patient in the decision-making process regarding their treatment.

Effective shared decision-making involves the clinician explaining medical information in a way that is understandable to the patient, engaging the patient in discussions about their preferences, expectations, and values, and ultimately reaching a mutually agreed-upon treatment decision. None of these aspects are addressed in the transcript, which is why it scores a 1.

1LogN1M_dyY,"- Hey, have you struggled to fix your flat feet all your life? Well, today I'm gonna show you how I went from this, to this. (bright music) - Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health, where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do it yourself programs. The exercise in question is the arch raise. I'm gonna show you how to do it, and then I'm gonna explain to you why it's proper execution is crucial to fixing your flat feet. To perform this exercise, you've got three key points. Number one is, as you lift yourself off the floor, like so, you're trying to move your Achilles tendon out this way, so it's like you're trying to roll your ankle out this way as you lift your foot. Key point number two is, as you roll your ankle out, you're trying to keep the big toe mound on the floor, as much as possible, so you've got your ankle rolling out one way, and you've got your forefoot rolling in the other way. That's two key points so far. The third key point is, as you come up on your heels, try not to grip the floor with your toes. Your toes will be somewhat active, but they shouldn't be trying to scrunch the ground like this as you lift your heel, because that will get in the way of getting that pure big toe mound bend that is essential to this exercise. To understand how this exercise helps, let's review the conditions of success of a strong and staple foot. Among those conditions are, a vertical Achilles tendon when seen from behind the ankle, and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then your Achilles tendon when seen from behind is probably going to be angled inward, and in this exercise, we're training your ability to roll your ankle out, moving that Achilles tendon from that inward pointing position to an outward pointing position. Outwards, so that you now have the range to get it right back in the center when you need it to be there. But if that's all you have, if you're only able to roll your ankle out to get your Achilles tendon to be vertical, without changing the rest of your foot, then you've got this big toe mound that's off the floor, and that's not a very stable foot either. That's where the second key point of this exercise comes in, which is intend to press the big toe mound onto the floor, even as you are rolling your ankle outwards. What this does is it reinforces your ability to create that foot tripod position while you maintain a vertical Achilles tendon. Lastly, the third key point, you need to be able to keep your toes relatively relaxed compared to what the rest of your foot is doing, because if your toes are stuck in this death grip mode, then, when you raise your heel off the floor, you're not gonna be able to keep your big toe mound pushing into the floor. Your toes need to relax in order for you to get that big toe mound pressing into the floor, creating that foot tripod that we want. Now that you understand the three key points of this exercise, and the why behind them, if you're having trouble performing this exercise exactly the way that I'm showing it to you, then feel free to modify this exercise. For example, if you're having trouble staying balanced, and that's really throwing off your ability to get at three key points, then maybe stand at a wall, maybe hold onto a stick as you're performing it, maybe take a wider stance, do what you need to do to get the three key points. Now, you may be wondering, ""How many sets, how many reps of this exercise should I do?"" The answer to that is it depends. What does it depend on? Depends on what does it take for you to be able to get a training effect from this exercise. That means if this is your first day, and you really need to slow down your reps to feel the right stuff happening, and you're only able to get five total reps because of that, that's totally fine, do five super, super, super slow reps. Do what you need to do to feel like something has changed after you've done the exercise. Perhaps in a month, after you're more used to this exercise and you're just using it for your warmups, for maybe after your lifting sessions, and you're able to pump out, let's say 30 reps, and they're all pretty quick, and you like it that way, and you feel like that gives you a training effect as opposed to the five super slow reps that you started with, then do that. The principle here is do what you need to do to get a training effect from this exercise. That does it for this exercise.

should be doing and when you should be doing it because there's a lot of benefits to both of them and there's a lot of negatives to both of them as well my name is tony jeffries olympic bronze medalist former undefeated professional seven times national champion european champion welcome to my youtube channel big thank you to sam kirkdale for requesting this video in the comments below guys if you've got any video requests you want me to make please let me know in the comments below i'll be reading them all so should you be on your toes should you be flat-footed it's funny because when i turned professional after having a very successful amateur career where i was on my toes a lot everyone told us tony you need to slow down you need to plant your feet and throw them punches but a lot of them people were wrong and i'm going to tell you exactly why first thing i'm going to break down is flat-footed the pros and cons of being flat-footed so the biggest pro of being flat-footed is you can generate more power in your punches so when i'm here i'm flat-footed and as you can see i'm generating a lot of power right there as long as you're turning your hips and fully extending exhaling doing all the right things you can generate so much power when you've got your feet planted here then also your balance is better when you're flat-footed compared to being up on your toes you're flat-footed you can throw my balance is really good there throwing these longer combinations guys i've done a full video on how to keep your balance when throwing long combinations you can check that one out after here and yes balance is very important once you've got your feet planted you get really good balance and kind of following on with your balance is you can work better inside when your feet is planted so i'm inside so now because these feet are planted that can work great inside and another massive benefit of being flat-footed is you're saving more energy if you're walking around the ring like this you know you're not using much energy at all so you can save a lot more energy so let me tell you about the cons of being flat-footed the first one is your punches from the outside are generally slower because you're flat-footed yeah your punches are going to be slower and then for me the worst thing about being flat-footed is you're relying on head moving and reactions for defense you'll be inside and the only way you can really defend is by you moving your head blocking here taking the punches here if you're not moving your feet to defend it's very risky because that means you're always in range to get hit now on your toes the pros and cons of being on your toes the number one is you've got better defense if you're on your toes you can defend better and footwork is by far the best defense that you can do because if you think about it if i'm here and someone throws a punch and i step back i've got out the way the punch but if they if the punch is coming and it is landing and i'm stepping at the same time it's going to take the sting out of the punch so footwork defense is the best sort of defense you can do so when i'm on my toes i'm gonna be in and out defending always ready for that punch coming back and getting out the way of it also a big massive pro for this is you can punch faster yes you can punch faster when you're on your toes i've done a video on how they instantly punch faster check that out and one of the things that i talk about is moving in and out with your feet when i'm moving in and out with my feet i punch faster and Manny Pacquiao was an absolute master at doing this he would step and punch at the same time and that's how he generated so much hand speed another thing it looks better you look like a better fighter when you're here on your toes compared to here plodding forward you know this doesn't really look very good but if you're on your toes that looks way better but for me the big one is the defense moving in and out keeping your opponent thinking and this is why i prefer to be on my toes compared to being flat footed and there is a time and a place for both but now let's get on to the cons of being on your toes the biggest one is it uses more energy but what one of my old amateur boxing trainers David Binns who was an amazing coach he still is amazing coach used to tell us was if you can box on your toes and box like that for four two minute rounds you can do it for 12 three minute rounds all it comes down to is conditioning now if you look at someone like Muhammad Ali in his early days he was a master at moving around on his toes so that kind of dismisses that con about using more energy even though it does you've just got to condition yourself to be able to do it for longer now another con is that your punches is not going to be as hard but when you mix it up on your toes with plant in your feet you can still punch hard that's why you should master both of them being on your toes and being flat footed and then the other con i guess is balance you know you you might be losing your balance when you're moving around trying to throw these punches but when you practice this you're only going to get better at it and you're never going to lose your balance so which one should you be practicing guys before i tell you this please if you haven't already subscribed this channel hit that bell notification to get notified every time i upload a boxing education video like this one also give me a like any comments below i'll be reading them all so you should be practicing both a bit of both i would advise practicing more on your toes because it's harder to box on your toes like this than it is flat footed so once you master moving in and out being on your toes working on them fast punches all of the pros that i said about being on your toes then you can work on being flat footed but i believe so much that working on your footwork is very important footwork is the most important thing in boxing without your feet underneath you you're going to be probably useless everywhere else there's not many great fighters who didn't have great footwork

Explanation: The video partially addresses areas of uncertainty regarding the debate on whether it is better to be on your toes or flat-footed in boxing. Tony Jeffries, the presenter, outlines both the pros and cons of each stance, thereby acknowledging that there is no one-size-fits-all answer and that both methods have their distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the context.

For instance, Jeffries discusses how being flat-footed can lead to generating more power and better balance but makes punches slower and defense more reliant on head movements. Conversely, being on the toes enhances defense through better footwork and faster punches but consumes more energy and may compromise punching power. This balanced comparison illustrates the complex considerations and personal preferences that must be weighed, indicating a recognition of uncertainty in choosing the optimal stance.

However, the video does not deeply delve into the nuances of situational variability—such as how different fighters might employ these techniques differently based on style, strategy, or conditioning—nor does it explore","**Score: 1**

GPS10HfgYDY,"Flat feet are typically caused by a bone inside the foot that is hypermobile and comes out of alignment. It's called the talus bone. And if you can use the analogy of a stone bridge, that if you have stones that come up to the center of the bridge, and you pluck out that middle stone, then the bridge collapses. Well, essentially, in the foot, the talus bone, which is inside the ankle joint, acts like that stone bridge and that center stone. And typically what happens with a flat foot is that the talus bone migrates forward on ambulation. So when a person steps down and puts their full weight, the talus moves forward like this, which then causes the midfoot to unlock. And then you have a flat foot. Now, we do have treatments for this condition. And typically you do want to treat a flat foot because if you don't, there can be issues with ankle pain, with knee pain, hip pain, and back pain. Because if you can imagine your base is out of alignment, then the rest of your joints can become out of alignment. Which our thought is that this can cause arthritis at a premature age and various kinds of joint pains up the extremity, up the kinetic chain.

There you go. - I actually do not have flat feet - Right, but we're, we'll get this. Let's show you how to do it. Can we zoom into the arch of the foot here? Right there? Bob's got a nice arch Yeah. Now I want you to flatten out a little bit and when you put weight on it, this gap right here where my fingers are, this bone right here will actually come down and some people make contact with the floor.

So that's what we're calling flat foot or pronation in the therapy world. - [Bob] Right. - Okay. So what happens is the tissues underneath here, the plantar, the bottom tissues when your foot splays out, they get stretched. And over time they can continue to stretch, stretch stretch. And like I said, get that navicular bone right down to the tape right down to the floor which is not what you want. So some supportive shoes which I'll talk about in a little bit, the next thing if we go up to the knee, what happens to the mechanics of the leg when that foot pronates and flattens out the tibia rotates this direction this way. So look at the red tape right there. It goes in and we got a little rotation there and that can throw the mechanics of the knee off slightly. Therefore you can, you know, get some arthritis arthritic changes prematurely in the knee, Bob. - [Bob] It's amazing how the slightest little change there can affect this and that can affect pain - Yep, and create problems along the way But wait, Bob, there's more. - [Bob] Yes, there is more - Okay.

So you can see both knees are starting to get knock kneed because I'm flat foot. And you see that quite often on people, Brad they're walking along and I can see their they're flat feet are causing them to be knock kneed. - Right. It's going right up the chain. And then even up into the hip, the femur will rotate in and that can put some stress on the posterior muscles on the back side of the hip and into the the joint itself. Again can cause problems as we age prematurely as if you, you know, if you didn't have. - It's like a little hole in the dam, isn't it. - Right. So what's a easy way to correct this. We do have a video with some exercises that can help this. - Sure. - But you know, the, the probably the better way is to get the proper pair of footwear for this. And you can do this without getting custom footwear for five or $600, depending on the severity of your case. But let me get a shoe here. And if you go and you're gonna ask for to a good shoe store and say, I need a pair of shoe for flat footed people or technically they called motion control shoes. If you say the term motion control, - I'll put the word down below Brad, - Any good salesperson should know exactly what you're talking about.

It's very thick and it's, it's that way. So support so that when your foot flattens it supports it. - Right. - And, and if you do this to motion control shoe you will not have this bend. It'll be like, almost like a board and just a tip bend a little bit. - Sure. Very, very stiff. - They're gonna be about 150 bucks or so dependent on what you get, so buy 'em on sale.

1. The presenters acknowledge that not everyone with flat feet will experience knee or hip issues, noting it depends on the severity (""If you are flat-footed, this may not happen to you. Depends how severe it is"").
2. They discuss general mechanical processes and anatomical consequences of having flat feet but do not dive deeply into uncertainties regarding why these issues manifest more severely in some people than others.
3. The recommendation for footwear is given as a general solution without delving into the variability in shoe efficacy among different individuals (""depending on the severity of your case"").

While the video provides useful information on the subject, it does not fully explore the nuances and uncertainties in a detailed manner, such as the range of outcomes in diverse populations or how different factors might","**Score: 2**

**Explanation:**

The video transcript provides a detailed account of how flat feet affect the mechanics of the body, including the feet, knees, and hips. The conversation is anchored in anatomical explanations, discussing how flat feet or pronation can lead to certain mechanical changes that propagate up to the knees and hips. This includes descriptions of specific structural changes, such as the rotation of the tibia and the stress on the medial collateral ligament (MCL).

However, when it comes to actual treatments, the video falls short in explaining how each treatment works. The primary treatment mentioned is using motion control shoes, which the video explains are designed to support the foot and prevent it from flattening. Although the transcript mentions that such shoes have a stiff sole to provide support, it does not delve further into the mechanics or the rationale behind how the shoes actually help to mitigate the problems caused by flat feet. 

Additionally, there's mention of exercises that could help, but the transcript does not discuss","**Rating: 2**

**Explanation:**

The video transcript does not fully describe the benefits of each treatment. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Detailed Problem Description**: While the video provides a comprehensive explanation of how flat feet can lead to issues in the feet, knees, and hips due to mechanical misalignment, it spends more time on the problem than on the solutions.
  
2. **Mentioned Treatments**: The primary treatments suggested are supportive shoes, specifically motion control shoes, and a reference to another video with exercises. However, the benefits of these treatments are not thoroughly explained.

3. **Lack of Detailed Benefits**:
   - **Supportive Shoes**: The video mentions that motion control shoes can help support the arch and prevent excessive foot flattening, thus alleviating some issues. However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of the specific benefits of these shoes, such as reduced pain, improved posture, or prevention of future injuries.

**Explanation:**
The video transcript provided scores a 1 because it does not explicitly discuss the risks associated with the treatment options for flat feet. 

Throughout the video, Bob and Brad focus on explaining the mechanics of flat feet and how it can affect the knees and hips. They discuss the anatomical changes that occur and the potential long-term effects such as arthritis and ligament stress. They briefly mention supportive shoes and motion control shoes as potential solutions but fail to address any potential risks or downsides associated with these treatments. 

For example, they do not discuss whether using motion control shoes could lead to any adverse effects such as discomfort, inadequate support for high arch feet, or potential muscle weakening from over-reliance on shoe support. Also, they mention exercises but do not delve into the risks of improper execution or overuse.

Overall, while the video provides useful information on the mechanics and some solutions for flat feet, it lacks a thorough discussion of the risks involved with the treatments","**Score: 3**

The video transcript partially addresses the consequences of not seeking treatment for flat feet, but it doesn't do so comprehensively. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Mechanics and Damage Explanation**: The transcript goes into detail about how flat feet can lead to problems in the feet, knees, and hips. It describes the condition's progression and the potential harm to various parts of the body like the plantar tissues, navicular bone, knee ligaments, and hip muscles. This indirectly suggests what could happen if flat feet are not treated since these changes and damages are the direct consequences of untreated flat feet.

2. **Long-term Effects**: The transcript explains that untreated flat feet can lead to stretched tissues, rotated tibia, stress on the medial collateral ligament (MCL), and potential arthritis in the knee joints. There is also mention of knock knees and premature joint problems. This indicates long-term effects on lower limb mechanics and overall mobility.

3. **Lack of Explicit","Score: 1

Explanation:
The video very minimally addresses the impact of treatment choices on overall quality of life. The primary focus of the transcript is on the mechanics of flat feet and their effect on lower extremity joints, such as the knees and hips. While it does mention that proper footwear, like motion control shoes, can help alleviate some issues, it doesn't elaborate on how these treatment choices affect broader aspects of quality of life, such as daily functioning, emotional well-being, or social participation. 

Quality of life in a medical context encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects of a person's life. This video largely discusses anatomical and biomechanical concepts and provides some general advice on footwear, but it falls short in connecting these points to how they would influence the patient's overall life experience.

SEocnyAGcFg,"The Arthrex internal brace spring ligament augmentation repair is a surgery for people who have flat foot due to weakness or rupture of the spring ligament or posterior tibial tendon. Spring ligament is the connecting tissue located under the foot that connects the calcaneus and the vicular bone. This ligament is often repaired in people that have a condition called flat foot. It is when the arch of the foot collapses, coming into contact with the ground. The repair begins with the surgeon making a cut on the side of the ankle where the calcaneus, vicular bone, and medial cuneiform are located. Next, the surgeon will create a bone tunnel by drilling into the sesentaculum tali of the calcaneus using a guide wire and drill guide. The bone tunnel is made in the calcaneus to prepare for a Swiveloc suture anchor loaded with fiber tape. The Swiveloc anchor is screwed into place. Next, the FDL tendon, also known as flexor digitorum longus, located on the medial side of the leg is identified, cut, and then tagged with a fiber loop stitching technique. A bone tunnel is made in the navicular to prepare for an additional Swiveloc anchor. The ankle structures are tensioned and fixed into place by taking one part of the fiber tape and passing it from top to bottom with a suture passing wire. Then, take the other part of the fiber tape with the sutures from the FDL tendon and passing it from bottom to top. The surgeon then holds it in place by inserting the Swiveloc from bottom to top. The remaining sutures are cut. The supporting structures of the arch of the foot are now repaired and held together with the internal brace, causing the arch of the foot to be restored.",Flat Feet,4,4,5,1,3,2,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,2,"**Score: 4**

Explanation:

The video partially describes how the treatment works. Dr. Luo explains the taping methodology in some detail, demonstrating how to support Griffin's arch using coverall and leukotape. Several aspects are covered thoroughly, such as the importance of subtalar neutral position, the purpose of each type of tape, and the specific anatomical targets like the navicular bone and medial longitudinal arch. The explanation includes practical tips on application and why it would provide temporary relief from plantar fasciitis. 

However, the video lacks a comprehensive description of how the taping alleviates plantar fasciitis at a more biological or physiological level. While it mentions support for the arch and reducing stress on the posterior tibialis tendon, it doesn't go into detail about the underlying mechanisms of pain relief or how the support structure benefits the muscles and tendons over time. Additional insights into the interaction between the tape and the foot's biomechanics would have enhanced the understanding of how this treatment option works. Therefore","**Rating: 3 (Partially)**

The transcript provides a partial description of the benefits of the taping treatment for plantar fasciitis. Dr. Luo explains that the taping method is designed to support the arch of the foot temporarily, which can relieve some symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis by preventing the foot from collapsing and altering gait mechanics. The taping supports the medial longitudinal arch and reduces stress on certain tendons like the posterior tibialis, which can help if there is tendonitis present.

However, the video does not delve deeply into a comprehensive list of benefits for each treatment stage. While it mentions that the taping is supportive and provides temporary relief, it doesn't offer much detail on how this translates to functional improvement, pain reduction levels, or long-term outcomes.

Here we see her walking at normal speed. Notice the toes also trying to help out. And the just complete collapse of her arch and where her ankles are. We're going to see shortly what she looks like after reconstruction and correction. Here you really see how devastating this flat foot is. This is also very mentally challenging for patients, especially women. Now this is her after she had her right side done. About four months after surgery. You can see the comparison between the right and the left. She's still not walking quite normally yet because of the imbalance of only having one foot corrected. But there's a pretty stark difference between both. Now you'll see the amazing transformation that Lorelei underwent having these procedures done. And now that her muscles have acclimated to the new position. Her knees are in better position. Her gait is significantly improved. She can function now. This truly was a remarkable transformation for Lorelei both mentally and physically. You're now going to hear from Lorelei who's a bit on the shy side.

And now it's not such a bad problem. It's getting better. And how about from just the mental aspect of it for you? By that I mean, you know, when you had those really flat feet, were you depressed about it? Were you unhappy? Did you notice it? I mean, now that you have feet that are not flat anymore, is there any difference there? I noticed it when I wore shoes that the shoes would cave in on the inside and I didn't like that. Okay. I don't know. That upset me. Okay. And is that happening anymore? No. No. So your shoes are not breaking down on you? Yeah. Okay. And so for anyone with flat feet like yours, you would say this is definitely something they should do? Yeah. I understand that when you were doing cheerleading, that when you would take your shoes off, some of the kids would make fun of you. Is that true? Yes. I'm sure that didn't go over so well.

fcLsOB0jtp0,"Hi, thank you for considering us for your concerns and needs for your flat feet. So what is flat feet? Flat feet is basically a collapsed arch and oftentimes this happens because the muscles that are deep inside your foot are weak or too relaxed and overstretched and that's why there's a flattening of your feet. Now what are the problems that can happen with flat feet? Sometimes our symptoms are related to the inability to be able to push, run, walk well, climb stairs and also a lot of times you end up with little symptoms like plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendonitis or heel pain. Now what we get to do here at Rehab and Revive is to work your whole body holistically and have the strategies that help things like your walking pattern and more importantly is to stabilize and enhance your hip structures, your knee structures and your ankle structures before we get after the feet and reconstruct with little exercises those muscles that need to prop your arch back.

jzJZRl4tN4M,"You've probably heard the term flatfoot or pes planus. I'm sure you've even heard some of your friends or colleagues discussing the flatfoot as well. And I'm sure there's a few of you out there who've been diagnosed with having a flatfoot. As a podiatrist, it's one of the questions that I most often get asked. Do I have a flatfoot? My name is Gerard. I'm a podiatrist here at Singapore General Hospital. Let me tell you a little bit more about flatfoot. Flatfoot is a common condition that affects the Asian population. Estimates suggest it occurs one in every five individuals. To identify someone with flat feet, you need to observe the way a person stands or walks. During standing or walking, those with flat feet tend to flatten their inner foot or arch. Furthermore, the foot may roll over to the inner side. However, for children under the ages of 10 who may not have fully developed foot arches, assessing whether a child has flatfoot can be difficult. There are a number of contributing factors for flat feet. Often hereditary causes may contribute to having certain tight or weak muscles or even ligament laxity. Also, poor footwear can play a major role in causing flat feet. For example, wearing shoes that limit toe movements such as high heels when young can lead to flat feet in adulthood. Having a flat foot does not necessarily increase the incidence of injury, nor does it usually cause a problem. However, flat feet may put a strain on your muscles, ligaments and joints, which can cause pain in your feet, legs, hips and back when you stand or walk. Furthermore, individuals with flat feet tend to develop tired or aching feet after prolonged periods of walking or standing. Treatment is only required if the flat foot causes pain in the foot or lower limb. Besides treatment, there are exercises you can do to improve your flat foot condition. It is important to perform these exercises in a safe and comfortable position. Stop immediately and inform your podiatrist if you experience any pain. To ensure your safety is maintained during exercise, pick an appropriate time to do the exercises. Be well rested and ensure your symptoms are well controlled by your medication. Exercise at your own pace. Avoid jerking or bouncing, instead maintain a comfortable and sustained stretch. Perform these exercises several times at one go and do them repeatedly throughout the day. Sit barefoot in a chair and place a small hand towel on the floor in front of you. Place the ball of your foot on the edge of the towel and reaching out with your toes as far as you can, grab the towel and scrunch it back towards you, bunching it under your foot. Keep reaching out and grabbing more towel until you run out. Repeat on the other foot. Stand on a step with only the ball of your foot on the board and the rest of your heel and foot hanging slightly below the toes. Start with your foot in a neutral position and raise up to your tiptoes by pressing down with your toes. When you lower, resist the urge to drop to your heel too far below the stair line. Do three sets of stair raises ten times per set. Stretching your calf muscles can help loosen tight calf muscles that contributes to a flat foot. To stretch your calf and Achilles tendon, sit on the floor with your legs fully extended in an L shaped position and your toes pointing upwards. Place a towel or TheraBand over your forefoot and hold. Pull it towards you. You should feel the stretch at the back of your left leg below the knee. Hold the stretch for twenty to thirty seconds and repeat with the opposite leg. Repeat the stretch three times on each leg and do this exercise three to four times daily. Start with your foot. Place flat on the floor. Try raising all ten toes upwards. Hold for five seconds. Then relax and repeat ten times. Hip weakness can contribute to flat feet so it's also important to strengthen the muscles that control the outward movement of the leg. This helps to ensure that the joints of the leg stay in proper alignment. One such exercise is side lying leg raises. Begin by lying on your side with one arm bent and resting under your head. Keep both legs straight with your bottom leg touching the ground while raising your top leg one feet above your bottom leg. Hold for two seconds then return the leg to the ground to complete one rep. Perform a total of ten reps three times a day. Don't let flat feet ruin your quality of life. Get treatment today and do the exercises regularly.

Explanation: 

The transcript details a technique for addressing medial arch pain and issues related to navicular drop, both of which are specific medical concerns. Medial arch pain is a common issue that can affect individuals who have structural foot problems, engage in high-impact activities, or suffer from conditions like flat feet. Navicular drop refers to the lowering of the navicular bone, which can cause pain and discomfort in the arch of the foot.

The video outlines a step-by-step procedure for applying tape to support the medial arch, which is a therapeutic technique used in sports medicine and physical therapy. The detailed explanation includes important considerations such as protecting the retinaculum at the front of the ankle and ensuring proper tape tension and placement to avoid further injury.

For lack of a better terminology, she's walking like a duck or Charlie Chaplin. And you can see the gross deformity here. She's not able to function very well and this is a poorly functioning foot. Participating in any sporting activity is almost impossible, yet she has been a real trooper and trying to persevere. And she was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of this problem. And as you can see, that's not the case. We're now going to see the post-operative results on the right here. You can see the straight line that I drew showing the new position of the foot. Again, here we're looking on your left side, which is the right foot. We're seeing a much straighter foot with a restoration of the arch. Again, we're seeing the arch on the right foot, which is pretty dramatic, relative to the left side, which shows here no arch and a completely collapsed foot, which is not functional at all. In this picture, we're looking at the titanium calcaneal graft that was put in here to lengthen the lateral column and help restore the arch. And now we're looking at the top of the foot where a similar graft was placed into the menial cuneiform to help bring the arch more prominent. This is the preoperative x-ray where you'll note the lines that I've drawn that help indicate the deformity. Looking at the red line below in the blue, and now we can see that little blue line near the implant is now elevated along with the arch. And we can see all the implants in the foot that brought the arch up. This is the before picture where you see the foot is completely turning outward and the proximal portion is going inward. And this is the postoperative result, which is very dramatic. You can see the foot is perfectly straight now and looks much better as it did in the video. Here we're looking at her walk now three months out, which has just only been walking now for a couple of weeks, and already it's dramatic the improvement.

BuQdGkBXJOk,"Hey, have you tried a bunch of stretches to try to fix your flat feet but nothing seems to work? Well, today I'm going to show you one key stretch that I use to go from this to this. Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do-it-yourself programs. So the stretch in question is the hero pose. I'm going to show you how to do it. I'm going to show you some modifications you can try to optimize it for your body. Then I'm going to explain to you why its proper execution is crucial to improving your flat feet. So to set up for this pose, I'm going to start in tall kneeling position with my heels slightly outside of my knees and my toes pointing inward. Next, I'm going to get onto my hands and knees and slowly rock my butt back towards my heels. My butt should be landing inside of my heels so that my heels will eventually be touching the outside of my butt when I get all the way down. And my toes should still be pointing inward as I get into the full pose. Once I'm in the full pose, I'm going to aim to lengthen my spine so that when seen from the side I've got that nice neutral spine shape. I can do some anterior and posterior pelvic tilts going back and forth between the extremes to find what feels neutral, to find the zone where my sit bones feel like they're directly underneath of the rest of my spine. And from there, I'm going to try to relax as much as I can as I feel this super intense stretch around my shins and the top of my ankles. So for this stretch, I like to stay in it for as long as it takes to feel something change. That may take two minutes, it may take five minutes, it may take ten minutes. For example, when I first get into this stretch, I may not feel anything stretch around my hips, but if I allow myself to stay in it for long enough, sometimes I'll feel something let go that I did not even realize was holding tension before. So this doesn't just apply to the hips, sometimes I'll feel it in my quads, sometimes I'll feel it in my calves or my feet. Each time, I'm just aiming to feel like something has changed from the time that I got into the stretch to the time that I get out of it. And when you're done, just get out of it in a way that makes sense to you. So modifications for this stretch. If you're having a ton of discomfort getting all the way down, then what you can do is grab a couple of yoga blocks or anything that will allow you to sit your weight down without bending your knees all the way. But the key points, the key points from the full pose still apply here. So trying to keep the ankles outside of the butt, still trying to point the toes in and keep a long spine once you've rested your weight on the yoga blocks. Another modification you can try once you're comfortable with the version shown prior is you can start leaning back further and further until your back is resting all the way on the floor. But the same key points apply. You're still trying to keep your heels outside of your butt and your toes pointed inward. So now let's go into the why of this exercise. If you watched another video we made on foot training, you will remember that the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot are one, a vertical Achilles tendon and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then when you're walking around your Achilles tendon is going to be collapsed inward and your whole foot is not going to be a tripod. This exercise addresses that by improving your ability to move your Achilles tendon outward while planting your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor. How is this relevant? Well consider that if you develop the strength to roll your ankle outwards and get that Achilles tendon to be vertical, but that this causes your entire foot to lift off the floor, then you don't have that tripod anymore. To get that tripod back, you need to be able to press your big toe mound into the floor while maintaining that vertical Achilles tendon. And this exercise, it does just that. By pinning your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor as you sit back on your ankles that are rolled out, you're improving your ability to get at the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot. So that does it for this stretch. If you'd like to check out the exercise that this stretch pairs extremely well with, click the link. And if you found the video helpful, please like the video, comment, share it with anyone you know who may also find it helpful, subscribe to the channel, and as always, remember that pain sucks, life shouldn't.

Commonest type is the younger patient in their teenage or adolescent years that comes in with their parents complaining of a painless and immobile flexible flat foot. Other causes that we do see later in life usually the degenerative conditions mainly affecting the post-iliotibial tendon which will then result in gradual weakness of the foot and deformity with collapsing of the medial arch. Other conditions such as arthritic conditions and post-traumatic conditions may also present with flat foot deformities. Avoidance of flat foot deformity obviously depends on the cause and the stage of presentation. Ideally, if a patient is concerned, a full assessment by an orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist would be appropriate because the treatment may well depend on the cause and the severity. Usually, in the early stages simple orthotics and attention to correct shoe wear may help. And these would really form a medial arch support with possibly a small wedge on the inside of the orthotic and obviously a shoe with a medial support and space to fit the orthotic.

hBNstjxuGCg,"So a flat foot is when someone has lost the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. So on the big toe side you typically have a little bit higher arch than you do on the outside or the pinky toe side of the foot. And so when you've lost that, you can have pain on the inside of the foot or the arch of the foot, on the inside of the ankle. You tend to progressively notice that the arch will collapse. So once it starts to collapse it usually continues to progress. And you can even notice that the toes begin to kind of drift outward a little bit and point out to the side as opposed to pointing straight ahead as you're walking. The progression of flat foot takes months to years. It's not something that you would necessarily notice over days or weeks unless you have a traumatic rupture or injury that's causing a flat foot which can occur. But that's not the typical flat foot that we see. You can have a congenital flat foot and that's not something that necessarily needs treatment. In general we don't address a flat foot with orthotics or surgery unless the patient is having symptoms. If they're not having any pain or any issues with the function of their foot then it's just kind of one of those things that's the way you were made. So the reason that the medial longitudinal arch will collapse is usually contributed to by a tight calf muscle. When the calf muscle is tight and it increases the tension across the Achilles tendon that tries to point the foot like a ballet dancer and the ground as we're walking we don't walk on our tiptoes. And so because of the force of the ground and the tightness of the Achilles tendon the arch gets extra stress and over time can succumb to that stress and collapse. So treatment for flat foot is typically reserved for those patients that are having pain or are symptomatic from their flat foot. So if you're walking around and happen to know that you've had flat feet your whole life and they've never bothered you we don't even attempt to correct that. But if you're starting to have arch pain or you're having pain along the inside of the ankle or even the outside of the ankle typically again we always start with non-operative treatment. So that would be orthotics. Sometimes we can do injections however we try not to inject tendons due to risk of rupture for tendon injection and physical therapy to try and stretch out the calf muscle as well as strengthen the tendons and ligaments that are supposed to support the arch. Flat feet is something that we see often within the foot and ankle clinic. A lot of people coming in with medial arch pain or lateral ankle pain find out that they have flat feet and that is the cause. The majority of patients that come in for flat feet are able to be managed pretty well with conservative treatment that gives them pretty good pain relief and allows them to continue the activities that they enjoy. I would say probably 30% of patients end up having to go on to surgery and that increases with time. So maybe for 5-10 years you've done really well with orthotics and with physical therapy but as time progresses and your flat foot progresses eventually you reach a point where the pain is just too debilitating. Similar to a lot of other foot and ankle conditions it's up to the patient when it's time for surgery if they have a flat foot and they continue to have pain after we've tried therapy and injections then that's when we discuss surgical management. There's actually multiple different options for treatment for flat feet as far as surgical approaches depending on the flexibility of the foot and how mobile the foot remains and how easily we are able to correct the flat foot manually in the office as well as how much arthritis the patient has will determine what surgical option we choose or we recommend. Sometimes we're able to do that with what we consider to be joint sparing surgery meaning that we're not fusing any of the functional mobile joints so we don't stiffen the foot at all with surgery and it's mostly osteotomies and tendon transfers and maybe gastroc lengthening or calf muscle lengthening. However sometimes if the foot is more stiff and rigid or if arthritis has already set in or if it's an older patient we'll elect for arthrodesis which is the same as a fusion so we'll fuse the hind foot to stabilize the arch and to improve the function of the foot.",Flat Feet,4,4,5,1,5,4,1,3,3,4,3,3,4,5,4,"Score: 4

The video transcript offers a detailed and comprehensive explanation of flat feet, including causes, symptoms, progression, and treatment options. It appears largely balanced and provides a clear picture of the varying degrees of severity and the different approaches to management and treatment, catering to both non-operative and surgical options. 

The presenter addresses both congenital and acquired flat feet, emphasizing that many cases do not require intervention unless symptomatic. They discuss the role of calf muscle tightness in contributing to flat feet and detail conservative treatments such as orthotics, physical therapy, and the cautious use of injections.

Moreover, the transcript thoroughly describes the surgical options and the factors influencing the choice of surgical intervention. By mentioning both joint-sparing surgeries and fusions, it provides a complete view of potential outcomes and decisions based on individual patient conditions.

Explanation: 
The video transcript provides a fairly detailed description of various treatments for flat feet, such as orthotics, physical therapy, injections, and different surgical interventions. However, the discussion of risks associated with these treatments is quite limited. While it mentions the risk of tendon rupture with injections, other potential risks or complications of treatments like orthotics, physical therapy, or surgery are not extensively covered.

For instance, the complications or recovery time associated with orthotics, physical rehabilitation, and non-joint sparing surgeries (such as tendon transfers and gastroc lengthening) are not discussed. Similarly, the risks and potential downsides of joint-sparing surgeries versus more invasive procedures like arthrodesis (fusion surgery) are not explored comprehensively.

There is also mention of the progressive nature of the condition and how it eventually might lead to symptoms requiring treatment.

However, the video does not delve deeply into the full spectrum of consequences of leaving flat foot untreated for those who do develop symptoms. It does not specify the potential long-term impacts on mobility, the possible worsening of pain, or other complications like increased risk of injuries or development of arthritis in untreated cases. The focus is more on the treatment options once symptoms arise rather than a comprehensive exploration of the outcomes of no treatment. Therefore, it only partially","**Rating: 4**

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of flat foot, including its causes, progression, and treatment options. It delves into how treatment choices, such as orthotics, injections, physical therapy, and surgery, are generally contingent on the presence and severity of symptoms like pain and functional impairment. The overall quality of life considerations are implicitly addressed through discussions about non-operative treatments potentially allowing patients to continue enjoying their activities with minimal pain. Additionally, the detailed explanation of surgical options, particularly the distinction between joint-sparing and more invasive procedures like arthrodesis, hints at the balance between effective treatment and maintaining foot functionality. Consequently, this implicitly touches on the potential trade-offs affecting the patient's quality of life post-treatment.

iwX4_G6JZ_0,"Hello, my name is Lewis and I'm a podiatrist at East Coast Podiatry in Singapore and today we're talking about common problems associated with flatfoot. What is a flatfoot? So we've identified that this foot type is flat and what we tend to see is a flatfoot is more in an everted position like this. It's incredibly common, typically we see this a lot in children, especially of Asian descent. So typically, hypermobile flatfoot, which means very flexible, flexible in the joints, the knees, the arms can link to flatfoot. So the number one problem that we see with flatfoot is plantar heel pain. So with a flatfoot that's typically very flexible, we can stress the plantar muscles and tendons and ligaments on the bottom of the foot. So most commonly what we see in my clinic is plantar fasciitis or plantar heel pain, which is very common associated with flatfoot. Another problem we see very often is bunions. So due to the foot being in this position here, we can get a bunion formation on the big toe joint. Now this can be very painful. However, the good news is it can be addressed quite quickly, conservatively, if it's found at an early stage before it develops. So for us, what we look at doing is we identify the problem, okay? We identify why the problem is there and what's the root cause of it, and then we would manage that conservatively. High archfoot is typically associated with people of Caucasian descent. High archfoot is associated also with being stiff. So we see flexible flatfoot and we see often a rigid high archfoot. The rigidity and flexibility are both different. It's not better or worse. We just see different problems. What we would see more commonly an ankle sprain with a flatfoot. With a higher archfoot, we're much more likely to get shock impacts to the heel, Achilles tendon problems, and also we can get ankle sprains or even fractures as well. So high archfoot, the common problems that we see is heel pain because the calves tend to be very, very tight and we impact the ground very, very firmly with no shock absorption. Another one is arthritis of the big toe joint. This again associated with the stiffness means that with a rigid foot, we don't have the natural shock absorption and we smash the big toe into the ground, especially with runners. So lots of marathon runners, heel pain and knee pain with high archfoot is what we see. Typically for us, what we want to do is when patients come into my clinic and they say, Lewis, I've got a high archfoot or I've got a certain pain here. Once we've established the root cause of it and that we are dealing with a high archfoot, we then need to determine whether we need treatment or not. Now, these problems that I'm talking about, such as Achilles tendonitis at the back and the arthritis of the big toe at the front are very common. And we can actually address these conservatively without the need for steroids or injections or medication if we address it at the right time. So if this problem is picked up quite soon, we can normally identify the problem, identify the long term management of a higher archfoot with footwear, custom insoles to take away the pressure from these high pressure areas. If you feel that you're experiencing foot and ankle pain or any discomfort in the lower limb for that matter, hip pain, knee pain, especially with sports, if you're active, if you're elderly, if you're a junior, podiatrists are the people to see. They're experts in the lower limb. So if you're having foot and ankle problems and you feel that you may have got a high archfoot or a flat foot like this or anything that we've said today has been relevant and is applicable to you, please let us know in the comments below.

Reasoning: 

The transcript provided does not refer to areas of uncertainty regarding flat foot syndrome. Instead, it presents the issue in a definitive manner, stating statistics, problems that arise from flat feet, and the effectiveness of the diagnostic and treatment methods employed by ACC. The transcript outlines a clear cause-effect relationship between flat feet and various health problems. It asserts that ACC's technology and methods are effective without mentioning any potential limitations, uncertainties, or the need for further research. There are no references to ongoing debates in the medical community, varying opinions, or potential areas where more data is needed.

While it might implicitly invite parents to have their child's feet checked, this appeal is based on the confidence in their methods rather than a discussion of uncertainties in the current understanding or treatment of flat feet. Given the definitive and confident tone throughout the transcript, it is rated at the lowest end of the scale (1) for lacking any mention of uncertainty.","Score: 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some basic information about flat foot syndrome, its potential complications, and mentions the use of European technology and digital scanning to diagnose and treat the condition. It references the use of Swiss-made equipment and orthotics. However, the transcript lacks detailed explanations on how each treatment exactly works. It does not describe the specific mechanisms by which digital scanning, 3D modeling, or orthotic inserts correct the structural issues of flat feet. 

The video partially touches on the use of certain technologies and tools but does not elaborate on their functionality or the physiological basis of the treatment's efficacy. While it mentions that orthotics are effective and describes the assessment and manufacturing process in a broad sense, it fails to explain how these orthotics alleviate or correct symptoms and the underlying anatomical changes in flat foot syndrome.

The video transcript predominantly addresses the prevalence of flat foot syndrome among children in Asia and describes in detail the technological methods used to diagnose and treat this condition at a specific clinic (ACC). While it does highlight some consequences of untreated flat feet on a child's daily activities and potential long-term physical complications (such as difficulties playing sports, walking issues, and impacts on hips and back), it lacks depth in explaining how these treatment choices specifically affect the overall quality of life in a broader sense.

The treatment's impact is implied rather than explicitly discussed, introducing only a general notion that early intervention can lead to a ""better opportunity to enjoy life."" This broad statement falls short of providing a concrete understanding of the quality-of-life improvements post-treatment.

9tlzxA8o0w0,"Flat feet can be observed from two years old or anytime during the adult years, where the medial arch or the inner side of the foot is lowered towards the ground. If this develops during childhood, it is congenital flat foot. If it develops during adulthood, it is adult acquired flat foot. Leaving a flat foot condition without treatment can lead to long-term chronic pain. The medial arch of the foot rolls inwards, causing a chain reaction of destabilization on the ankles, knees, hips and spine. Higher up from the foot itself, the most common complaint is knee pain. This could lead to knee arthritis if it is a chronic condition. A flattened foot that has been functioning as a suboptimal orientation for so many years will eventually cause one side of the knee joint to wear out. The problem may have been prevented by correcting the feet early on in life. Flat foot is actually an umbrella term for many conditions. For example, tarsal coalition, ankle equinas, unstable OS navicule, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, midfoot arthritis, hallux upfoot for valgus and so on. Each of these conditions should be carefully considered before designing the shoe insoles. Conservative treatment for flat foot is often customized insole. Podiatrists are specialists in integrating clinical diagnosis with orthotic design, creating a specific prescription each patient needs for their optimal control and correction of the flat foot. This is never as simple as just pushing up a low arch profile with an insole. Also, podiatrists design in millimeters, not centimeters. That means our orthotic corrections must be accurate to a person's foot biomechanics by less than a fraction of a millimeter.

y6FYrADwUUs,"Flat feet affects a large percentage of the population throughout the world. Flat feet occurs because the tendons holding the joints of the foot together are loose. Dr. Aaron Bean of Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs explains this condition further and the treatments currently offered. 30 percent of adults and even kids have flat feet, the other 30 percent have a high arch foot and the rest of us have a normal type foot but probably about 30 percent of us have flat feet that may or may not hurt. There is a familiar component, we know that patients that come in even kids with a symptomatic painful flat foot, I'll always ask them, does your mom or dad have a flat foot and I'd say about 80 percent of the time they say, yea dad's got flat feet, they hurt too and we know its about time to bring him in. So definitely we think there is a genetic component. So a lot of times they get pain, the foot starts to collapse and the foot rolls in or we call pronates. So they get a lot of pain on the inside of the foot in the arch and in a severe flat foot, sometimes they'll pain on the outside of the foot or the ankle because the foot is actually collapsing and pinching the outside of the foot. Typically I start seeing kids around seven, eight years old and a lot of times these kids by the time they hit four or five years old they have a flat feet, most kids do and they grow out of it, they start to develop an arch but about seven, eight years old is when they start having pain in these feet and that's when we start seeing them come in the office and evaluate them and start a treatment program. So in the early stages especially with children, usually it's a flexible deformity. In rare cases you get an abnormal bone bridge or a congenital deformity that needs to be surgically corrected more immediately, but in most of the cases we start with a custom orthotics. So we take a mold of these children's feet- it's a match for their arch and then they wear this device that will support and lift up this flexible flat foot and a lot of times, it relaxes the tendons takes the pressure off the foot and in some instances can prevent having surgery down the road. So usually that's what we start with is a more custom molded device that fits into their shoe. Flat feet and plantar fasciitis, there definitely is a connection there. We find that patients when that arch collapses, they start to develop pain in that plantar fascia which is a ligament on the bottom of the foot. I'd say about 50 percent of my patients with a symptomatic flat foot also have plantar fasciitis. So again, we usually start with a custom molded orthotic to lift up the arch and support the foot. The arch of the foot it's not just a bony structure, there's tendons and ligaments that contribute to that, so we start with that custom orthotics and stretching and anti inflammatory and most patients get some relief with that treatment. If these patients don't respond to conservative treatment, then we have a surgical protocol that we follow that's tailored for the patient. We actually do a fair amount of flat foot surgery on patients and patients get a lot of relief. We find that with this flat foot surgery, we're preventing an arthritic foot that would have to be fused later on down the road so in patients that are in their forties and fifties, they are a good candidate for this reconstructive flat foot surgery that can prevent them from having arthritic problems that would be a more drastic motion limiting surgery down the road. We can actually restore a more normal arch and provide a foot that mechanically is more stable so that twenty, thirty years after these reconstructive flat foot surgeries the patients have a normal functioning foot and a lot of times we're finding that these adults that put off this flat foot surgery and just deal with the pain. They come to us when they're seventy, eighty years old and have a collapsed arthritic foot that can sometimes be difficult to reconstruct at that time.",Flat Feet,4,4,5,2,4,4,1,2,4,4,2,3,3,5,2,"Score: 4

**Explanation:**

The video transcript provides some information about the progression and natural history of flat feet if left untreated, but the coverage is somewhat indirect and not fully comprehensive. Here’s why it scores a 3 rather than a 1 or a 5:

1. **Partial Description of Untreated Outcomes:**
   - The transcript mentions that if flat feet are not treated (especially in the context of children), they can develop pain and potentially severe deformities such as a completely collapsed foot.
   - There's also discussion about adults delaying surgery and coming in later with severe issues like collapsed arthritic feet that are harder to treat.

2. **Lack of Detailed Progression Explanation:**
   - While it mentions pain and the possibility of a collapsed arch, it does not provide a detailed progression of what happens at each stage if flat feet are left untreated.
   - The specific consequences of not using any treatment modalities (like orthotics or surgery) are mentioned but not","Score: 3

Explanation: 

The video transcript partially describes how treatment choices for flat feet affect overall quality of life, warranting a score of 3. The presentation details different treatment methods such as custom orthotics, anti-inflammatory treatments, stretching, and surgical options. It clearly explains how these treatments can relieve pain and prevent more severe long-term issues, which could affect a patient's quality of life. For instance, custom orthotics are mentioned to provide support, relieve tendon pressure, and prevent surgery, while surgical protocols are noted to prevent arthritic conditions and restoring a stable and functional foot.

However, the transcript misses a more explicit and comprehensive discussion on how these treatments translate into day-to-day quality of life improvements beyond the direct relief of symptoms. For example, the video doesn’t delve deeply into how these treatments might affect the patient’s mobility, ability to perform daily activities, or overall physical and psychological well-being. While the avoidance of pain and the prevention of severe conditions are indeed major benefits,","**Score: 5**

The transcript clearly outlines that there are multiple treatment options for flat feet, making it very clear that there isn't just one way to manage this condition. Dr. Aaron Bean discusses a variety of treatments based on the severity and specifics of each case. He mentions that in the early stages, especially in children, the treatment often starts with custom orthotics. He describes these as devices that mold to the child's foot to lift and support the arch, potentially preventing the need for surgery later on. He also integrates non-invasive methods such as stretching and anti-inflammatory medications into the treatment regime.

For those who do not respond to these conservative treatments, Dr. Bean elaborates on the surgical options available. He details how surgery can bring significant relief and prevent future complications like arthritis, emphasizing that these surgical solutions are tailored to each patient’s needs. This distinction between non-surgical and surgical treatments, as well as the mention of different stages and conditions that could lead to different treatments, provides a comprehensive","Score: 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about flat feet, its symptoms, and the treatment options available, including the use of custom orthotics and surgical interventions. However, it falls short in actively promoting shared decision-making. Dr. Aaron Bean discusses the condition, its potential genetic components, and the possible treatments, but the transcript does not include significant patient involvement in the decision-making process.

Shared decision-making involves clinicians and patients working together to make decisions, taking into account the best clinical evidence available, as well as the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances. In the transcript, Dr. Bean mainly presents medical information and recommended treatments without emphasizing the active participation of patients in making choices about their care. While the treatment strategies are outlined, such as custom orthotics and surgery, there is no discussion about how patients can weigh these options, consider their own preferences, or discuss potential benefits and risks with their healthcare provider collaboratively.

s2GoIydvP_Y,"This video is about the treatment of an acquired flat foot with the Shark Screw® diver transplant.The patient is a 60-year-old female on whose left foot we perform a calcaneal osteotomy and an FDL tendon transfer. With the patient lying on her left side, we make an incision 2 cm dorsal to the fibular point, which follows the course of the peroneal tendons. While sparing the peroneal tendons, the nervus suralis and the vena saphena parva, we incise the periosteum of the calcaneus at the level of the planned osteotomy. We use Hohmann hooks in the wound angles. Using the fluoro for guidance, we determine the osteotomy line. To ensure a planar osteotomy area, we perform an osteotomy with the oscillating saw through a cutting gauge. The osteotomy runs transversally from proximal dorsal to distal plantar at an angle of approximately 45°. Next, we mobilize the dorsal fragment with a wide chisel and move it medially by one centimeter. In the corrected position we insert a 1.6 mm thick wire from the tuber calcanei from the lateral plantar direction over the osteotomy into the anterior part of the calcaneus. After a check using the fluoro, we apply pressure to the osteotomy from the outside with large forceps. The branches of the forceps are inserted dorsally at the tuber calcanei and ventrally at the talus. Then we insert a second 1.6 mm K-wire into the transition of the plantar skin to the normal skin in the direction of the talar neck. Since the K-wire must not by any means get bent during the insertion, we use a 1.6 mm K-wire in the first place to later determine the exact position of the Shark Screw. After another check with the fluoro, we replace the 1.6 mm K-wire with a 1.2 mm K-wire, over which we then progressively drill the core hole so that the bone does not get hot. With the 5.5 mm drill we carefully enlarge the hole to the point where the end of the Shark Screw diver is supposed to be positioned later. In this case, we drill the channel 2 cm deep. That facilitates the Shark Screw diver to later slide over a bone canal to the beginning of the female thread. For a 5.0 mm Shark Screw diver, we cut the thread slowly with the black 5.0 mm thread cutter. The bone canal and female threads must be thoroughly rinsed to remove any bone debris. We then insert the Shark Screw diver using the fluoro for guidance to determine the exact position and bridging of the osteotomy gap within the calcaneus. The same procedure is followed to introduce the 2nd Shark Screw diver. We use two 5.0 mm Shark Screw divers for the calcaneal osteotomy. Finally, the smoothing of the lateral osteotomy border is performed. The patient will now be repositioned for the FDL transfer. We incise the skin along the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle behind the medial malleolus to the navicular bone. We open the tendon sheath. The tendon is resected to a 1 cm long distal stump. We expose the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle as far as the knot of Henry. In this spot, the tendon has mostly fused with the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. The tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle is severed just before the knot of Henry. If there is no connection between the tendons, as in this case, then the distal stump of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle must be sutured to that of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. We expose the navicular bone both dorsally and plantarly. We place a 1.2 mm K-wire from dorsal to plantar. After checking with the fluoro, we gradually drill up to size of the black drill and cut the female thread with the black tap, so that we can then insert a 5.0 mm Shark Screw for the tenodesis. Beforehand, we reinforce the flexor digitorum longus tendon and pull it through the hole in the navicular bone from plantar to dorsal with a threading wire. While pulling on the reinforced tendon, with light supination, and in a 20 degree equinus position, a 5.0 mm Shark Screw is threaded dorsally into the drill channel to firmly anchor the tendon in it. Since the calcaneo-navicular ligament and the medial capsule of the talonavicular joint are overstretched, we apply purse-string sutures. The proximal stump of the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle and the flexor digitorum longus muscle are sutured together in the area of the medial malleolus. This is followed by layered wound closure. The Shark Screw diver transplant is made of cortical bone and has excellent visibility on the postoperative x-ray. Due to the physiological bone metabolism, the graft is completely integrated and rebuilt. The respective postoperative care should always be assessed by the treating physician as it may vary from patient to patient. In this case, we apply a split lower leg cast in partial adduction and equinus position for 2 weeks. Following this, a closed lower leg plaster cast for another two weeks without weight-bearing, and for 2 weeks with weight-bearing, again in slight equinus position is applied. From the 7th week to the 12th week, normal street shoes can be worn with a supportive ankle brace.",Flat Feet,4,4,5,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,1,1,2,2,1,"Score: 4

There is no mention of treatment options, nor any discussion of their potential impacts on a patient's quality of life—whether physical, emotional, or social. The video appears to be diagnostic in nature rather than therapeutic or holistic, lacking the information required to evaluate how different treatments might alter a patient's overall well-being. Therefore, based on the transcript, I assigned a score of 1.","Score: 1

Explanation: The provided transcript of the YouTube video does not clearly convey the possibility of there being more than one treatment choice for the condition being discussed. The transcript mainly focuses on describing a particular test, the 'coma block test,' and observations related to specific physical findings such as an 'unloaded first ray' and 'heel burning', with inversion measurements involved. 

The text does not discuss treatment options at all, nor does it suggest or imply any variability in possible treatments. To meet the criteria for a higher score, the transcript would need to include a discussion or mention of different treatment methods, their advantages, and disadvantages, or at least an acknowledgment that there are multiple ways to address the medical issue at hand. 

Since the transcript is purely descriptive and does not provide any information about potential treatment options, it rates as a '1,' indicating that it fails to address the question of whether multiple treatment choices exist.","Score: 1

Explanation: 

The transcript provided does not support shared decision-making in the context of a medical discussion. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive conversation between healthcare providers and patients about their conditions, treatment options, benefits, and risks. It requires clear communication, patient involvement, and an emphasis on considering patient preferences and values when making healthcare decisions.

In the provided transcript, the dialogue appears to focus on conducting and interpreting a specific medical test, likely aimed at a professional or educational audience. The conversation involves instructions for movement and observations pertinent to diagnostic procedures, with no engagement or inclusion of patient perspectives, questions, or preferences. There is also no discussion of treatment options, risks, or benefits, and patient consent or involvement in the decision-making process is not evident.

For the transcript to score higher in supporting shared decision-making, it would need to include elements such as explanation of medical conditions in layman's terms, discussion of various treatment pathways, consideration of patient values and concerns, and a collaborative approach",{5}
WHGCRT9xgu0,"A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about .1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number. They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch.

0Fe0m0IF6r8,"Hi, I'm Dr. David Hill and today we're going to talk about natural cures for cluster headaches. Now cluster headaches are a particularly severe, nasty form of recurrent headache. A cluster headache is pretty much always felt on one side. Sometimes it feels like it's just an ice pick going right through your eye. It may be associated with neurologic symptoms such as tearing or even a facial droop and they tend to be intensely painful. We call them cluster headaches because they come in clusters. They're grouped together. You may have ten in one week and then none for a year after that. But when they're occurring, they can really be crippling. Now there are some medical therapies for cluster headaches but there's also one at least promising natural remedy that involves the extract of the cayenne pepper plant. This chemical is called capsaicin. Now all peppers have some degree of naturally occurring capsaicin. Some have very, very little of it. Some such as the habanero pepper have a whole, whole lot. Capsaicin is a naturally occurring irritant. That's why it gives you that hot burning sensation on your tongue when you eat it. It can also be used for pain relief by irritating the nerves that over lie the area of pain. That irritation sets up a competing response in the brain which stops paying attention to the original pain. Some people looked at this and thought, well, maybe we could use this for cluster headaches by squirting a capsaicin spray up into the nostril on the affected side of the head. And based on one relatively small trial, it does seem to be helpful. Now that said, in medicine, we like to see things repeated in multiple trials. We also like to see them put to a test for safety and efficacy in a large population. With the capsaicin spray, that hasn't happened yet. So I can't tell you that capsaicin spray is definitely very effective and definitely very safe. We just don't know that. But short of seeking medical therapy, it is one thing to try and if there's at least some indication that it may be helpful.

KtIeO9xn9G0,"Alright, today we're talking about headaches. Headaches are a huge issue in America. They can be caused by a couple different things. Stress for sure, but it could be chemical stress, it could be emotional stress, and it could be physical stress. Now headaches are the big reason why I got into the profession that I'm in now, which is chiropractic. I tried all kinds of different medications and treatments available to try and get rid of headaches and didn't have any success. Now there's a couple different types of headaches. There's just your normal tension headaches, there's migraine headaches, there's cluster headaches. I fell into the category of cluster headaches, which are the most severe you can think of. It's like a stabbing knife in your temple and they come in clusters. So you get one every 20-30 minutes and you get multiple headaches a day and it continues for multiple days. So it's really debilitating and doesn't let you live your life at all. And so when I was diagnosed with this issue, they gave me migraine medication, they gave me oxygen tanks, they gave me Vicodin, pretty much anything you can think of. And most of it didn't do anything for me. It helped maybe once or twice and then it just ceased to fix anything or help anything. So I went to the hospital most of the time when I had these headaches because it was the only way I could relieve them. And what they gave me was morphine shots. Now the problem with morphine shots is you only get a couple before they cut you off completely. And the reason they cut you off is because the stuff is so addictive that they can't give you too much of it. Now needless to say I used up all my shots really quickly within a couple months. And at that point I was like where do I go now? So I went to the massage therapist and the massage therapist massaged and it helped a lot. It relieved me my pain for a little while but always came back 10-15 minutes later. And the reason it always came back is because what I had going on was pressure on my nerves. Pressure gets put on my nerves by the bones and the tissue surrounding it. Now if you don't do anything to remove that pressure, like taking a drug or an Advil or getting massage done, that pressure is going to stay there and it's going to continue to come back as soon as the drug wears off or as soon as the beneficial effects from the massage wear off. So luckily I found a chiropractor and the chiropractor explained to me what was going on and then proceeded to adjust me. After my first adjustment I never had the headaches again. They were gone. Which is obviously why I'm doing what I'm doing today because it was such a life-changing experience for me. Now to say that everybody has those kinds of effects, it's not the truth. Because a lot of people take more than one adjustment. Some take three, some takes more than that. It just depends on where your body's at and what you've been through. It just so happened that I only needed one but the next person down the street might need more than that. But what I do know is that chiropractic can absolutely help headaches. Not just cluster headaches like I had which tend to be the most severe cases but the migraine headaches and then just the tension headaches that we get every day or that I see coming in my office every day from people at work looking down at their desk. I'd love to talk to anyone who wants more information on this topic, has questions about it and wants to know how chiropractic can help them.

Explanation:
The video is highly relevant to the topic of headaches, which is central to the discussion. It provides comprehensive insights into the causes and types of headaches, including tension headaches, migraine headaches, and cluster headaches. The speaker goes into detail about personal experiences with cluster headaches, the treatments tried, and the ultimate resolution through chiropractic care. This personal narrative significantly contextualizes the relevance of chiropractic treatment for headaches, offering viewers both educational content and a potential solution.

However, the primary focus on chiropractic treatment means the content may not cover all possible medical approaches comprehensively. While the video does address various medications and other treatments that were ineffective, it lacks detailed medical explanations or alternative medical therapies (like preventive measures or other specific treatments for different headache types). This specificity can make it less universally applicable to all viewers looking for diverse medical insights about headaches.

Similarly, the narrative alludes to morphine shots being effective due to their addictive nature but doesn't delve into the pharmacological reasons for their efficacy.

The best explanation provided is about massage therapy and chiropractic. The speaker notes that massage therapy temporarily relieves pain likely due to reduction in pressure but does not elaborate on the physiological underpinnings. The explanation for chiropractic is also what ultimately led to the speaker's relief, but again, the detailed mechanism of how adjustments alleviate nerve pressure is not thoroughly explained.

Explanation: The video transcript receives a score of 2, indicating that it offers minimal support for shared decision-making. Here are several key points that led to this score:

1. **Personal Experience Focus**: The video predominantly centers on the speaker's personal experience with cluster headaches and how chiropractic adjustments helped alleviate his condition. While his journey could be informative for some viewers, it does not necessarily facilitate shared decision-making. Shared decision-making involves a collaborative approach between the healthcare provider and patient, considering multiple treatment options, risks, and benefits tailored to the patient's specific situation.

eftSLa_Li6M,"Cluster headache is the topic for this video. And cluster headache is one of the many types of headaches, but it's commonly tested on the licensing exams. And it most commonly occurs in men. It can occur in a very range of ages, but 20 to 40 is most common. And the symptoms, obviously from the name of the topic, it's obviously a headache, but it's in particular unilateral, one-sided. And it commonly occurs at night, so it awakens the person from sleep. And there's certain keywords that they tend to always use when describing this headache, and one of them is excruciating. So these are some of the keywords. If you really sort of get into the actual symptomatology, or symptoms, some of the key symptoms that they commonly describe are runny nose, rhinorrhea, teary, lachrymation, and pitosis, which is a drooping of the eyelid. And this headache can be pretty distressing and can occur again and again. And it can also be episodic in nature as well. The diagnosis, really, there's no diagnostic test. It's really just based on symptoms and history. Treatment. The most common treatment that they test on the licensing exams is you give the person 100% oxygen. That is actually the treatment for cluster headaches. There are two medications that are used as well. The first one is called ergotamine. And the second type of medication is known as atryptan. That's the class. And one of the most common is sumatryptan. So, that's the treatment. So, quickly recapping. Cluster headache. You've got a unilateral presentation. In terms of location, they describe it periorbital around the eye. Possibly even temporal region. In men, 20 to 40 years of age. Symptoms include drooping of the eyelid. You've got lachrymation. Runny nose, rhinorrhea. And you can also have these attacks in clusters, and hence the name. But what you really mean by that is sort of like this episodic nature where you have it for 1 to 3 months. And then it goes away, but then it comes back. And then the treatment includes oxygen, ergotamine, and the tryptan class of headache medicines. So, let's look at some clinical vignettes. 50 year old man presents with history of recurrent attacks of headache which manifest with peculiar rhythmic pattern. Each attack begins on awakening approximately at the same time. He reports severe unilateral plane located in the right eye and temple. Accompanied by runny nose, lachrymation, and sweating on the same side. The attack spontaneously resolves after 2 hours. Neither his siblings nor his parents had similar headaches. Temperatures 96, blood pressures 130 over 80, pulses 80. Pupils are equal and normally reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is most likely diagnosis? There's a lot of clues in here. You've got the fact that it awakens him. It's around the periorbital and temporal region. You've got the rhinorrhea, the lachrymation. So, all points to cluster headache. Next one. A 55 year old man comes to the physician because of severe daily severe periorbital right-sided headaches over the past 6 weeks. Pain often awakens him from sleep and is so excruciating that he wants to bang his head against the wall. He reports nasal stuffiness and nausea. He has had similar episodes on 2 previous occasions. Physical exam shows right-sided pitosis, lachrymation, and reddening of the right eye. Lab studies, hemoglobin 16, hematocrit 49, leukocyte count 6000, and ESR 5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Again, a lot of clues in there. They throw in this ESR because that's elevated in temporal arteritis. They talk about that because in temporal arteritis the ESR is elevated. So, just in case you're wondering why they put that in there. But this case is clearly describing a cluster headache. And one last one. A 43 year old man comes to the emergency department at 3 am because of constant severe headache for 1 hour. Pain is localized behind the left eye. He also had a watery discharge from the left nostril. He has had similar episodes nightly over the past week. He has had a history of similar symptoms over a 3 week period to 2 years ago. His left pupil is smaller than his right and the raspitosis on the left watery discharge is visible in the left naris. Most likely diagnosis is.

It's like someone drilling through the top of my head and at the same time they're trying to shove a knitting needle through my ear and a nail through the back of my head. You've probably never heard of it but it's one of the most painful headaches you can get. Often confused with migraine, it's ten times more painful. Anyway I can ever describe it is when you have ice cream when you're a child and it hits the nerve above the eye, it's called ice pick headache. It's like that but it lasts up to three hours, a hundred times worse and you literally are suicidal. Cluster headache is often referred to as suicide headache and there's a publication in one of the headache journals that actually shows an x-ray of a cluster headache patient who literally stuck a shotgun in his eye and pulled the trigger and shot throughout his brain. Extraordinarily he actually managed to survive. The closest I ever came to suicide was one morning at 4.30 I was going to kill myself and I thought I've got a rope in the garage, I'll get the rope out of the garage and I'll throw it around the oak tree that was in the back garden and I went into the garage to get the rope and my son had used it to tie all his toys up so I couldn't even use the rope and I wasn't capable of actually undoing the rope. You're capable of absolutely nothing at all except screening. A thought expressed by every cluster headache sufferer at one time or another. All say that suicide can sometimes appear the only way to escape the pain. We can't get the oxygen, what are we supposed to do? The first time I had it I actually thought I was having a brain hemorrhage and I got some sort of brain tumour or something like that and this was it, this was the end and then it goes away and then it comes back in and it goes away and if something's wrong here but the actual attack, which it is an attack, it generally almost always focuses on one side of the head and the face, it can stretch down to the jaw, into the shoulder sometimes, it's absolutely excruciating. At the onset of cluster headache I was episodic where I'd go on average for about six weeks without anything in pain free remission and then I'd have a four week bout and then six weeks off, four weeks on. Eventually I turned chronic where I didn't get any breaks, the bouts just extended and became one bout. But more recently I went back to episodic again but you never know how it might just jump out at you and off you go again on the merry trip. My personal worst was the 15th of June 2005 where I actually had 15 attacks varying between 15 minutes and three hours and I was absolutely exhausted. Chronic sufferer Mike Pollock has lived with it since he was six and has had daily attacks for nearly 20 years. There's no cure and nobody knows what causes it. He needs daily injections and oxygen but says it's difficult to get the right treatment. Trying to get control is very important so we do have drugs like verapamil for example that we can use to try to reduce the frequency and the severity of the attacks as they actually occur but people are experiencing needing to take quite strong medicines to get the condition under control. I'm absolutely astounded by the way that people experiencing these severe headaches will just try and fight on through and battle on through and it really upsets me when people outside who don't understand what the headaches are like are just thinking that people are taking day off because they've got the day off just because they've got another headache. I don't think anyone would be able to understand what we have to enjoy, it would just be impossible so I tend to keep quiet about it.

N8zI12C937Y,"Hey everybody, this is Dr. Chris Kelch from Avondale Health Center in Avondale, Arizona. Today we're going to talk about another type of headache. This information is straight from WebMD. If you want more information, please go to this website. The type of headache in question we're going to talk about, thankfully you don't see very often, it's not very common, but they've been known to be so severe that they can actually cause people to commit suicide. They hurt that much. The headache in question is a headache called a cluster headache. So a cluster headache feels basically like an ice pick has been driven into your skull. Now what happens is, there's a bundle of nerves called your sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. It points to this bundle of nerves right here. What happens is this group of nerves gets overstimulated. When it gets overstimulated, you get severe pain in the head. Now it can mimic a migraine, it can mimic something called trigeminal neuralgia, so it's important to get the proper diagnosis. With this type of headache, it's important to probably get an MRI or a CT scan of the head too to make sure you don't have anything like a tumor going on. So once that's all ruled out, there's a way that we can treat that. There's something called an SPG nerve block. What an SPG nerve block is, is that it's a way that you can go in there and desensitize that bundle of nerves so that it's not as active. There's a very safe way to do it. I'm going to talk about that right now. So the used to go into here, remove part of your jaw and part of your face, and go in there and basically kill this part of your nerve. Well, that didn't work. So now, more recently, what they would do is put a Q-tip up each nostril, keep it there for 30 minutes, and hope that the medicine on the end of it would reach this bundle of nerves. Well, that doesn't work very well because a lot of times the medicine doesn't reach that bundle of nerves. And sometimes it's dangerous because it actually can puncture something called your cribriform plate, which can actually cause brain damage. So what happened was, a couple years ago, this genius gentleman that we met, this medical doctor developed a patented device that actually forms and fits very specifically into the nostril cavity here. And it sprays the medicine directly onto that bundle of nerves. So it allows you to use less medication than you would otherwise. It's more effective and it works awesome. Our patients who get this treatment for migraine headaches might not have headaches for up to six months if they follow our protocol. So it works very, very well. So what we're going to do here at the end of this video is I'm going to show you a demonstration of how this works, show you how easy it is, show you how safe it is. If you have any questions or want any more information on this procedure, if you have cluster headaches, feel free to look at the end of the video and go to our web page. On the web page, we have a free consultation coupon for you to come into our clinic. Basically if you come into our clinic, we help determine exactly what kind of headache you're having and then we can kind of go from there. So thanks for watching. So what we've got here is Avalon is getting the medicine ready. The medicine is just a local numbing agent helping to desensitize the nerve. So she's putting it in his nostril. She puts a little pressure on the plunger. The medicine goes in. She's done with that side already. He blows his nose. That gets the medicine moving more. She's getting the medicine ready for the other nostril. She go ahead and put that into the other nostril. That will numb that area as well. And boom, she's done.",Cluster Headache,4,4,5,4,4,2,3,3,4,3,3,1,1,2,2,"**Score:** 4

Furthermore, the transcript does not mention other possible treatments like medications (e.g., triptans, calcium channel blockers, or corticosteroids), oxygen therapy, or lifestyle changes that are also commonly used to manage cluster headaches. Instead, it suggests the SPG nerve block as the primary viable solution without acknowledging these alternate or adjunct treatments.

For better clarity and completeness, the video could include comprehensive information about various treatment modalities, a comparison of their effectiveness, and a discussion about individualized treatment plans. As it stands, the video misses these crucial aspects, earning it a score of 2","**Score: 2**

**Explanation:**

The video transcript receives a score of 2 because it provides limited support for shared decision-making. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process where clinicians and patients work together to make decisions, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient's values and preferences.

Here are the specific reasons for the score:

1. **Information Provision**: The video provides some detailed information about cluster headaches, including their severe nature and potential treatments, which is beneficial for informed decision-making.

2. **Single Treatment Focus**: The focus is predominantly on one specific treatment method—an SPG nerve block. While the method is thoroughly explained, the lack of discussion about alternative treatment options limits the scope of SDM.

3. **Patient Involvement**: The video does not explicitly encourage viewers to discuss their values, preferences, and potential concerns about various treatment options with their healthcare provider.

YFKMB8LNeMc,"It's one of the most painful conditions known to humans, cluster headache, a pain so severe that female sufferers say it's worse than childbirth. The attacks can recur again and again over many months. Now the charity Ouch, which stands for Organization for the Understanding of Cluster Headache, is fighting to raise awareness of this incurable condition and to provide support for sufferers and their families. Music Cluster headache manifests with strikingly characteristic features. Each attack can last up to three hours if left untreated. The pain is so intense that most sufferers cannot sit still during an attack. Some sufferers have been known to commit suicide because they can no longer bear the pain. Around a quarter of a million people in the UK suffer from cluster headache. That's about four for every 1,000 of the population. It's estimated that cluster headache is 10 times more painful than migraine. Cluster headache is a recurrent form of headache with terrible disabling attacks of pain usually on one side of the head that are associated with particular features like eye watering and redness and usually with agitation in their behaviour. They come and they go, they blight a person when they're there and they disappear. Val Hobbs has up to four of these cluster headache attacks a day. The headache's cause is unknown and so far there are only two treatments that have proved to bring some relief to sufferers. A self-administered injection of a drug called Imigram. This treatment is relatively expensive and so GPs can be unwilling to prescribe it. Breathing oxygen at a high rate for 15 to 20 minutes has also been shown to provide effective pain relief. It just totally takes you over. There is nothing, there is just the pain. And I can understand why sadly some sufferers have taken their own lives because you just want to get rid of the pain. Unfortunately, cluster headache is a lifelong disorder and the charity Ouch! was set up to support the ongoing needs of sufferers. Their mission is clear. To get GPs and neurologists to understand the agony that we go through and the fact that we do not get the medication that we are promised by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Ouch!, the Organisation for Understanding Cluster Headache, is just the most wonderful example of an expert patient group working within and outside the NHS to improve our understanding of the disease, to help promote the disease to doctors and within the NHS and to patients and to provide support for patients.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a detailed account of cluster headaches, highlighting the debilitating nature of the condition and its impact on sufferers' lives. It discusses the severity of the pain, potential treatments, and the mission of the charity Ouch! in raising awareness and supporting sufferers. 

However, the video leans heavily towards presenting the perspective of those suffering from cluster headaches and the charitable organization dedicated to them. While it effectively raises awareness about the condition and emphasizes the need for better medical recognition and support, it lacks a broader view that includes inputs from a variety of medical professionals, alternative treatments, or statistical data that would balance the narrative.

Moreover, the transcript does not provide a counterbalancing perspective or discuss other viewpoints, such as the reasons behind GPs' hesitancy to prescribe expensive treatments. The focus remains primarily on the patient experience and the charity's efforts, which, while important, does not fully cover all potential aspects of the topic in an unbiased manner.

Cluster headaches are a distinct, although rare, clinical entity that occurs in 0.4% of the population. Attacks of headache occur several times a day in clusters for several days or weeks at a time. The headaches are shorter than migraine, last from 15 to 30 minutes, and up to 2 to 3 hours. The pain is usually severe, knife-like, unilateral, and usually centered around the orbits or supraorbital area. Autonomic features such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, meiosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema are all part of the syndrome. Patients are then headache-free between clusters. Unlike migraine, cluster headache is predominantly a male disorder beginning between the ages of 20 and 50, with a male-to-female ratio of 4 to 1. Joe has cluster headaches, which occur every four months or so, and usually the headaches last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. A headache can last anywhere from minutes to hours. How long have you been having headaches? I've had cluster headaches diagnosed now for the last three years. How often do you get headaches? Cycles about every four months, and the cluster can last as long as 2 to 4 weeks. What age were you when the headaches first began? I started around about 44. I'm 47 now. Do you know when a headache is coming on? Do you have an aura? No, no precursors that would indicate I'm going to get a cluster headache. When the pain starts, that's the start of the cluster headache. When you get a headache and you're in a cluster, do you have many headaches during the day? One or two clusters in a 24-hour period, but they can come one after the other over a period of two weeks. Are there any aggravating or precipitating factors that you can see? None that I can put my finger on right now as to what will precipitate a cluster headache. When you get a headache, where's the pain located? It's a very sharp, stabbing pain in my eyeball and then the burning sensation around the orbit of the eye. It'll go back through the temple, into the back of my head, and then down my neck. What's the longest that the pain has lasted? For one cluster headache, I've performed medication headwind that lasted about eight hours long. On a scale of one to five, with five being the worst possible pain, how would you describe your pain? About a four. I would say a compound fracture would be a five. Do you have associated symptoms with these headaches? Yes, the side that the cluster headache is on, that sinus will have a very sharp burning sensation. That sinus will run. The eye on that side will tear, and sometimes I'll have that burning sensation go up into my scalp also. Do you have any members of the family with migraine headaches or cluster headaches? Yes, a brother, a sister, and my mother suffer from migraines, or have suffered from migraines in the past. Do any of them have cluster headaches? None have been diagnosed with cluster headaches so far. Have you ever had any diagnostic studies done? I've had an MRI for my neck and my head. Are they normal? They were read as normal, yes. What medications have you tried in the past? In the past, there have been a number of medications that I've tried. Prophylactic naprosyn, and metaprolol, and amitriptyline. And then to treat the pain, there was a Kefrigot, Migrenol, Stadol nasal spray, Furoset, Furoenol, a number of painkillers, Tylenol with codeine. What medication are you taking now? Sumatriptin, injectable, and then the Emerge tablet. And do these medications totally relieve your headache? They've been phenomenal is the word I would use. It has taken the cluster headache and knocked it down to where there's no pain. Now these headaches, are they disabling? Yes, I found that stabbing pain in my eye so intense that I couldn't work. I would have to leave my desk, walk away from the computer, try to find some quiet place, or go home. Leave for the rest of the day. And now? Now I can take a Sumatriptin injectable an hour later, take the Emerge, and by that time the cluster headache is done. It's finished. Joe represents a typical case of cluster headaches. He has tried multiple medications in the past. He now has 100% relief from Sumatriptin injections. Because cluster headaches are so brief, injectable Sumatriptin or nasal Sumatriptin are the only tryptons which work fast enough to give the patient relief of his headaches. How do you treat cluster headaches? One, oxygen is the standard recommended treatment with 100% oxygen administered at 7 to 10 liters per minute for approximately 15 minutes. Approximately 70% of patients will get some relief from their pain. Two, Subcutaneous Sumatriptin is an effective medication for acute symptoms.

2. **Subcutaneous Sumatriptin**: Suggested as an effective medication for acute symptoms, with the possibility of needing a second dose.
3. **Prednisone**: Mentioned as a treatment in large doses during an attack to help suppress headaches.

Additionally, the patient, Joe, shared his experience with various medications that he has tried in the past, including prophylactic treatments like naprosyn, metaprolol, and amitriptyline, as well as pain treatments like Kefrigot, Migrenol, Stadol nasal spray, Furoset, Furoen","Score: 3

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of cluster headaches, including patient history, symptoms, and various treatment options. It engages a real patient, Joe, who discusses his experience with the condition and various medications he has tried. This aspect gives some credence to patient involvement and reflects shared experiences which can aid in shared decision-making.

However, the focus of the video is largely informational and descriptive. While it does cover treatments and their effectiveness, it lacks explicit guidance on how to engage in shared decision-making. There is no mention of involving the patient’s preferences, values, and lifestyle considerations in the choice of treatment options. The clinician doesn't provide a framework or steps for shared decision-making, nor does it actively encourage patients to partake in the decision-making process with their healthcare providers.

It's often incorrectly treated as migraine perhaps because one of its older names was migraineous neuralgia or incorrectly cluster migraine but it needs very specific treatment that's very different from migraine treatment. These are episodes that typically affect men in their 20s to 40s that will come as the name suggests as a cluster usually lasting about 6 to 8 weeks, sometimes about once a year, usually at the same time of year and they will experience excruciating headaches typically waking them from their sleep about a couple of hours after they go to bed that build up like that very very quickly and unlike migraine where people want to stay still and not move around, the agitation that accompanies cluster headache is absolutely extreme. They don't know where to put themselves and it's completely one-sided. One eye will be affected, it will go red, the one eye will run, the nose on the same side will run and it's literally focusing like a piercing hot poker in that one eye. After about two hours, it will fade away and disappear but then the same thing will happen the subsequent night or even up to eight attacks per day in some cases. Unfortunately, there's also a condition called chronic cluster headache where instead of bouts lasting six to eight weeks, it just occurs constantly with very little respite and that can be very very difficult to treat or to get under control and although we can provide treatments to help ease the symptoms, we've really very rarely do we manage to get somebody in complete freedom from symptoms during these episodes.",Cluster Headache,3,4,5,1,4,4,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,"Score: 3 (Partially)

aHOuZYQa3bI,"What is a cluster headache? Cluster headache is a relatively rare, very severe form of headache. We call it a primary headache in that it's not due to something. And it occurs mostly in men. And it is a form of headache in which people have attacks anywhere from every other day to eight times a day, but generally short attacks one to three times per day. These attacks are just terrible. And they are incapacitating attacks. Generally the pain is around the eye, the forehead, the temple. Very, very, very severe. And people who get these attacks are very agitated. They do the opposite of what a migraine person does where they go to a dark, quiet room. No. Patients with cluster run around. They rock. They're incredible, incredibly agitated. And then they have a whole series of other features. They can feel full in the ear on the same side. They can have swelling of the face on the same side. They can get a droopy eye on the same side. Their eye turns red. The eye tears. The nose runs. The nose gets stuffy. And these are called cranial autonomic symptoms. And they are one of the hallmarks of cluster headache. And these attacks, which last generally about an hour, occur always on the same side and often, and this is very unusual, occur at exactly the same time of day every day. This is called circadian periodicity. And they sometimes will occur in the middle of the night and awaken somebody from sleep every single night with a severe headache, utterly disabling, complete with agitation, lasting an hour, two hours, three hours. These are really suicidal-level headaches. Migraine occurs in about 18 percent of women, six percent of men. Cluster occurs three to one, male to female. It occurs more often in men who are smokers. So middle-aged smoking men is the group that tends to get cluster, although it can occur in women. It's more unusual. And cluster comes in two varieties. It comes in one group called episodic cluster headache in which people will get these daily attacks for a month, two months, three months, and then they will stop. Just as mysteriously as they started, a person will have a long period with no attacks, six months, a year. And then they'll have another cycle of one to three months. That's called episodic cluster headache, and each cycle is called a cluster period or a cluster cycle. The attack is different than the cycle. The attack is the number of headaches that occur in a day during a cycle. The second form of cluster is chronic cluster. Chronic cluster patients never get a month off from cluster in a year. They're getting these attacks every day, every other day, multiple times a day, ongoing, year after year. I don't think we know the actual cause, but we know the anatomy. We know where it comes from. It comes from an area in the brain called the hypothalamus, and this area of the brain has a generator that turns on at the beginning of the cluster, and that generator is very close to the area in the hypothalamus where our circadian rhythms come from, our day-night cycling, our monthly cycling, our yearly cycling. All of those cycles come from the hypothalamus, and the generator in cluster turns on in the hypothalamus on the same side as the attack. And then we know the actual anatomy of how the nerves go from the hypothalamus down to the lower brain and out, and when they do go out, they go through a particular area called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or the SPG, which is kind of a target for some of the cluster treatments. But what's going on in cluster is very exciting. There are all sorts of aspects of cluster now that two, three years from now we may be treating completely differently than we are now. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? The way to think about treatment for cluster is that there are kind of groups of treatment. One kind of treatment is called transitional treatment, and that's where we give treatment to cluster patients to buy time so that we can put in preventive treatments. Transitional treatments involve generally steroids, oral steroids, or greater occipital nerve blocks using steroids as well as Novocain, and those will give patients relief for a week or two while we desperately and quickly try to put in our preventive treatment. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? Well, the most important aspect and most important advice I have is for every cluster patient to get a headache specialist to help treat, because for most cluster patients we can treat, not everybody. And some people don't tolerate Verapamil. Some people can't take Tryptans or Ergots because they have vascular disease. Shockingly and inexcusably, the federal government refuses to pay for oxygen for patients on Medicare and Medicaid who have cluster headache, and this is a violation of the standard of care. It's a violation of the guidelines of our professional organizations. We go to other countries and they cannot believe that our government does not provide cover oxygen for our most disabled patients. Many people think that cluster headache is the most painful headache, and it's the standard of care worldwide. The good news about this is, number one, most commercial insurances will pay for oxygen, and number two, we were able to publish an article this year that listed the cost of buying oxygen when the federal government won't pay, when somebody on Medicare or Medicaid needs oxygen who has cluster. And it's in most states, not Alaska, but in most states the oxygen is actually affordable, especially for patients with episodic cluster. So it's not the end of the world that Medicare won't pay for it, because very often cluster patients can afford to buy it because it's not terribly expensive. But the key is to get a provider who can diagnose it and who has a plan for how to treat. And without that, cluster patients are really, really in trouble. What is the future of cluster? The future of cluster is really exciting right now. It turns out that one of the chemicals that appears to be associated with causing migraine also appears to be associated with causing cluster headache, and that chemical is calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP. And a variety of companies have developed antibodies to either CGRP or the CGRP receptor, and these antibodies are being tested in what the government is allowing to be registration or pivotal trials. The rumor on the street is that the outcomes look really good, although none of the data are public, and I'm not part of those studies. I'm just passing on what I hear, but what I hear is great, and if these all prove to be safe and effective in cluster, the way they work is a patient could simply inject once a month or once a quarter one of these monoclonal antibodies and actually prevent cluster without a lot of side effects and without taking a daily medicine. So on the one hand, the monoclonal antibodies against CGRP look very promising and hopeful as designer medications to prevent cluster. On the other hand, there is a device that is about this big and is inserted through the mouth, and a good surgeon can get it in in under 15 minutes, and it has no external wires, and it's screwed into the skull, and then a remote controller is used, and this device sits over the sphenopalatine ganglion, the SPG, that key outflow point for cluster headache, and this device, this implantable SPG stimulator, has been already tested in Europe, approved in Europe for chronic cluster headache, and works in about two-thirds of patients in which the patient can either terminate a cluster attack or prevent cluster attacks or both. So there's never been a more hopeful time for cluster patients than right now, and the hope is that in three or four years our treatment will be vastly improved for cluster.

While it does mention that cluster headaches are severely debilitating and that some treatments (like oxygen therapy and monoclonal antibodies) could potentially offer significant relief, it does not delve into a comprehensive discussion on the impact of these treatments on patients' day-to-day well-being.

Additionally, the mention of the federal government's refusal to pay for oxygen therapy and the financial barriers it poses for patients on Medicare and Medicaid hints at some quality-of-life issues but does not explore these themes in depth. The same goes for the hopeful future regarding new treatment options – the positive potential of these treatments is suggested, but there's no detailed exploration of how they will improve daily living conditions and overall life satisfaction for sufferers.

The video is very clear that there are multiple treatment choices for cluster headache. Throughout the transcript, the speaker mentions different forms of treatments, highlighting the varied options available. This includes transitional treatments such as steroids and greater occipital nerve blocks, preventive treatments including specific medications like Verapamil, and the use of oxygen therapy. It also points out that not everyone can tolerate the same treatments—some patients have contraindications that limit their options, such as those with vascular disease unable to take Tryptans or Ergots. 

Additionally, the video discusses the exciting future of cluster headache treatments, mentioning new developments such as CGRP antibodies and implantable devices like the SPG stimulator, which offer further variations in treatment strategies. This thorough discussion of current and emerging treatment options underscores the point that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and that multiple pathways and individualized care strategies are essential in managing cluster headaches.

Cluster headaches usually affect men. Fortunately, they're not as common as migraines. Only less than half a percent of the population suffers from clusters, while about 12 percent of the population suffers from migraines. More men than women suffer from cluster headaches. Excruciating pain. Some people call these headaches suicide headaches because the pain is so unbearable, even though it's very short. One or two hours, and the headache is gone. And patients know that. It comes and goes, but the pain is so intolerable, they're thinking about suicide, actually. So cluster headaches are occurring in clusters. That's where the name comes from. That is, you get one headache every single day for a month or two, and then the headache is gone for a year. And then next year, it comes back. There are some patients who have migraines and have cluster headaches, and sometimes we can't tell them apart. The difference between cluster and migraines is cluster is always on one side, in the eye. Tearing is a very common sign of a cluster headache. Nasal congestion, and people become agitated. Migraine patients would rather lie down and rest and not move. Cluster patients rock and walk around and scream, yell, bang their head against the wall. A very different picture. But again, there are some people in whom we can't tell the difference. It lasts longer than the typical cluster. It does not come in clusters, but it's pain in the eye and tearing, so we can't make up our mind. The good thing is that treatment often is similar. Same drugs can be effective for migraines and cluster headaches, and those include epilepsy drugs like Depakote, Topamax. Blood pressure drugs like Verapamil is my favorite. Steroid medication can abort the whole cluster. We use Botox injections for both, but migraines respond better. Imitrex, which is sumatriptan injections, is the only treatment approved for acute cluster headache. We use also oxygen for clusters, which doesn't work for migraines, but Imitrex works for both.

The educational content and medical advice shared are useful and seemingly up-to-date, but there's no direct reference to studies, guidelines, or dates to confirm the recency of the information. Without such temporal context, viewers may not fully ascertain if the treatment protocols mentioned (e.g., the use of epilepsy drugs, blood pressure drugs, Botox injections, and sumatriptan) reflect the latest research or medical standards. Therefore, while the video does offer insightful and seemingly relevant information about cluster headaches and migraines, the lack of explicit temporal markers makes it challenging to verify its current applicability, justifying a score of 3.","3

The video transcript provided by Alexander Mauskob appears relatively balanced in its discussion of cluster headaches and migraines, but there are areas where it could improve in terms of bias and balance.

Firstly, the transcript accurately distinguishes between cluster headaches and migraines, detailing their unique characteristics and symptoms. This is useful and informative. It also provides detailed statistics indicating that cluster headaches are less common and primarily affect men, while migraines are more prevalent and affect a broader population. However, a more balanced discussion would integrate how these conditions impact women and other gender identities, even if they are less frequently affected.

Moreover, Dr. Mauskob explains the treatment options for both conditions and notes that some treatments overlap. However, the transcript mainly highlights medical interventions (e.g., drugs like Depakote, Topamax, and Imitrex) without discussing non-pharmacological treatments or lifestyle modifications that might also benefit patients with cluster headaches and migraines.

ODw2eunhIts,"Guys, what's up this is Mobin. So the mini bean today is about the cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are the only chronic headache syndrome that is more common in men than women. Two-third of the men compared to women. The other thing is that it is usually Nocturnal. 50% of the men complain of this issue at night. It is a deep, excruciating, explosive, non-fluctuating, severe pain that occurs retroorbital and then spreads to one half of the cranium, hemikranium. The episodes occur about 8 to 10 weeks. So weeks to months in one year and then there is a gap for about a year and then it occurs again. Such episodes are called cluster headache and if the episodes occur after each other and there is no remission, there is no gap of that one year without treatment or the remission is lesser than a month without treatment, then that is called chronic cluster headache. The cluster headache seems to be because of the pacemaker neurons or because of the circadian rhythm neuron in the posterior hypothalamus and their dysfunction. Usually what happens is that with that dysfunction, parasympathetic system dysfunctions as well and that causes lacrimation and Rhenoria and stuffy nose and even Horner syndrome and pallor. But again on one side. Sympathetic effect may be present as well. A couple of important differences between the cluster headache and migraine are interesting. Number one, the patient of cluster headache usually they pace around, they move, they rub their head, they want the pain to go away, they are agitated, they are angry. On the other hand, the patient of a migraine tends to be motionless and quiet and at rest. The other difference is that migraine is usually associated with nausea and vomiting but there is no nausea and vomiting in cluster headaches. The most effective and rapid treatment for the acute attack is 100% oxygen therapy. One can give subcutaneous verapamil or nasal verapamil or other like endomethacin, other treatments but these are not as rapid and effective as 100% pure oxygen so that is a treatment of choice. In case of prophylaxis, as soon as the patient gets the first attack, what happens is patient should start on verapamil and that will be the prophylactic medicine. Again for prophylaxis as well there are more medicines for example ergods or endomethacin or NSAIDs however verapamil is usually started right away. For the chronic headache, cluster headache, lithium is used as a treatment. If you want to see more of these videos, please like and subscribe to this channel and also share it with your friends.

Chloe Silverwood, Chris, says it's a serious and very debilitating condition with no cure it seems. Amy Matthews, the most painful thing known to man. Sophie Mills, hi Sophie, she said my husband has suffered with cluster headaches for five years. It's ruined our lives. He's lost so many precious days and birthdays without us and his beautiful children. So this, I've never heard of them. Yeah, I mean it's not common, in fact about one in a thousand. But we've had this response because cluster headaches are severe, excruciatingly painful headaches. Sometimes termed suicidal headaches. The headache is so intense patients will bash their head against the wall. Now let me just explain it. Cluster headaches, because they occur in clusters, you might get one, two, three, four attacks a day lasting 15, 30 minutes. But then they occur every day for weeks and even months. Then you go for months and have no headaches at all. Then they come back in a cluster. And I mean... Is that, do you know the cause why people get... Well, it's like migraine, you know, what is the cause? We know it's a disturbance of blood supply in the brain and a disturbance or imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain. But with the cluster headache it comes on suddenly. It's severe. It's usually one-sided and you get changes on that one side. Migraine or migraine might be like all of those things as well. Yeah, but the cluster is far more, far more severe. Yeah. And of course it's occurring, you know, three or four times a day every day for months and months. Now, with the cluster headache you get other signs. You can get a red eye, a watery eye, stuffy nose, blocked nose, flushing of one side of the face or sweating on one side of the face. So when a doctor hears the symptom, it's cluster headaches. Now, the problem with cluster headaches is that it may be treated by alcohol, can be triggered by excess heat. So if you're exercising in a hot atmosphere, you can bring them on. Even solvents, petrols, perfumes could trigger, but everybody's different. OK. So how do you treat it? Now, this is your paracetamol, your ibuprofen, they will not work at all, right? What you need to do, if these symptoms I'm describing sound like you, you go and see your GP because the GP can treat you with a drug, a group of drugs called tryptans. Now, tryptans came out years ago for migraine. Now, tryptans, you can self-inject straight into the thigh. You can have a nasal spray or sublingual tablets, so they're very fast acting and they can help. Now, the GP could prescribe that, but you may be passed on to a specialist clinic where you may be given oxygen and other drugs that can control it. Well, Chris, just to get you through some of the other ones which are less specialist, these are called primary headaches and one of which is a tension headache, self-explanatory. Well, yeah, you know, the commoner garden headache, you know, about 70% of headaches are the tension type headaches, can be caused by stress, can be caused by just everything around you, bad posture in your chair. But easily sorted. Well, of course, what do we do? We treat ourselves with paracetamol and ibuprofen and that usually does the trick. But a headache that's persisting despite that form of treatment needs to be checked out by you. So don't ignore a persistent headache every day and keeps going back. And migraine, you mentioned, you threw in there saying it could sometimes people with cluster headaches might think it's migraine. What's the difference? Well, migraine is very common. Eight million sufferers in the country. And with migraine, it's not just a headache. If you've not had migraine, oh, it's just a headache. Now, we've got Sarah Hardy here. She says, and Anna Lees Owens, migraines make me vomit and I get shakes. It's not a headache like other people think. You get nausea, dizziness, numbness, disturbed vision. Mine can go on for days. It's absolutely exhausting. She's describing some of the classic symptoms. And again, it's a severe pounding, throbbing headache usually affecting one side. About 80% of sufferers, 80, 90% get nausea, 20, 30% get vomiting and you dislike bright lights and loud noises. One of the factors is obviously recognizing the trigger. If you can actually self-diagnose and recognize and what brings this on, that's your halfway here. And you can do this. Just keep a diary. What was happening before I got those headaches? Everybody's heard about chocolate, cheese, and red wine. But there are so many other factors as well. But you'll very often identify it. Then you've got to try and remove it. If you do get migraine, the simple thing is to start with soluble aspirin or soluble paracetamol and an antiemetic, which stops you feeling sick and helps the drugs to work quicker or move on to more effective treatments. What about a hormone headache? We've been hearing about that as well. Hormone headaches. Yeah, well, especially in women because of the cycle through the month with oestrogens, et cetera. And of course, a lot of women get headaches premenstrual. It's part of the premenstrual syndrome. Headaches in the menopause, headaches on the pill. Interesting that migraine can be improved during pregnancy. Pretty drastic treatment for you. It's very drastic treatment. The changing levels of hormones have these powerful effects on the body. So for hormone headache, is it just a normal treatment? Let's say you're on the pill and you get the headaches when you're on the pill-free days. You can take the pill continuously for a few months, and that can help it. Sometimes adding oestrogen before or after a period can ease the hormone. And of course, for menopausal headaches, HRT would help. What about something my wife suffers from greatly? Selective headaches. Is this to prevent you doing something? Well, I know she developed someone that suits her. That's basically... Women's prerogative, I think. When I was a kid, I had a lot of headaches, and I realized it was through not drinking water. Oh, yeah, yeah. Dehydration, yeah. Oh, dehydration. If it's heart and you've not been drinking, yeah, your headache, your field of ting, that's something that could just be dehydrated.

The video in the transcript does touch on areas of uncertainty, though not exhaustively. The speaker acknowledges that the exact causes of cluster headaches, much like migraines, are not fully understood. They mention disturbances in blood supply and chemical imbalances in the brain without pinpointing specific mechanisms. This indicates a recognition of uncertainty in the underlying causes of these severe headaches.

Furthermore, while describing potential triggers such as alcohol, heat, and solvents, the speaker notes that ""everybody's different,"" signaling that individual variability adds to the complexity and unpredictability of treating cluster headaches. This variability is an implicit acknowledgment of uncertainty in how different patients may experience and be affected by these triggers.

However, the video doesn't delve deeply into other significant uncertainties, such as the long-term efficacy of treatments or the potential side effects of medications like tryptans. The discussion primarily revolves around symptom management and immediate relief strategies.

QNkU1VoDSF4,"With another type of headache called cluster headache, which is more common in men than women, these patients have absolutely horrible pain to the point where it's also called a suicide headache. The headache lasts 45 minutes to 3 hours max, whereas migraine goes 4 hours to 72, typically. But the cluster headache patients, even though it's a vascular headache, it starts from a different part of the brain, the hypothalamus, not the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which is the migraine generator. And these folk can't lie down. They walk. They cannot be comfortable anywhere. They will literally hit their heads against the wall to try to create pain that will have them shift their awareness of the pain away from the terrible pain of the cluster headache, which is described by, I'd say, 9 out of every 10 cluster patients I've ever seen as, quote, there's somebody inside my skull trying to push my eye out with a hot poker, end quote. And I say that, and what's fascinating to me is people that, to my knowledge, have never met themselves, met each other, have this same explanation, almost word for word with what I just said. So there's different types of headaches that have different ways of presenting, but the only commonality between tension-type headache and migraine is central sensitization after a while. And one last comment is that in migraine patients, when they develop central sensitization, we now know that they can also develop allodynia. Allodynia is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. And what's so fascinating in the migraine patient is migraine is a brain disease, okay? And you might have pain, and that's why it hurts to comb your hair when you have a migraine. That's the allodynia, but some people have what's called extra-cephalgic allodynia, or pain, in their back or their hands. So even though this is a brain disorder that's associated with a headache, they will get pain in their hands. And last comment is there's a percentage of patients, anywhere from 7 to 30 percent of patients, with migraine, that do not respond to atriptan, which is like a bullet. It hits the 5-HT, the serotonergic 1, B, D, and F subreceptors. And once a patient develops allodynia, atriptan will not work, and we weren't cognizant of that relationship until the last couple of years. Yes, there is. You'd use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory first, wait an hour, and then in not all, but a good percent of the patients, atriptan can be used and be successful to stop the headache or at least bring down the pain level significantly. That's pretty new information, new being the last five years. And what's so fascinating about migraine, migraine was written about for hundreds of years, and we're still learning even basic facts. I mean, we all knew that during migraine it hurt to run your hand through your hair or to comb your hair, but now we know that it's truly allodynia, which can only come from central sensitization.",Cluster Headache,2,4,5,1,4,4,1,5,2,2,1,2,2,4,2,"Score: 2

The transcript does not clearly specify the sources of information used (aside from the author's statements). While the speaker provides detailed information on various types of headaches and discusses medical concepts like central sensitization and allodynia, there is no mention or citation of external sources, studies, or references that support these claims. Therefore, the viewer has no way to verify the information's accuracy or the authority of the speaker beyond their own expertise. Additionally, although the speaker mentions clinical observations, such as patients describing their pain, there is no clear context as to whether these observations are drawn from documented studies or personal anecdotal experience. Thus, the video is ineffective in providing transparency about the origins of its information.

The transcript generally conveys the timeframe for when the information was produced quite clearly, though not with perfect precision. It distinguishes between longstanding knowledge about headaches and newer insights gained in recent years. For example, it explicitly mentions that the understanding of allodynia in migraine patients developed ""in the last couple of years"" and refers to certain treatment protocols being effective within ""the last five years."" This indicates the recent development of knowledge and treatment advancements in the field of headache and migraine research.

However, the transcript can be slightly ambiguous at times. For instance, while it states that the relationship between allodynia and the ineffectiveness of atriptans was recognized ""until the last couple of years,"" it doesn't specify the exact timeframe, which could be more precise.

It delves into the nature of these headaches, the regions of the brain they are associated with, and specific symptoms like allodynia. One point that stands out is the nuanced understanding of treatment failures; for instance, it mentions that 7 to 30 percent of migraine patients do not respond to triptans, indicating that alternative treatments may be necessary. Furthermore, the transcript discusses a stepwise approach to treating migraines, starting with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) before moving on to triptans if necessary.

While the video does emphasize a primary treatment strategy and mentions the lack of response to certain treatments in a subset of patients, it does not elaborate extensively on the full spectrum of available treatments.

5phVskfFUhU,"What are cluster headaches? Cluster headaches are a different type of primary headache disorder. They belong in a family of headaches called trigeminal autonomic cephalogies. They can sometimes have symptoms similar to migraines such as nausea, but they are different types of headaches. Cluster headaches are strictly one-sided headaches, typically around the eye, and these are very severe excruciating headaches lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours. Typically patients with cluster headache have what we call unilateral ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. This can be symptoms such as tearing of the eye, redness of the eye, swelling of the eyelid, runny nose or stuffy nose on the side of the headache.",Cluster Headache,4,4,5,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"**Score: 4**

Explanation: The video transcript provides some context about a personal story related to cluster headaches, featuring a staff member of ""The Doctors."" It does effectively communicate the personal experience and the impact of cluster headaches on the individual’s life. However, it falls short of providing a clear timestamp or detailed background information about when the medical information or treatments described - such as the oxygen treatments or medications like Imitrex and steroids - were produced or became standard medical practices.

For a score of 5, the video should explicitly state relevant dates, such as when Robert's treatment was initiated, when the consultations took place, or when certain methods became viable treatment options. This would help the audience understand the medical timeline and the evolution of treatment for cluster headaches more clearly. 

The subjective nature of the personal anecdotes also detracts from the concreteness of the production timeline for the medical information presented. While the experiential accounts are valuable, they do not provide an objective framework for assessing the recentness or currency","Score: 3

Explanation: The video transcript offers a detailed and personal account of Robert's struggle with cluster headaches, providing both subjective experiences and some medical insights. It covers Robert's perspective extensively, which can generate empathy and a deeper understanding of the daily challenges faced by individuals with this condition. However, the video's focus is primarily on an emotional narrative rather than a comprehensive, scientific discussion about cluster headaches.

The content does include some professional input from Dr. David Kudrow, offering a clinical perspective on the nature and treatment of cluster headaches. This introduces an element of medical expertise and attempts to balance the narrative. However, the conversation lacks depth in exploring various treatment options, statistical data, or alternative viewpoints.

Moreover, the aim seems more focused on human interest rather than presenting an unbiased, educational viewpoint. By concentrating heavily on Robert's individual story and less on a broader perspective, the video risks over-personalization which may not fully represent the spectrum of experiences of all cluster headache sufferers or the latest advancements","**Rating: 2**

**Explanation:**
The transcript does not provide substantial details of additional sources of support and information. Here are the reasons for such a rating:

1. **Lack of General Resources:** There is a distinct absence of mentioned resources such as support groups, websites, helplines, or literature where viewers can seek more information about cluster headaches or how to manage them. 

2. **Expert Consultation:** The sole source of information aside from personal experience is the consultation with Dr. David Kudrow. While it is valuable, it is limited to the specifics of the individual case (Robert’s struggle with cluster headaches) and does not extend to a broader audience seeking help.

3. **Educational Content:** The content contains some educational information about the categorization and symptoms of cluster headaches but does not follow up with recommendations on where viewers can learn more or seek help.

Explanation: The video transcript highly details the uncertainty surrounding cluster headaches. Several elements point to areas of unresolved or partially understood medical challenges. Firstly, the afflicted individual, Robert, mentions having tried various treatments, including consultation with neurologists, oxygen therapy, and medications like Imitrex and steroids, without achieving lasting relief. This indicates a significant uncertainty in effectively managing his condition. Moreover, the transcript brings up an episodic pattern where the headaches strike every three years, questioning why this specific temporal pattern exists, a point that even the expert, Dr. David Kudrow, identifies as ""bizarre."" Dr. Kudrow acknowledges the peculiar nature of the disorder and implies that there is still much to learn and understand about cluster headaches, differentiating them from more well-known headache types like tension and migraines. Thus, the transcript captures both personal uncertainty from Robert’s perspective and broader medical uncertainties acknowledged by the healthcare professional, demonstrating the complexity and the gaps in understanding about this medical condition.","Score: 1

Explanation: The video transcript primarily focuses on the personal experiences of Robert, a staff member suffering from cluster headaches, and does not provide a thorough description of how various treatments for cluster headaches work. While it briefly mentions that Robert has undergone oxygen treatment, took Imitrex, and was on steroids, there is no detailed explanation of the mechanisms by which these treatments alleviate symptoms. The transcript lacks specific information on how oxygen therapy might reduce headache intensity or how medications like Imitrex and steroids function to relieve pain or inflammation associated with cluster headaches. Instead, the video leans more towards describing Robert's symptoms, the severity of his condition, and its impact on his daily life. It also includes a consultation session with a headache specialist but does not delve into the scientific or medical explanations behind the treatments mentioned. Therefore, based on the absence of detailed descriptions of how each treatment works, the score is justified as a 1.","Score: 1

Explanation: 

The transcript provided does not describe the benefits of each treatment for cluster headaches. Throughout the dialogue, there is a heavy emphasis on personal experiences and the emotional struggles faced by Robert, who suffers from cluster headaches. Although some treatments such as oxygen therapy, Imitrex, and steroids are mentioned briefly, there is no detail given about their specific benefits. 

The discussion primarily revolves around the characterization of the severity and patterns of the headaches rather than exploring how each treatment could benefit individuals with similar conditions. Dr. Kudrow provides some clinical details about the disorder, but there is no in-depth explanation or comparison of the various treatment options and their benefits.

Overall, while the video may be emotionally compelling and informative regarding the nature of cluster headaches, it does not fulfill the criteria of describing the benefits of each treatment.","Score: 1

The transcript provided primarily focuses on personal narratives and descriptive accounts of the condition known as cluster headaches experienced by an individual named Robert. It touches upon his struggles, the impact on his daily life, and some of the treatments he has attempted, such as oxygen therapy and medications like Imitrex and steroids. However, the video does not explicitly detail the risks associated with each of these treatments. 

The discussion centers around the personal experiences and emotions related to the condition, providing a glimpse into the subjective suffering and day-to-day challenges faced by the individual. Nevertheless, there is minimal to no information addressing the potential side effects, complications, or specific risks of the treatments mentioned. For instance, no explanation is given regarding possible adverse effects of using Imitrex (a medication commonly used to treat migraines) or the long-term implications of steroid use.

While it touches on the chronic and debilitating nature of the condition and mentions that various treatments tried by the individual did not help, it does not explicitly delve into the specific outcomes or long-term consequences if no treatment is used. There is an implicit suggestion of the ongoing suffering and reduced quality of life without effective treatment, but it lacks a direct and comprehensive exploration of what would happen if the individual stopped all treatments entirely. Statements about the unpredictability and severity of the headaches give some insight into the day-to-day struggles but do not fully address the broader question of untreated progression and potential complications.

The transcript provides a detailed personal story about an individual suffering from cluster headaches but does not thoroughly describe how various treatment choices affect his overall quality of life. While it does mention different treatments such as oxygen therapy, Imitrex, and steroids, the transcript lacks a comprehensive discussion of the impact these treatments have on his day-to-day living or overall quality of life. There's no mention of improvements, side effects, or long-term outcomes. The focus is primarily on the symptoms, the nature of cluster headaches, and the diagnostic process rather than on a detailed evaluation of treatment efficacy or their holistic impact on the patient’s life.

Therefore, the video only partially addresses the question, as it includes some references to treatments but fails to discuss how these treatments tangibly and meaningfully affect the overall quality of life.

2xLTTU5iLZQ,"My name is Brighton Roper. I'm a licensed acupuncturist. Today we are in my office in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I'm going to be talking about the treatment of cluster headaches with acupuncture. Cluster headaches tend to occur in a cyclical pattern or cluster, and that's why they're given that name. And unfortunately for the patients who get this type of headache, the clusters can last for weeks at a time, and the patient can even have more than one bout of cluster headaches a year. Some characteristics of cluster headaches are that they can come on suddenly, affect one side of the face, and they can even cause eye pain or eye redness. In terms of Chinese medicine, three of the patterns that most closely fit with cluster headaches would be liver yang rising, liver fire rising, or blood stasis. So some of the points that would be commonly used to treat a cluster headache are actually at distal parts of the body, such as the foot. Liver two is a point on the liver channel that clears liver heat and fire and keeps it from rising. Kidney three. Large intestine four is actually the command point of the face, and it will help direct the treatment to the head and face where the headache is. San jiao five. Good for alleviating pain. And some points in the local area. Gallbladder eight, and tai yang, which is an extra point.

The video transcript does not describe the risks associated with either of the treatments mentioned for acute management of cluster headaches. The speaker primarily focuses on the dosage and administration routes for sumatriptan and the use of oxygen but does not mention any potential side effects, contraindications, or risk factors that would be important for both medical practitioners and patients to consider. 

For instance, while discussing sumatriptan, the transcript specifies the dose limits and the methodology to administer it but omits any mention of common side effects such as chest pain, dizziness, or potential cardiovascular risks. Similarly, the use of oxygen is recommended without addressing possible contraindications or conditions under which oxygen therapy might not be advisable.

A comprehensive discussion on medical treatments should cover not only the efficacy and proper usage protocols but also inform about risks and safety considerations to ensure informed decision-making. In this case, the absence of risk information significantly limits the educational value of the video regarding the safe and appropriate management of cluster headaches","**Score: 1**

**Explanation:**

The video transcript provided primarily focuses on the acute management and treatment of cluster headaches, predominantly discussing the use of sumatriptan and oxygen as per NICE CKS guidelines. There is no direct or detailed description of what would happen if no treatment is used for cluster headaches. 

For example:
- The speaker mentions recommended treatments (sumatriptan and oxygen) and what not to use (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids, and oral triptans).
- The emphasis is on immediate management protocols for healthcare providers and medical students preparing for exams. 

There is no discussion of the natural progression of cluster headaches or the consequences of opting out of treatment. The transcript lacks any reference to the impact on quality of life, potential exacerbation of symptoms, or long-term ramifications if cluster headaches are left untreated. 

Given these points, the transcript clearly does not address the scenario of untreated cluster headaches, which justifies the lowest score of 1","Score: 1

Explanation:
The video transcript provided gives a detailed overview of the acute management of cluster headaches, focusing on two main treatment options: 100% oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan. While it does a good job explaining the dosages and administration guidelines as well as what not to use in acute management, it falls short in discussing how these treatment choices affect the overall quality of life for the patient. There is no mention of long-term implications, patient comfort, ability to perform daily activities, side effects, or any considerations beyond the immediate alleviation of headache symptoms. 

In order to rate higher on the scale, the content would need to address how effectively these treatments contribute to the patient's well-being over time, how manageable the treatments are for patients in day-to-day life, and how they might impact other aspects of health and quality of life. Since the information is only about the immediate resolution of headache pain and does not extend to quality of life considerations, the score is appropriately","**Score: 3**

**Explanation:**

The transcript partially addresses the question of whether there may be more than one possible treatment choice for acute cluster headache management. While the video clearly mentions two primary treatments according to NICE CKS guidelines—sumatriptan (specifically subcutaneous) and 100% oxygen—it does not delve deeply into alternative treatments or acknowledge that there may be other viable options outside of these guidelines. 

The focus is almost exclusively on these two treatments, suggesting that they are the standard and preferred methods, but there is no exploration of other potential choices, even though it hints that intranasal sumatriptan is an option. By stating “do not give paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, or oral triptans,” the speaker rules out other common treatments without discussing any additional alternative treatments that might be considered under different circumstances or guidelines.

Therefore, while the video does make it clear that there are two main treatment","**Score: 1**

The video transcript does not provide support for shared decision-making. Shared decision-making typically involves collaboration between clinician and patient to arrive at the best treatment plan, considering patient values, preferences, and circumstances. In this transcript, the focus is purely on the clinical management of acute cluster headaches based on NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines. The speaker details the use of sumatriptan and oxygen for treatment but does not address patient involvement, preferences, or values in any capacity.

The content is more instructive in nature, aimed at educating medical professionals, likely for examination purposes or clinical practice, and it doesn't foster a patient-centered approach. There's no mention of discussing options with patients, aligning treatment with their preferences, or considering their individual circumstances, which are critical components of shared decision-making. Instead, the video outlines a step-by-step protocol for managing a medical condition, which while clinically relevant, lacks the collaborative elements essential for shared decision-making.",set()
PrbIkzAX5xc,"Hi, this is Tom from zero to finals dot com. In this video I'm going to be going through cluster headaches and you can find written notes on this topic at zero to finals dot com slash cluster headaches or in the neurology section of the zero to finals medicine book. So let's jump straight in. Cluster headaches cause severe and unbearable unilateral headaches usually around the eye. And they're called cluster headaches because they come in clusters of attacks and then disappear for a while. For example, a patient might have three to four attacks a day for a week or month followed by a pain free period lasting one to two years. Attacks last between 15 minutes and three hours and they can be triggered by things like alcohol, strong smells or exercise. A typical patient that you might see in your exams who's got cluster headaches is a 30 to 50 year old male smoker coming in with severe pain around one eye. So what are the symptoms? Well cluster headaches are often described as the most severe and intolerable pain in the world. They're sometimes referred to as suicide headaches due to the severity of the pain. And symptoms are all typically unilateral with a red swollen and watery eye, pupil constriction which is called meiosis, eyelid drooping which is called ptosis, nasal discharge and there can be facial sweating on one side. So what are the treatment options for cluster headaches? Well there's the acute management which aims to improve the symptoms of the cluster headache at the time and this can be with triptans, for example sumatriptan injected subcutaneously at the start of the headache. Another option which often comes up in exams is high flow 100% oxygen which is breathed for 15 to 20 minutes to try and improve the symptoms of the headache. And patients are often given oxygen to keep at home to use during the headaches to help with the symptoms. So my top tip at this point is to remember that oxygen is used to treat the symptoms of a cluster headache and this is quite a unique fact that can be brought up in exams. There's also options for prophylaxis to prevent the cluster headaches from occurring and this can be things like verapamil, lithium and prednisolone can actually be used for a short course for two to three weeks to try and break the cycle during a cluster of headache attacks. So thanks for watching, I hope you found this video helpful. If you did, don't forget there's plenty of other resources on the Zero to Find All website including loads and loads of notes on various different topics that you might cover in medical school with specially made illustrations. There's also a whole test section where you can find loads of questions to test your knowledge and see where you're up to in preparation for your exams.

dM26LYviWhY,"Hello again everyone, my name is Damian and I'm a headache clinician at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help. So feel free to leave a comment below or message us directly or you can give us a call on 1800 HEADACHE to get started on treating your headaches and migraines.

**Explanation:**

The video transcript provides a fairly comprehensive explanation about cluster headaches, including symptoms, frequency, and possible causes, but it only partially describes how each treatment works, warranting a score of 4 out of 5. 

Firstly, the video does describe the mechanism of action for tryptans (a common treatment for cluster headaches). It explains that tryptans help reduce dilation of the blood vessels and inhibit information from the cervical afferents, thus decreasing signals sent to the brain stem and inhibiting pain into the head.

7l7BvjS9b94,"You want to put your head in a vice. I've done everything from pace to cry from the pain. It would be easy to think that Stephen Burley's description of his cluster headaches are an exaggeration, but when you look at drawings online from cluster headache sufferers, you start to get a sense of the intensity of the pain. Your eye is going to explode. Steve learned they're called cluster headaches because they occur in groups every day for weeks or months, then disappear for extended periods, which is different from migraines. Cluster pain is short. The attacks are almost always less than 90 minutes. Migraine attacks last four to seventy-two hours with nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. Cluster travels with redness of the eye, drooping of the lid. Now there may be a non-drug, non-interventional way to get relief from cluster headaches. It's a small battery-powered external nerve stimulator called GammaCore that's used as soon as a cluster headache comes on. The attacks are incredibly intense, but also brief, so giving a drug that takes a couple of hours to kick in like an oral medication is sort of pointless. The GammaCore device is placed over the area of the neck where the vagus nerve travels. It delivers mild electrical stimulation through the skin to the vagus. The impulses are thought to travel up to the brain stem where they short-circuit the headache. A couple of double-blind studies that show a large number of people are pain-free 15 minutes after treating with the vagus nerve stimulator. The GammaCore has just been cleared by the FDA, so it probably won't be available in the U.S. until this fall. Price has not yet been set, but it is expected to be covered by insurance.

Explanation: The video transcript provides a fairly detailed description of how the treatment for cluster headaches works, warranting a score of 4. It introduces the GammaCore device and explains its function in alleviating pain by stimulating the vagus nerve through mild electrical impulses. This description indicates the mechanism behind the treatment, highlighting how the impulses are believed to ""short-circuit"" the headache by traveling up to the brain stem.

However, the transcript does not delve into the specific biological or neurological processes that occur when the vagus nerve is stimulated, nor does it compare the mechanism of the GammaCore device with other traditional treatments in depth. While technical, scientific details about the device’s efficacy from the studies are mentioned, they are not extensively elaborated upon.

Furthermore, while the transcript distinguishes between cluster headaches and migraines, it does not elaborate on how treatments for migraines work, if mentioned at all. Hence, while the description is clear and informative regarding the GammaCore device, it stops short","Score: 3

The video transcript partially describes the benefits of each treatment. It goes into detail about the intensity and characteristics of cluster headaches, differentiating them from migraines, which sets the stage for discussing treatment options. Specifically, it highlights the GammaCore device, a non-drug, non-interventional treatment for cluster headaches. The transcript indicates that the GammaCore device can provide rapid relief by delivering mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve, potentially making a person pain-free within 15 minutes.

Moreover, the transcript fails to offer a comparison with other treatment modalities in terms of convenience, side effects, and overall lifestyle implications. For instance, it mentions that drugs may not be effective for the short duration of cluster headache attacks, yet it doesn't go into detail about how using the GammaCore device might change day-to-day living or reduce the chronic burden of the condition. Additionally, the financial aspect is briefly touched upon, stating that the device is expected to be covered by insurance, but","Score: 2

The video transcript scores a 2 for indicating the possibility of multiple treatment choices, although very minimally. The primary focus of the video is on describing the GammaCore device as a treatment for cluster headaches. It is emphasized as a potentially effective non-drug, non-interventional method involving nerve stimulation. This is suggested as a better option compared to oral medications, which are portrayed as ineffective due to the short duration and intensity of cluster headaches. Thus, the discussion about treatments predominantly revolves around the GammaCore device.

However, the transcript briefly mentions that other methods exist by referring to oral medications indirectly (""giving a drug that takes a couple of hours to kick in like an oral medication is sort of pointless""). This implies that not only drugs are a possible treatment choice, but also highlights their limitations in this specific context. While it stops short of describing other potential treatments in detail, the mention allows a minor acknowledgment of alternative therapies.

Link is in the video description. Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors! Headaches can manifest on their own but are also a very common symptom in neck pain patients as more than 60% of patients with a primary neck pain complaint report of having concordant episodes of headache. Therefore, it's essential to find out what kind of headache the patient is suffering from. to start off, let's differentiate between primary and secondary types of headaches. But what does this mean? Simply put, primary headaches are a disease themselves, whereas in secondary headaches, the headache is a symptom of another condition. So primary headaches would be migraines, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Secondary-type headaches are headaches caused by tumors, hemorrhage, other trauma ,TMJ dysfunction, substance overuse or neck pain aka the cervicogenic headache. Now, let's take a closer look at cluster headaches which are primary-type headaches.- Cluster headaches have a one-year prevalence of 53 per 100,000 people around the world with men being affected around 3 to 4 times more often than women at the age of 20 to 40. In order for a headache to qualify as cluster headache it has to fulfill certain criteria: A. at least 5 attacks need to fulfill criteria B-D. B. an untreated episode lasts 15 to 180 minutes and shows a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and or temporal pain. C. it matches either or both of the following: 1. at least one of the following signs and symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and/or ptosis. 2. A sense of restlessness or agitation. There are reports of patients pacing back and forth through the room banging their heads due to the severe pain. D. It occurs with a frequency between one every other day and eight per day. Tools you can use to assess the impact of a headache on your patient are, for example, the HIT-6 questionnaire which you can find in the video description down below. Also note that it can be difficult for our patient to answer all of the questions on duration, intensity and characteristics of their headache during your initial assessment. Therefore asking them to complete a headache diary can help in the assessment and management of the headache and you should be aware that there can be an overlap between multiple headaches disorders.

The video includes information on the differentiation between primary and secondary headaches, specific criteria for diagnosing cluster headaches, and tools for assessing the impact of headaches on patients. However, there is no discussion on treatment options for cluster headaches or how these treatments might influence a patient’s quality of life. The content appears more educational in nature about recognizing and diagnosing cluster headaches, rather than offering a comprehensive guide on management and its implications on living conditions.

Explanation: 

The transcript focuses on the characteristics, diagnosis, and differentiation of various types of headaches, particularly cluster headaches. While it provides a thorough explanation of primary versus secondary headaches and the diagnostic criteria for cluster headaches, it falls short in making it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment option.

The primary focus of the video is educational, aimed at explaining the types and diagnostic criteria of headaches. While it suggests tools like the HIT-6 questionnaire and a headache diary for assessment and management purposes, it does not delve into the various treatment options available for cluster headaches or other types of headaches. The discussion on treatment is either minimal or non-existent.

A viewer of this video would gain a good understanding of what cluster headaches are and how to diagnose them, but they wouldn't come away with a clear understanding that there may be multiple treatment options available. Therefore, the score is a 2 because the video lacks comprehensive information about treatment choices, leaning more towards diagnostic and educational content","Score: 2

Explanation:
The video transcript provides predominantly informational content rather than engaging viewers (presumably patients or caregivers) directly in shared decision-making (SDM). Shared decision-making is a collaborative process in which clinicians and patients work together to make decisions, considering the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances, along with the best clinical evidence available.

Here's why the video scores a 2:

1. **Informational Focus**: The content is heavily focused on presenting clinical information about cluster headaches, their prevalence, and diagnostic criteria. While informative, it does not engage the patient in a discussion or decision-making process.

2. **Assessment Tools Mentioned**: The transcript briefly identifies tools like the HIT-6 questionnaire and suggests using a headache diary for better assessment and management. These tools could facilitate SDM if used appropriately, but the video does not elaborate on how patients and providers might collaboratively use the information gathered to make decisions about treatment options.

YD6q9EXyvZA,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Jacobs. I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

The aim of the video is partially clear. The video features Dr. Jacobs, who introduces himself as a doctor of physical therapy and the inventor of ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release), and mentions his own experiences with chronic pain and fatigue. The primary interaction in the video is a consultation between Dr. Jacobs and a patient named Eddie, who is dealing with jaw issues, headaches, and ear ringing due to teeth grinding. Dr. Jacobs explains the connection between Eddie's symptoms and scar tissue build-up due to prolonged clenching and grinding of teeth.

The partial clarity arises because:
1. There is no explicit statement of the primary aim at the beginning. The viewer infers that the aim might be to demonstrate the ASTR technique based on context clues scattered throughout the video.
2. Much of the video focuses on the patient's symptoms, history, and Dr. Jacobs' initial assessments rather than clearly outlining the purpose or intended outcome of the video.

The video partially achieves its aims. Dr. Jacobs introduces himself and his invention, the ASTR specialty, and sets the context by sharing his personal health struggles. This introduction effectively establishes his credibility and personal investment in the treatment. The video further aims to demonstrate the process and efficacy of ASTR treatment through a dialogue with a patient named Eddie, who has jaw pain and associated symptoms such as headaches and teeth grinding.

The detailed and interactive session illustrates how Dr. Jacobs diagnoses the symptoms, identifies scar tissue, explains the pathophysiology behind it, and performs some treatment techniques. The patient reports a reduction in headache severity during the session, which demonstrates immediate efficacy, bolstering the video's aim to show ASTR's positive impact.

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant to individuals experiencing temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, chronic headaches, or related symptoms. Dr. Jacobs offers insights into TMJ conditions and discusses symptoms, potential causes, and a non-invasive treatment method, Advanced Soft Tissue Release (ASTR). The interaction between Dr. Jacobs and the patient provides useful information about the symptoms, the impact on daily life, and an immediate, observable improvement following treatment. 

While the video effectively presents a case study and practical guidance on TMJ disorders and ASTR treatment, it might not offer a comprehensive analysis of alternative treatments or diagnostic procedures that some viewers might expect from medical content. Additionally, the video includes some personal anecdotes and off-topic conversation, which, though it adds a conversational tone, slightly detracts from the purely medical focus.

While Dr. Jacobs mentions that there is over a four-year study supporting ASTR treatment and over 400 studies utilized by the ASTR treatment model, he does not provide any specific references, authors, journal names, or publication details. This lack of detailed citation makes it difficult for viewers to independently verify the scientific claims or to understand the sources of the information being presented. 

Furthermore, the discussions and interactions in the video largely revolve around Dr. Jacobs' personal and professional experiences, along with anecdotal accounts from the patient. While these can be informative, they do not equate to clearly identified academic sources or scientific literature. For the video to score higher, specific references to studies, research papers, or guidelines from recognized medical bodies would need to be clearly stated, allowing viewers to discern the source and validity of the information more accurately.","Score: 2

Various aspects of the condition and its treatment are highlighted, including the use of high-flow oxygen and a strict schedule for taking medication.

However, the video primarily seems to focus on Mike’s specific experiences and his particular treatment plan. While it does not entirely delve into other potential treatment options, it hints at the complexity and variability of managing cluster headaches. For instance, Mike mentions being on different kinds of painkillers before finding one that worked minimally, implying that there are other treatments out there, even if they weren't effective for him.

There's no other feeling in this world like the beginning of a cluster headache. So if I haven't had headaches for a while and I'm driving down the road and all of a sudden I feel a burn in my nostril, I don't waste a second getting some medicine in me quickly because we're getting ready to go through another episode of cluster headaches. Once I feel that burn, then it's always kind of a stabbing pain like over my eye or behind my eye. It'll just be like a pulsating stab just for a half a second or so and then there'll be an interval in between 30 seconds, a minute, minute and a half and then I'll start feeling another stab. And the cluster headache will just begin to ramp its way up and it happens very quickly. Within about 10 minutes, I can be in debilitating pain. So once I begin to feel those pulses, then it starts usually seeding more in the eye area and the only way that I can begin to describe what it feels like is that if you grabbed your arm and you just pinched it as hard as you could and just twisted it and you held it there. If you take that pain and you multiply it by about two times, that's what it's like having a cluster headache. It's like somebody's just pinching your eye and they won't stop pinching it and the pain is excruciating and that can last all the way up to an hour and a half. So it works its way into the eye, it builds in intensity and then the pain starts going all the way up in the top of my head and down into my neck and a lot of times it's a stabbing, like pulsating pain where all I can do is just kind of moan and groan and you know I'll say Jesus relieved the pain in one breath and then I'll say the worst first word that will come out of my mouth in the next because the pain is just, it's unbearable. I've been on the floor just screaming and hollering before. Anyway, that's what a cluster headache is like for me. If I don't get the medicine in me quick enough, it starts with a slight burn, I feel some pulsating up here, it begins to work into my eye and begins to pinch gradually slowly until it gets into a deep seated pinching pain and then it works its way up in my head and I feel throbbing all in my jaw area and my neck and in my head.",Cluster Headache,3,3,4,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,"Score: 3

The transcript of the video provides a comprehensive and vivid description of the experiences and symptoms associated with cluster headaches. The speaker details the intense pain, the specific timing, the recurrence, and even the gender demographics most commonly affected. However, while the speaker notes that cluster headaches are ""harmless"" and do not cause lasting problems despite being extremely painful, this is the extent of the discussion on what happens if no treatment is used.

The transcript does partially address the question by noting the self-limiting nature of cluster headaches and that they can go away on their own after a certain period. This implies that even without treatment, the headaches may stop for a significant duration, only to return later. The speaker also mentions considering the condition seriously enough to visit a doctor, indicating that there may be concerns about more severe issues.

Explanation:

The video primarily focuses on describing the experience and excruciating pain associated with cluster headaches. It offers a vivid and emotional account of what it feels like to suffer from these headaches, which is helpful for understanding the severity and symptoms. However, when it comes to discussing treatment options, the video is quite limited. The speaker does suggest seeing a doctor and doing some research into cluster headaches, but he does not offer any specific information on treatment choices or indicate that multiple treatment options are available.

This lack of detail regarding treatment options results in a score of 2. The video makes a minimal effort to encourage consultation with a healthcare professional, which implies that treatment is necessary, but it does not sufficiently explain that various treatment choices can exist.

The video transcript provides limited support for shared decision-making. Shared decision-making is a process in which patients and healthcare providers collaborate to make healthcare decisions tailored to the patient's preferences, values, and needs. It involves clear communication, discussing treatment options, potential outcomes, and mutual agreement on the course of action.

Reasons for scoring a 2:

1. **Patient Experience**: The video does a good job of describing the personal experience of cluster headaches, which can help patients relate to the symptoms and realize they are not alone. This is valuable in initiating a conversation with a healthcare provider.

iVWa9Lqf8jE,"Hi, my name's Matt. I'm 43 years old. I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it. Unsuccessfully for me. It might help other people. When you go to the doctors. Do not leave that doctor until they've prescribed you the injections. Or these. You must have the injections and the oxygen. Get an appointment straight away. A neurologist. I know it takes forever. But once diagnosed. They can't refuse to give you these injections. When I pick up a repeat prescription. I get these. I get ten of these. Sometimes I get twelve. I'm not paying £7.80 a throw. Whatever it is for just two of these. I'm going in and picking up a bag of ten. And I'm surviving. Peace out people. Love you lots.",Cluster Headache,4,3,4,1,1,2,3,3,2,3,1,1,2,3,2,"**Score: 4**

The aims of the video are mostly clear but not perfectly organized. The primary aim appears to be providing practical advice on coping with cluster headaches, particularly focusing on how to split doses of medication to maximize their utility. This intent is evident from the beginning when Matt mentions his personal struggle with cluster headaches and quickly transitions into a demonstration of how to split the injections.

Matt's goal is underscored by multiple references throughout the video, such as when he outlines the importance of splitting doses to get more injections out of limited supplies, and when he demonstrates the mechanics of how to do this safely. He also offers a narrative on his personal experience and practical tips, which supports the video’s main purpose.

However, some points slightly detract from perfect clarity. For instance, the video occasionally diverges into personal anecdotes and less structured comments that might confuse viewers about the primary focus. There's also some assumption of prior knowledge (e.g., familiarity with EpiPens and certain terms) which","I would rate this video a 3 - 'partially'. 

The video achieves its aim to some extent as it provides a detailed and personal account of how the speaker, Matt, manages his cluster headaches using injections. This could be highly useful for viewers who are looking for practical advice on handling their own cluster headaches. Matt goes through the process of splitting the EpiPen injections into smaller doses to maximize their efficacy throughout the day, which is a valuable tip for those unable to obtain sufficient medication. He also emphasizes the importance of obtaining the correct prescriptions from doctors and recommends specific treatments like Verapamil and oxygen therapy.

However, the video falls short on several important fronts. Firstly, the delivery is somewhat disorganized and could be clearer. Matt often veers off-topic and repeats himself, which could lead to confusion. The technical instructions for manipulating the EpiPen and administering the injections could be demonstrated more succinctly and with better visual aids.

The video transcript fails to clearly indicate when the information provided was produced. Throughout the transcript, there are no specific references to dates, timeframes, or contextual events that would help ascertain the period during which the information was generated. The speaker, Matt, shares his personal experience and techniques for managing cluster headaches but does not provide any temporal anchors. This lack of time-stamping or date-specific references is critical in a medical context where protocols, medications, and best practices can evolve rapidly. The absence of such details can make it challenging for viewers to gauge the currentness and relevance of the information relative to the latest medical guidelines or treatments. Therefore, as per the criteria for clarity in terms of when the information was produced, the video scores a 1, indicating that it does not meet the requirement.","**Score: 2**

The given transcript reflects a highly personal and subjective account of dealing with cluster headaches and medication management. Here are the reasons for this score:

1. **Personal Experience-Driven**: The video is heavily based on Matt's personal experiences and methods of handling his condition. While these insights might be valuable to some viewers, they inherently bias the video towards his perspective.

2. **Lack of Medical Disclaimer**: Matt's method of splitting injections deviates from standard medical advice. There's no mention of consulting a healthcare professional or related warnings, which creates a potential risk if viewers follow the guidance without professional oversight.

3. **Limited Perspectives**: The video does not present other potential treatments or management strategies comprehensively. While Matt briefly mentions Verapamil and consulting neurologists, these mentions are fleeting and don't provide a balanced view of alternative approaches.

The video does provide some details on additional sources of support and information, but these are relatively limited, which is why a score of 3 is appropriate. Matt mentions that he learned from ""Ouch!"" how to split the injections, which indicates he tapped into an external resource. However, he does not delve into what ""Ouch!"" exactly is, how to access it, or what kind of support it offers.

While Matt does offer his personal email or message option for further questions, this is more of a personal support offer rather than directing viewers to established medical, social, or community resources. He also advises viewers to insist on obtaining specific treatments from doctors, mentioning verapamil and oxygen therapy, suggesting some level of patient advocacy.

The omission of safety information, such as possible adverse reactions, contraindications, or the importance of medical supervision, is significant. Additionally, there is no discussion about the risks involved in modifying doses or methods, which could potentially be dangerous. Instead, Matt's advice centers on practical tips for administration, thereby neglecting critical safety and risk information that viewers should be made aware of.

The speaker lists several treatments such as Coca-Cola (because of its caffeine and carbonation), applying a cold rag to the back of the neck, sitting in a dark room, and using 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. While the speaker explains that these remedies can alleviate or even prevent headaches, particularly focusing on the initial symptoms, the descriptions lack detailed explanations of how each treatment works or the scientific basis behind them. Instead, the emphasis seems to be on anecdotal evidence and personal testimonials rather than detailed, medically validated benefits. Overall, the video provides a basic overview of some headache remedies but does not thoroughly explain the benefits of each treatment, leaving room for improvement in providing comprehensive information.","Score: 1

Explanation: The video transcript provided does not describe the risks of each treatment mentioned for headaches and migraines. The speaker shares anecdotal advice on headache remedies, such as using Coca-Cola, cold rags, and 100% oxygen but does not address any potential risks or side effects associated with these treatments. For example, while Coca-Cola could offer temporary relief due to its caffeine content, it can also lead to other health issues such as increased blood sugar or caffeine dependency. Similarly, while 100% oxygen might be beneficial in certain cases, it requires medical supervision and can pose risks if administered inappropriately. The absence of a detailed discussion on potential side effects or contraindications is significant, making the score a 1 as per the criteria given.","Score: 1

The transcript provided does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used for headaches. While the video does discuss various remedies and preventative measures to alleviate headache symptoms, such as using a cold rag, sitting in a dark room, and inhaling 100% oxygen, it fails to explain the outcomes or potential consequences of forgoing treatment altogether. There is no discussion about the progression or worsening of symptoms, the impact on daily life, or any long-term effects if headaches, such as migraines or cluster headaches, are left untreated. The video's focus is entirely on immediate interventions rather than exploring the scenario of non-intervention, which is why the score is a 1.","Score: 1

Explanation: The video transcript provided primarily focuses on specific headache relief methods such as using caffeine, carbonation, cold rags, and 100% oxygen at the onset of headache symptoms. While it mentions anecdotal evidence from the speaker's friends and implies some relief methods, it does not comprehensively address how these treatments impact the overall quality of life. 

A critical component for a high score would include a thorough discussion on how these treatments influence the daily functioning, physical wellbeing, emotional health, and long-term outcomes for individuals suffering from headaches. Instead, the video is more about immediate remedies rather than long-term treatment plans or lifestyle adjustments. Additionally, the lack of a structured, medically-backed explanation and the emphasis on non-traditional methods without context limit its ability to inform viewers comprehensively about the broader implications of these treatments on day-to-day life quality. Therefore, the video gets the lowest score, as it doesn't meet the criteria needed to address the overall quality of life in relation to","Score: 2

Explanation: 

The video transcript primarily discusses two specific treatments for headaches: the use of Coca-Cola combined with caffeine and carbonation, and the application of 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. While it implies that there are multiple strategies by mentioning these two treatments, it lacks comprehensive clarity and breadth regarding the full spectrum of possible treatment options for headaches, particularly for migraines and cluster headaches. 

Various well-established treatments, such as prescription medications (e.g., triptans, anti-inflammatory drugs), lifestyle modifications, behavioral therapies, and alternative treatments like acupuncture or dietary changes, are not mentioned at all. The language used in the transcript also tends to favor the two mentioned remedies, potentially overshadowing other viable treatments by making assertive claims about their effectiveness.

The video could improve by providing a more balanced view of the many available treatment options, explicitly stating that the suggested methods are just a few among many potential choices and emphasizing the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for personalized treatment plans.

Explanation: The video transcript does not support shared decision-making in the context of medical care. Shared decision-making involves a collaborative process where healthcare providers and patients work together to make decisions, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances. 

In this transcript, the speaker does not include the viewer in a collaborative process. Instead, they are relaying second-hand information about headache remedies without discussing the individual needs or preferences of the audience. The advice given is anecdotal and lacks a basis in scientific evidence, as the speaker themselves clarifies they are not a doctor. Furthermore, there's no encouragement for viewers to discuss these remedies with a healthcare provider to determine their suitability.

The absence of consultation with a healthcare professional, lack of individualized recommendations, and the dissemination of unverified treatments (like using oxygen therapy without medical supervision) all underscore that the video fails to engage in or support meaningful shared decision-making.",set()

I currently work in London at a place called the Shell building. Which I am very very fortunate in that the Shell building is no more than a three minute walk from London Waterloo terminal. My role is planning manager which means I spend maybe two days a week sat in front of a computer analysing all the information I've got. I love coming home mainly because I love my wife. So I know that as I'm walking up the road through the path, through the woods, I know I'm only a couple of minutes away from a hug with my wife. She is the mainstay of my day. We've got a great house. It's an end of terrace, three bedroom, nice quiet road. It's great. It's a lovely place to live. It's a nice area. Now I live in Chandler's Ford. It's a much much bigger place but it's got that same homely friendly atmosphere. My parents are both in their 80s. My mum has just had this major surgery. Dad doesn't drive, has never driven apart from driving people mad or being a backseat driver. So I take them and do their weekly shopping with them. My brother as well as being my brother is my best friend. And like good friends do, we enjoy a pint. So we've got a very very good real ale pub a few miles from where he lives. So I pick them up and we go and have a pint. It does us both good. I love real ales and this is a dying breed this pub. It's a proper pub. It has real ales and it's got a dark horse. It's everything I want in a pub. I spend as much time as I can with my wife. We're fortunate that they've got very similar tastes. She will come motor racing with me to watch the racing and to make sure that I don't get into trouble. And I will go to her to visually impaired cricket. And a few years ago when they set up a cricket team they asked the volunteers to help. I had time on my hands so I went along. I'm undergoing training as a scorer. My wife is one of the coaches. I go along and hopefully add the numbers up. I knew that having a profession that involved numbers one day would drag me down and here we are. Out of nowhere I get a bright shiny headache that starts off in my left eye. And I know within a matter of seconds I'm going to be a necky. My left eye will close and droop. My eye will be watering cochlearly as if I'm crying on one side of my face. But the obvious give away is the fact that I'm going to be curled up in the fetal position. Wrapping my arms around my head and curled up. Stamping, stamping my feet. Hitting whatever is near me. And I hit things so that my hand hurts and takes my mind off the pain. If I am fortunate enough to be able to move then I carry an injection kit with me. And it is... It's a miracle because if I can manage to load the injection and if I can manage to inject myself, within five minutes the pain will be gone. If I can't I'm looking at 20 to 30 minutes of seriously, seriously wishing I was dead. Which is why they're called suicide headaches. I don't have any phobias. But I am scared of the beast. I can't hide from it. I can't run from it. It's with me all the time and I carry it with me. That's what the beast has done to me.

I had them on both sides of my face. I used to rage anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour and a half to two hours. Sometimes maybe four or five hours the whole night. What I used to do is I used to have got to bed when I went to bed. Before I went to bed I went to sleep. I got everything ready. It was a hot water bottle. I used to get a hot water bottle and a bean bag in the microwave. I had a bucket of ice as well. Next to my bed I had my oxygen and a carrier case. I need to take it around. What I used to do with this I had this kind of attachment and I actually used to use the cold air that was coming out of here to cool the inside of my gums. What causes a cluster headache is many many theories and all that kind of stuff has been suggested. There's one doctor Dr. Elliot Schevel who at the headache clinic did a ligation in an artery that runs my upper jaw. Basically what happens is the blood vessel dilates, squeezes the nerve against the trigeminal nerve against the bone and wears the mileage heath away and short circuits the nerve telling the brain that your face has been ripped off. So you've got chronic nose, eye, teeth ache, your ear aches and you want to rub and cry and pace and scream and sway and yeah it was pretty bad. My lifestyle never went out. I knew at night I used to get them. I never used to drink. I couldn't enjoy other people's food. Just to fear there was things that would trigger it off that were in the food and I sort of narrowed it down to basically any drink that's carbonated used to narrow it down. I had to stop smoking because just the smoking would induce it. MSG, monosodium glutamate, modified starch, too much sugar, preservatives, fruit juices, dried fruits, anything like that would trigger this headache. Even a fisherman's that fisherman mint used to do. I used to sleep upright so I never I didn't lie flat and basically it's a very nasty headache to live with and I suggested if anything I'm saying to you sounds familiar I suggest you get hold of the headache clinic find out what they do and how they do it. You can contact them, you can phone them, you can also contact get onto the website the website is www.theheadacheclinic.co.za and you can also find Dr. Chaville's work and procedures that have been put onto Wikipedia.

The video transcript provided is a personal testimonial about cluster headaches and the relief the speaker found through the treatment offered by Dr. Elliot Schevel at the headache clinic. While the speaker discusses the significant impact cluster headaches had on their life and the relief they found through the doctor's treatment, the transcript does not include a detailed description of the risks associated with each treatment option mentioned.

Explanation:

The video transcript predominantly focuses on the personal experience of the speaker dealing with cluster headaches and undergoing treatment offered by Dr. Elliot Schevel at the headache clinic. The speaker gives a detailed description of the intensity and duration of cluster headaches and how their life was impacted by this condition. There is significant emphasis on the lifestyle changes and management techniques the speaker adopted before receiving effective treatment from Dr. Schevel.

However, the video does not adequately address or describe what would happen if no treatment is used. While the speaker briefly touches on how debilitating the condition can be and the multitude of triggers that exacerbated their headaches, there is no explicit discussion about the long-term consequences or progression of cluster headaches without medical intervention. The emphasis remains on promoting the headache clinic and the treatments they provide, rather than on exploring the natural course of untreated cluster headaches.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a detailed testimonial from a person who suffered from cluster headaches and describes both their experiences and the treatment that ultimately relieved their condition. The speaker discusses how the condition severely impacted their quality of life, mentioning the inability to enjoy food and drink, the necessity to avoid certain triggers, the need to sleep upright, and a generally restricted lifestyle. This effectively illustrates how the condition affected their overall quality of life.

Furthermore, the speaker describes the specific treatment they received from Dr. Elliot Schevel at the headache clinic, emphasizing the artery ligation procedure. The transcript underscores the dramatic improvement in their quality of life post-treatment, how they can now enjoy food and drinks without fear, and the positive impact on their social interactions and well-being.

While the video does a good job explaining how the treatment choices improved the speaker's quality of life, it lacks a broad, systemic review or discussion on other potential treatments and their effects. The focus is narrowly on the speaker's","Score: 2

Explanation:
The video primarily focuses on the speaker’s personal experience with cluster headaches and the specific treatment that worked for them, which involves oxygen therapy and an arterial ligation procedure performed by Dr. Elliot Schevel at the headache clinic. While the speaker provides a thorough account of their own treatment regimen and explicitly promotes Dr. Schevel’s methods, the video fails to sufficiently communicate the existence of multiple potential treatment options for cluster headaches.

The transcript mentions that ""many theories"" exist about what causes cluster headaches, but it does not elaborate on other treatment possibilities or provide a clear indication that various therapies might work for different individuals. The focus is overwhelmingly on a single practitioner's approach, without acknowledging the broader landscape of medical options.

For someone seeking comprehensive insights into cluster headache management, the video might suggest that contacting Dr. Schevel is the sole or primary course of action, which limits the viewer’s understanding of the full spectrum of treatments potentially available. Therefore, the score is a 2","Rating: 2

The video provides limited support for shared decision-making. Shared decision-making involves clinicians and patients working together to make decisions that align with the patient's values and preferences, utilizing best available evidence. Here’s why the video scores low:

1. **Patient Experience Focused**: The speaker predominantly discusses his personal experience with cluster headaches and how a particular treatment from Dr. Chaville at a specified clinic worked for him. While this is useful anecdotally, it lacks a balanced view of multiple treatment options, their risks, benefits, and success rates.

2. **Lack of Evidence-Based Information**: The explanation of cluster headaches and their causes is somewhat anecdotal and lacks citations of recent studies or comprehensive overview of treatment options. 

3. **Directive Rather Than Collaborative**: The narrator’s message is directive, urging viewers to consult a specific clinic and doctor for treatment. There is limited discussion about other professionals, alternate treatments, or the informed consent process necessary for shared decision-making",set()
XWAq1AUFUqA,"Hello, my name is Jeff Parker and I am a 42 year cluster headache survivor. It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love.",Cluster Headache,4,4,5,2,3,3,5,5,3,3,3,2,3,5,3,"Score: 4

The primary aim of the video, as stated by the speaker, Jeff Parker, is to share his personal experience with cluster headaches and the treatments he has tried over the years. This is evident from the beginning when he mentions his 42-year ordeal and the various treatments he has used, indicating that he will discuss what worked for him and what didn’t. Additionally, the speaker explicitly states his hope to help others who suffer from cluster headaches, lending further clarity to the video's aim.

However, while the overarching aim is clear, the video does have moments of digression that might slightly obscure the primary focus. Jeff provides detailed narratives around his experiences with specific treatments, his interactions with healthcare providers, and even mentions aspects such as his use of aspirin and chiropractic care.

Explanation:
The video presents a personal account of managing cluster headaches over several decades. Jeff Parker provides a chronological narrative of his experience, including the various treatments he has tried and their respective outcomes. The video is partially clear regarding when specific information or treatments were employed, but it lacks detailed consistency and precision.

Firstly, the timeline is often ambiguous. For instance, Parker mentions beginning cluster headaches at ages 19 or 20 but does not provide specific dates or years for when he tried certain treatments like aspirin, Verapamil, or chiropractic interventions. This makes it difficult to pinpoint exact timelines for each treatment phase.

Secondly, while Parker states that he was introduced to certain treatments (like Verapamil and Imitrex) around 15-20 years ago, these references are somewhat vague and generalized. Specific years, studies, or clinical guidelines that might have been in place during those times are not discussed, which would provide more contextual clarity.

The video transcript provided rates a 3 based on its balance and unbiased nature. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Personal Experience Focus**: The video heavily draws on Jeff Parker's personal experiences with cluster headaches, mentioning various treatments he has tried over the years. Personal testimonials can be both insightful and relatable, but they inherently carry the risk of bias based on individual experiences.

2. **Mention of Treatment Options**: Parker mentions several treatment options like aspirin, chiropractic, Valium, Vicodin, Verapamil, Imitrex, and oxygen therapy. This suggests an attempt to provide a range of potential solutions, which adds a level of balance. However, the emphasis on personal success and failures with these treatments may not universally apply, and the viewer should remain cautious.

The video receives a score of 5 for referring to areas of uncertainty. Jeff Parker, the narrator, frequently highlights the unpredictable nature of cluster headaches and the variability in treatment efficacy. He mentions not knowing when headaches would appear (""I never really knew when they were going to come""), highlighting the unpredictability which is a significant area of uncertainty for sufferers. Additionally, Jeff talks about the differing effects of treatments over time, stating that some medications and methods worked inconsistently or not at all (""Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it""). 

Moreover, Jeff acknowledges gaps in his experience and the limitations of his advice, particularly mentioning treatments he hasn't tried, such as mushrooms, and noting ongoing research in that area (""One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them.

I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",Cluster Headache,3,3,4,1,3,2,1,5,2,2,4,1,4,5,2,"Score: 3 (Partially)

**Explanation:**
The transcript does not clearly specify any external sources or references that the speaker used to compile the information shared in the video. The narrative primarily revolves around the speaker's personal experiences with various medications prescribed for cluster headaches, and interactions with different healthcare professionals including MDs and a neurologist. While the transcript mentions the opinions and actions of the speaker's new MD and neurologist, it doesn't cite specific studies, medical guidelines, or scientific literature that would provide a more robust foundation for the information presented. 

For a higher score, the transcript would need to include explicit mentions of sources such as peer-reviewed medical journals, clinical guidelines, or specific research findings. This would offer viewers a greater context regarding the basis of the claims and recommendations made in the video, ensuring a higher level of credibility and trustworthiness.

**Explanation:**

The transcript provides a detailed account of the individual's experience with various medications for cluster headaches. It mentions specific dates and the progression of events, which helps establish a timeline. However, there are a few reasons why the clarity on when the information was produced is only partially achieved:

1. **Personal Narrative:** The video mainly focuses on the individual's personal story, which could span over a significant period. The lack of explicit time frames for each described event makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact production date.

2. **Medical Updates:** The transcript doesn't provide enough context to ascertain if the medical information (e.g., the discovery that sumatriptan causes rebound headaches, or the advisability of using Topamax for cluster headaches) is current. Medical guidelines and best practices can evolve, and it isn’t clear if the individual is referring to recent medical advice or experiences from years ago.

**Explanation:**
The video exhibits a considerable lack of balance and demonstrates a clear bias towards the negative experiences of the narrator with medications prescribed for cluster headaches. The transcript primarily focuses on the adverse effects and inefficacies of the medications, including sumatriptan, Topamax, and prednisone, without offering any substantial discussion on the potential benefits or the experiences of other patients. Moreover, the qualifications of the MDs and the neurologist are discussed in an uneven manner, with a strong bias favoring the neurologist's opinion.

While the personal account is valuable and provides insight into the narrator’s experience, it lacks a comprehensive overview of alternative medical perspectives or research-based support.

The transcript demonstrates multiple layers of uncertainty throughout the narrative, hence deserving a top score of 5. Here’s the detailed rationale:

1. **Medication Efficacy and Side Effects:**
   The individual experiences uncertainty relating to the effectiveness and adverse effects of various medications such as sumatriptan, prednisone, Topamax, and panelor. The transcript elaborates on these uncertainties through personal anecdotes, showing that the medications either exacerbated the condition or introduced severe side effects.

2. **Insurance and Medical Advice:**
   The patient encounters uncertainty around insurance coverage for sumatriptan, which suddenly became an issue due to concerns about rebound headaches. This led to confusion and frustration, demonstrating ambiguity in healthcare accessibility.

1. **Emmetrex (sumatriptan)**: The transcript mentions that sumatriptan is effective for the user but can cause rebound headaches. It doesn't explain how sumatriptan works biologically, which involves its action as a serotonin receptor agonist that constricts blood vessels and reduces inflammation.

Explanation:
The video transcript primarily focuses on the individual's personal experience with various medications prescribed for their cluster headaches, including Emmetrex (sumatriptan), prednisone, Topamax, and Panelor. While the speaker mentions some side effects and concerns related to these medications, such as rebound headaches from sumatriptan, feeling lethargic and experiencing hot flashes from Panelor, and increased headache intensity from Topamax, the overall focus is on the negative experiences rather than on a balanced view of the benefits and drawbacks of each treatment.

The transcript lacks a structured discussion of the benefits of each medication. For instance, although it's noted that sumatriptan initially helped with the headaches, the emphasis quickly shifts to the rebound headaches and insurance issues. Similarly, the experience with Panelor and Topamax is mostly described in terms of adverse effects without a clear explanation of any potential benefits.

The transcript of the video does not address what would happen if no treatment is used for cluster headaches. Instead, the focus is primarily on the individual's experiences with various medications prescribed for the management of their headaches, such as Emmetrex, prednisone, Topamax, and others. The narrator elaborates on the side effects and the efficacy of these medications, but there is no discussion or illustration of the natural progression or consequences of leaving cluster headaches untreated. Additionally, while the narrator reflects extensively on the adverse experiences and interactions between medications, there is no explicit mention of the potential trajectory or symptoms of untreated cluster headaches within the whole narration. The video content is centered more around the trial and error of different therapies rather than providing a comprehensive understanding of what the clinical course might be in the absence of medical intervention. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate as it lacks any substantial depiction or discussion about the condition without treatment.","Score: 4

The video transcript provides a detailed personal experience with various medications used to treat cluster headaches, specifically focusing on how these treatments impacted the individual's quality of life.

These accounts explicitly showcase the adverse effects on both physical and mental well-being, illustrating how the wrong medication can worsen a patient's overall condition rather than improve it.

However, the video does not extensively cover the positive impact of effective treatments on quality of life. While it mentions that the neurologist provided insights into the correct usage of medications for different types of headaches, there is insufficient information about how proper treatment might improve quality of life.

Explanation: 

The transcript is quite clear that there are multiple possible treatment choices for cluster headaches. Specifically, it discusses the use of sumatriptan, prednisone, Topamax, and Panelor, highlighting the experience with each medication and its associated effects. The narrator first mentions using sumatriptan, followed by a combination of prednisone and Topamax, and then Panelor. Additionally, there is a mention of using oxygen therapy, which the narrator planned to talk about later. Each treatment approach is detailed with the narrator's personal experience, the side effects encountered, and their relative effectiveness or lack thereof. This variety of treatments mentioned underscores that there isn't a single solution for cluster headaches and that different treatments can have different outcomes for individuals.

An8lK5VqNxU,"Hello, my name is Max Edmond and I'm going to share with you today what I do to combat cluster headaches. First of all, Red Bull, I usually drink about a half of one. I take Kudzu root powder as a supplement during the day to help reduce the headaches. When I'm having an attack, I drink half of Red Bull. Any diphenhydramine allergy medicine, this is a Waldro brand. And I also take one BC powder or Goody powder because it has caffeine and it gets to the headache really quick. For the eyes, clear eyes or any Visine will help. Also what's helpful when it's allergy season is a neti pot to clear out the right side. What I normally do is I heat up some rice and I put it into a rice pack and you can tell when it's hot. And then I'll put it in a sock of any sort and I use a funnel to put it in. And then once the rice pack is full, I will rest on a couch or another hard surface and apply the heat to the side of my head that hurts the most. And it's always the right side and I think for most cluster headache sufferers, it is the right side. So this is my advice to you to do this whenever you're having an attack. I usually have one probably about an hour after I take a nap or an hour after I try to go to sleep. And most nights I do sleep on the couch when I'm going through my cycles because on the armrest I can turn my head in this fashion. For some reason it relaxes the side of my neck for the carotid artery where most of the pain comes from and generates from. But most of the pain goes up here to this part of my head. So I have to move my head and apply the pressure in different areas with the rice pack to be able to slow it down. And normally I can get it under control within 15 or 30 minutes. And also if you do not want heat, you can massage the areas and apply pressure to where it hurts the most. But again, one half of any type of Red Bull because of the taurine, one diphenhydramine, usually a 25 milligram, and one BC or goody powder in combination. If you're allergic to any of these, please do not do this. And as a supplement, it cuts the root powder and it will help you get through your cycles faster. Thank you for your time.

The video makes a concerted attempt to offer personal strategies for managing cluster headaches, which is its likely aim. However, several key areas raise concerns, limiting its effectiveness. 

Firstly, the medical advice given includes recommendations for using Red Bull, Kudzu root powder, diphenhydramine, BC powder, and specific eye drops without any professional medical consultation. This could potentially be harmful to viewers who might suffer from contraindications or adverse effects. The video lacks proper emphasis on consulting a healthcare provider before following these suggestions.

Secondly, while some of the methods mentioned, such as the use of rice packs and the neti pot, are generally safe, they may not be evidence-based treatments specifically endorsed for cluster headaches.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a personal account and recommendations for managing cluster headaches based on the narrator's experience. It does not refer to areas of uncertainty in the treatment or understanding of cluster headaches. Instead, it offers definitive advice on the importance of immediate treatment with Imitrex or oxygen when symptoms begin, emphasizing the necessity of prompt action to prevent severe pain.

The transcript is confident in its statements, such as the inevitability of increasing pain if treatment is not administered right away and the effectiveness of different administration methods for Imitrex. There is no discussion of potential variability in individual responses to treatment, the potential for different triggers or presentations of cluster headaches, or any mention of ongoing research or debates within the medical community about the condition.

Given the lack of exploration into uncertainties related to cluster headaches or their treatment, the appropriate score is 1, indicating that the video does not address areas of uncertainty.","Score: 3

Explanation: The video partially describes how each treatment works, warranting a score of 3. It provides some information on the administration methods of Imitrex (Sumatriptan) and indicates the relative speed of pain relief for each method: oral ingestion is the slowest, nasal spray is faster, and needle injections are the fastest. This gives viewers an idea of the effectiveness based on the mode of administration. 

However, the video lacks detailed explanations on the specific mechanisms by which Imitrex or oxygen treatments alleviate cluster headaches. It doesn't cover how Sumatriptan works on a biochemical level, such as its action on serotonin receptors to constrict blood vessels and reduce inflammation. Similarly, the description of oxygen treatment is entirely absent, with the video merely mentioning its use without elaborating on its mechanism of action, such as how it may affect neurotransmitter levels or reduce cerebral blood flow.

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of each treatment for cluster headaches, providing some valuable information but lacking comprehensive detail. 

The video outlines two main treatments: Imitrex (Sumatriptan) and oxygen treatments, emphasizing the importance of immediate administration upon feeling the initial symptoms. This highlights a benefit of both treatments—quick relief is crucial to prevent the pain from intensifying. However, there is no detailed elaboration on the specific benefits of oxygen treatments, which limits the viewer's understanding.

For Imitrex, the transcript identifies three methods of administration: oral, nasal spray, and injection. It describes the relative speeds at which each method provides pain relief, identifying oral ingestion as the slowest, nasal spray as two to three times quicker, and injections as very fast. This comparative speed analysis provides a partial understanding of the benefits related to the method of administration.

However, to score a 5, the video would need to offer more comprehensive benefits of each treatment","Score: 1

Explanation: 

The video transcript provided does not describe the risks of each treatment for cluster headaches. It primarily focuses on the different methods of administering Imitrex (Sumatriptan) and the importance of taking the medication promptly at the onset of symptoms. The transcript mentions the speed of pain relief associated with oral ingestion, nasal spray, and needle injections but does not discuss any potential risks or side effects associated with these treatments. For instance, there is no mention of potential cardiovascular risks, allergic reactions, or other possible adverse effects of using Sumatriptan nor the potential complications or contraindications of oxygen therapy.

A score of 1 is appropriate because the transcript completely lacks any discussion of the risks involved, which is a crucial aspect when evaluating medical treatments. Effective medical advice should always balance the benefits with the potential risks, allowing individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health.","I would rate this transcript a 2.

Explanation: The video primarily focuses on the importance of taking immediate treatment for cluster headaches, outlining different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumatriptan and emphasizing the urgency to prevent debilitating pain. While it does strongly imply negative consequences if treatment is delayed (""excruciating pain,"" ""debilitating,"" ""you can never take chances""), it doesn't explicitly describe in detail what happens if no treatment is used at all. The narrative suggests that immediate treatment is crucial, but it doesn't comprehensively explore the prolonged effects or potential complications of leaving cluster headaches untreated, such as the frequency and duration of untreated episodes, any potential risks to neurological or overall health, and the impact on quality of life. Hence, it only partially answers the question through implication rather than comprehensive explanation.","Score: 2

Explanation:
The transcript of the video provides information on the importance of early intervention for cluster headaches and the different methods of administering Imitrex (Sumatriptan) for pain relief. The speaker discusses the effectiveness of oral ingestion, nasal spray, and needle injections in terms of how quickly they can alleviate pain.

However, while the effectiveness of these treatments on pain relief is explained, the video does not explicitly discuss how these treatment choices affect the overall quality of life. Quality of life encompasses various factors such as daily functioning, emotional well-being, ability to perform daily activities, and long-term side effects, none of which are mentioned in the transcript. The focus remains primarily on the urgency and efficacy of pain relief during episodes of cluster headaches.

Explanation: 
The transcript provides some information indicating there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches, but it lacks comprehensiveness and balance. The speaker mentions two primary treatments—Imitrex (Sumatriptan) and oxygen therapy—but heavily emphasizes the need to take Imitrex as soon as possible, detailing different administration methods for this medication. This emphasis suggests a single primary treatment option rather than equally presenting multiple viable choices.

The mention of oxygen treatments adds some indication of an alternative treatment, but it is stated almost in passing and not elaborated upon. The overall message heavily favors immediate medication, specifically Imitrex, implying that it is the most effective and perhaps only rational choice. This presentation could mislead viewers into thinking that medication is the only effective approach, downplaying other possible therapies.

Therefore, the transcript partially acknowledges that there is more than one treatment option available but does so in a way that is not sufficiently clear or balanced. This warrants a","Score: 2

Explanation:

The video transcript primarily discusses the use of magic mushrooms as a treatment for cluster headaches, with a heavy emphasis on the negative experiences and side effects associated with conventional medications. However, the transcript exhibits several concerning traits that diminish its reliability and relevance as a medical resource.

First, the advice provided lacks scientific backing and contrasts sharply with the established medical consensus on treating cluster headaches. Modern medicine prioritizes treatments that have undergone rigorous clinical testing and regulatory approval to ensure safety and efficacy. The suggestion to use magic mushrooms—a substance known for its psychoactive properties but not widely accepted or approved for medical use—would be deemed inappropriate without thorough clinical validation.

Second, the transcript contains alarmist language and anecdotal evidence, which are not reliable methods of conveying medical advice.

The emphasis on these side effects is quite strong, and it effectively communicates the risks involved with taking that medication.

Secondly, the video advocates for the use of magic mushrooms as an alternative treatment. While initially stating that taking magic mushrooms might worsen headaches dramatically at first, leading to severe pain and emotional distress, the narrator claims that subsequent doses reduce the intensity of headaches without any side effects.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe what would happen if no treatment is used at all. There is no mention of the natural progression of cluster headaches without any intervention. The focus remains on comparing conventional medication with magic mushrooms, rather than providing a scenario in which no treatment is administered. Therefore, the transcript only very indirectly touches on the consequences of forgoing treatment, which warrants a score slightly above the minimum.

Shared decision-making involves discussing the benefits, risks, and alternatives of treatment choices, as well as considering the patient’s values and preferences, none of which are addressed in the transcript.

Second, there is no guidance on how to prepare for a medical consultation, such as suggesting questions to ask a healthcare provider, or how to communicate one's symptoms and medical history effectively. Additionally, there is no mention of collaborative planning for managing headaches, which is a key element of shared decision-making.

ckV6qk27fng,"Cluster Headaches are not migraines. People with cluster headaches experience three to four headaches a day, and these clusters last in periods of two weeks to three months. The headaches can occur like clockwork arriving at almost the same time every day. Men get cluster headaches more than women, and the cause of them is unknown. A cluster headache is always centrally located around the eye. Here are some descriptions of what a cluster headache feels like from people who have experienced them. It's like a burning, hot poker being shoved through your eye while an elephant stands on your temple while someone is punching you in the back of the head and pulling on your hair. Waking out of a sound sleep like somebody hit you in the back of the head with a baseball bat, like my left eyeball is going to explode, crying, moaning, rocking back and forth, praying that it will stop. It feels like my eyeball is in a vise and I have noticed some tautness in the base of my right neck muscles. It's an acute, stabbing pain like a knife behind your eye. It feels like a stabbing pain. I have pain in the jaw, cheek, and neck. The pain is so bad that even touching my hair on my left side hurts. My left sinus cavity is always blocked and I feel I am stuffed up. I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. Here's the basic nature of my headaches. First I feel a slight burning sensation in my left nostril. There is no other feeling like the burn and it can only be associated with a cluster headache. If you think you are having cluster headaches you must familiarize yourself with what the burn in the nostril feels like in order to be able to take medicine right away. Within a couple of minutes of feeling the burn, a 1-2 second pulsating stab of pain will occur over or behind my left eye. The pulsating pain and the burn start increasing in intensity very quickly. In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose.

The transcript in question lacks a clear mention of the sources used to compile the information presented. There is no citation of scientific studies, medical literature, expert testimonials, or reputable databases. The descriptions of symptoms and medications appear to be an amalgamation of personal anecdotes rather than evidence-based medical insights supported by verifiable sources. 

While the narrative does offer detailed personal experiences regarding the nature and treatment of cluster headaches, this anecdotal evidence cannot be considered a reliable or comprehensive source of medical information. The absence of citations such as clinical research references, guidelines from health organizations, or input from healthcare professionals means there is no way for the viewer to verify the accuracy of the claims made in the video.

For a transcript to achieve a higher score, it would need to explicitly reference authoritative sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, clinical trial results, or guidelines from recognized medical bodies, thereby providing clarity about the origin of the information and allowing viewers to trust and verify the content.","Score: 3

However, the video falls short of being completely balanced and unbiased for several reasons. Firstly, it heavily focuses on personal anecdotes and the subjective experiences of individuals with cluster headaches, which, while valuable, may not provide a comprehensive medical overview. Specific details about the lack of efficacy of most over-the-counter medications and the singular effectiveness of Imitrex (Sumitriptan) highlight a strong bias toward one treatment option without sufficiently discussing potential alternatives or differing medical opinions.

So I left toward the end of the movie and went out to the car. When I got to the car, I had what I would call the worst headache of my life. I thought I was having an aneurysm and it just felt like my head was gonna explode. So they came out from the movie and we went right to the emergency room. And from there, they suggested I see a neurologist. So I reached out to the Jefferson Headache Center and signed up to enter their program. And that was a real turning point for me. I got a good diagnosis there almost immediately. And then I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. Because at that point, I really had no idea. And I was scared. The pain was intense. And it was very difficult to work, very difficult to attend social functions, etc., to do anything really, with the fear of having an attack in the middle of it. So many people with chronic cluster headaches and some with episodic cluster headaches go through a process of having difficulty at work, not having attendance issues, having performance issues because they're struggling through this thing that nobody really understands. And they sort of go through this spiral of losing a job and then taking another job, losing that job, then losing their health insurance. And then they end up with very little. Why do they call these the suicide headaches? Well, because it takes everything away from you. I think it's not so much the pain, although the pain is horrendous. Living in pain is very difficult. Any chronic pain sufferer can tell you that. But the inability to concentrate, to maintain an activity for an extended period of time beyond, say, 20 minutes, those are things that really steal from you your ability to do things day to day.

But then I think about my daughters and my wife and what they bring to me and to some degree what I do for them. And that just changes my thinking. There is definitely a way to live and it can be positive. And I think there's always room to have that downtime and that pity party, but at a certain point, that's not fun anymore. And you have to really think about what you can do and that your life's not the same anymore. It's different. And so how do you reform what you're going to do with your life in this new state?

Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one. Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

It feels as though somebody is grabbing your inside of your face and pulling as far out and as far wide as they can. Difficult to watch, often unbearable to experience. The pain of a cluster headache can be indescribable. Some sufferers post videos showing an attack to try and convey the reality. We're using these with their permission. Scott has suffered them for 10 years. He helps run a support group, Ouch! UK. I have knocked myself out on various occasions. Because of the pain, I will find something very, very hard to strike my head against. Because you're driven, it's a primeval driver to stop the pain. Cluster headaches baffle doctors. Far more intense than a migraine, many sufferers, like Rachel, experience them when seasons change. I will get mine every spring and every autumn without fail. Rachel's volunteered for a new research project taking place at King's College Hospital in south London. We're looking to see what happens in the brain during the attacks compared to when there is no attack. Around 40 sufferers will have their brains scanned. This is the posterior hypothalamus and it's also known as the internal body clock. We think that is linked with the cluster headache attacks. They tend to have more cluster attacks around spring and autumn. We don't quite understand the reason behind that. This will be an ambitious, at times arduous project. Volunteers will also be having their brains scanned whilst an attack is taking place. Unless people put themselves forward to things like this, we're never going to know any more about cluster headaches. It's estimated there are around 130,000 sufferers in the UK, possibly more as the condition is often misdiagnosed. This patient, who's asked to remain anonymous, is being injected with steroids and an anaesthetic, a preventative measure that can help but is only effective for a few weeks. We're supposed to damp down the activity of the nerves, hence give some relief to these patients. It's hoped this device, which would be implanted inside a patient's head, could offer long-term help. The way it does is by delivering some electricity around the nerve and damping down the hyperactivity, the excessive activation of the nerves, which is firing without any control.

The primary aim of the video appears to be providing a technique to help alleviate cluster headaches through a series of physical actions and exercises. The instructions are detailed and step-by-step, guiding viewers through the process with the aim of delivering immediate relief and suggesting longer-term practice for potentially more substantial benefits.

However, the video transcript lacks clarity in several key aspects. Firstly, there is no clear introduction or overview providing context about cluster headaches or explaining the rationale behind the exercises. This leaves the audience without an understanding of why these specific actions might be beneficial. Additionally, the instructions, while specific, are somewhat disjointed and could be confusing for someone attempting to follow along, especially without visual aids or clearer segmentations.

9F_FpZB5LWU,"My name is Jenny McLaren and this is my cluster headache awareness project. Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. We can fight the fear of impending attacks together through advocacy and support. Will you join in our crusade?

bSeYYXlH1MQ,"""Hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches?"" Your nose will start running, hurting,and sneezing. Capsaicin is the burning component of hot peppers. Why would you do such an experiment? Anyone who's handled the compound in the lab knows that if it gets up your nose it causes an intense burning sensation, however this phenomenon has not been formally investigated. Therefore it appeared worthwhile to study the effects produced by the topical application of capsaicin in the human nose. It therefore appeared worthwhile because it had never been done before? OK... So they took some medical students dripped some in their nose and they started sneezing, burning, and snotting. Describing the pain as like 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. No surprise, but here's the interesting part. What do you think happened when they repeated the experiment the next day? You'd think they might be sensitized to it, still all irritated and so it might hurt even worse, but no, it hurt less. Then they did it again the next day and the next. By day 5 it hardly hurt at all, they didn't even get a runny nose, no sneezing. Came back the next week, day ten and still nothing. Sheesh, were they like permanently numbed? No, after a month or so the desensitization wore off and they were back in agony whenever they tried rubbing it in their nose. What the researchers think is happening is that the pain fibers, the nerves that carry pain sensation, dumped so much of the pain neurotransmitter called substance P that they ran out. Day after day of this the nerves had exhausted their stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they made more substance P from scratch, which takes a couple of weeks. This gave researchers an idea. There's a rare headache syndrome called cluster headache. It has been described as one of the worst pains humans experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It's nicknamed the ""suicide headache"" because patients often consider taking or have taken their lives over it. It's thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to botox to surgery. But hey, that same nerve goes down to the nose. What if we cause the whole nerve to dump all its substance P? ""Preventative effect of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache"". Same as before, capsaicin in the nose and by day 5 they could hardly feel it any more. Note though that these were cluster headache sufferers and so what was rated as an 8 or 9 on the pain scale by the whimpy medical students was like, maybe a 3 or 4 by those used to the violence of the cluster headache attacks. Having achieved desensitization, what happened to their headaches? Well cluster headaches are one-sided headaches, you only get pain on one side of your head. So those who had rubbed capsaicin in the opposite nostril, on the wrong side of the head, nothing happened. They started out having like 40 attacks a day and a month later the headaches were still going strong, but those that rubbed the capsaisin in the nostril on the side of the head where the headaches were, cut the average number of attacks in half. And in fact half the patients were cured! The cluster headaches were gone completely.

Explanation: The video transcript gives a reasonably detailed explanation of how capsaicin works as a treatment for cluster headaches. It describes the physiological process triggered by capsaicin application in the nose, including the initial intense pain and subsequent desensitization. It also delves into the mechanism of action, specifically how the capsaicin causes pain fibers to dump their neurotransmitter substance P, leading to temporary relief. This process is well-explained over multiple steps, reflecting the experimental design's rationale and findings.

However, the transcript isn't perfect in covering how other treatments work for cluster headaches. It briefly mentions alternatives like nerve blocks, Botox, and surgery without elaborating on their mechanisms.

And during these cycles called cluster periods, the headaches can hit every day, sometimes several times a day. There is no cure, but there are some treatments that can help offer some relief. It really feels like someone stabbing a hot poker through your eye. I tell people like an elephant standing on your temple as well. For 31-year-old Justin Ott, describing what it's like to suffer from cluster headaches is enough to make him cringe. I will get them every single day, multiple times a day, if I don't take medication. Unfortunately, I take medication that sets them back a bit so I only get groups of clusters throughout the year. These attacks happen in a cluster and may last from weeks to months. Patterns of clusters vary from person to person, but most people have at least one or two cluster periods a year. Hi Justin, how are you? Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you. Cluster headaches are the most debilitating of the disorders. It's also dubbed suicide headache because of its severity. The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown and there is not currently a cure. Doctors like Susan Broner of the Headache Institute at Roosevelt Hospital prescribe medications to help decrease the severity of the pain and shorten the headache cycle. Unfortunately, the medications don't stop it 100%, but they help me live my life. Fortunately for Justin and other cluster headache patients, oxygen therapy is an alternative that is successful and has no side effects. In a recently published study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that this treatment is actually more favorable than once thought. Results were that 78% of people with cluster headache responded to high flow oxygen. They were headache free within 15 minutes of using the oxygen. And that was compared to their placebo which was air, high flow air, in which only 20% of people responded. So there was a marked difference between the placebo and the treatment of high flow oxygen. Dr. Broner hopes to see more studies done to show just how this therapy works, but in the meantime, she's happy to see some of her patients pain free. I found oxygen to be the best abortive for me. When I'm home, I can take the oxygen, watch TV, just sitting there, and it's safe. And there's no side effects. And in rare cases, surgery is recommended for cluster headache sufferers who just do not respond to treatments like oxygen therapy or medication. If you're having headaches that disrupt your daily life, you may want to see your doctor so that the two of you, Russ and Lisa, can kind of get to the bottom of what's causing these headaches, what they are, and how best to treat your headaches.

Oxygen can sometimes abort the attacks, but if that fails, sufferers face a bout of excruciating pain that can last for up to three hours. It feels like a hot dagger is being poked through one's eye all the way through one's brain. It's just devastating to see someone in that much pain and there's nothing that I can do for him. There was one occasion that I was laying in bed knowing that I was going to end it. And I was trying to picture the last time I saw my kids. And that was a bad day. I was trying to figure out what I was going to wear when I put a bullet in my head. That was a bad day. With Dan on the verge of suicide and the family in crisis, Leanne made a life-saving discovery. I read on one of the cluster headache sites about people using mushrooms. And at first I thought it was really kind of strange, but at that point nothing else seemed to be working, so I thought it was worth giving it a try. It was the best medicine we ever found. This natural fungi contains powerful psychoactive compounds and has been inducing mind-bending psychedelic trips in users for thousands of years. Unwilling to buy from illicit drug dealers, Dan grows his own magic mushrooms. Here's the medicine chest where the magic happens. Dan has to grow his magic mushrooms in the right environment. I've got to keep the humidity at 99%. Keep the temperature at 75 degrees and fall off. There are mushrooms. Once I pick the mushrooms, I bring them in here, put them under a ceiling fan, let them air dry for 24 hours. Once they're cracker dried, they're good for storage for a year or two. Best two years of pain-free living right there. It's homegrown. Some people have the stomach to just take them like that. But capsules, it's better on the stomach and a lot easier on nausea and easier to get down. He had lost his passion for all of the things that he used to love. And if you say, my dad's taking mushrooms to save his life, a majority would just say, that's ridiculous. They wouldn't believe it. If Dan, like other cluster headache sufferers across America, fails to take the mushrooms every two months, the unbearable cluster headaches return.",Cluster Headache,4,3,4,2,4,2,1,3,2,3,1,3,4,2,2,"Score: 4

Explanation: The primary aim of the video transcript is to highlight the severe impact of cluster headaches on an individual's life and to introduce the use of psychedelic mushrooms as a possible treatment. The transcript effectively conveys Dan's excruciating pain and despair, culminating in his contemplating suicide. It then transitions to Leanne's discovery of psychedelic mushrooms as a treatment option and details how Dan successfully grows and uses these mushrooms to manage his condition.

The video has multiple aims: raising awareness about the severity of cluster headaches, presenting an unconventional treatment (psilocybin mushrooms), and showing the process and potential benefits of this treatment. These aims are clear throughout the transcript. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly stating the purpose at the beginning or summarizing the key messages at the end.

This video transcript partially achieves its aims. 

On one hand, it effectively communicates the severe impact of cluster headaches on a patient's life. It’s visceral and emotionally compelling, showcasing the desperation and the lengths to which sufferers will go for relief. The personal anecdotes provide a vivid, distressing portrayal of the condition and the experience of those who live with it. By describing the intensity of the pain and the mental toll, the transcript successfully raises awareness about cluster headaches. Additionally, it introduces an unconventional yet potentially effective treatment – magic mushrooms – which offers hope and can be seen as life-saving for sufferers like Dan. This aspect of the video fulfills the aim of presenting an alternative perspective on managing such a severe condition.

However, the video fails to achieve its aims fully. Crucial details such as the scientific basis for the efficacy of psychedelics in treating cluster headaches, potential risks, side effects, and the illegality and controversies surrounding their use are missing.","Score: 4

Explanation: 

The video transcript provides a detailed and relevant account of using psychedelics, specifically magic mushrooms, as a treatment option for cluster headaches, a severe and debilitating condition. This topic is highly relevant for individuals interested in alternative treatments for chronic pain or neurological disorders. The transcript highlights the severity of cluster headaches, the inefficacy of conventional treatments, and presents a compelling case of a patient's personal experience with the drastic improvements offered by psychedelic therapy.

Key aspects supporting the relevance:

1. **Condition Explored**: The transcript focuses on cluster headaches, a well-documented and severe medical condition, establishing a clear context and the need for effective treatments.

2. **Treatment Detailing**: The description of the process of growing and consuming magic mushrooms provides practical insights that could interest viewers looking for alternative therapeutic options.

Explanation: The transcript of the video provides a detailed narrative about Dan's experience with cluster headaches, his contemplation of suicide, and subsequent relief through the use of magic mushrooms. However, it does not clearly identify the sources of information used beyond the personal testimony of Dan and Leanne. There is a mention of Leanne reading about the use of mushrooms on a cluster headache site, but the specific source or credibility of that site is not provided. Additionally, there is no reference to scientific studies, expert opinions, or medical literature supporting the therapeutic use of psychedelics for cluster headaches. The lack of citations or references to validated data diminishes the transparency and reliability of the information presented. The video seems to rely heavily on anecdotal evidence, which, although compelling, is insufficient for comprehensive understanding or validation without additional credible sources. Therefore, the score of 2 reflects the minimal inclusion of identifiable information sources beyond the personal accounts of the individuals involved.","Score: 4

Explanation:
The video transcript is largely clear about the timeframes and sequence of events pertinent to the information reported. It details how Dan has been afflicted with cluster headaches, outlines the severity of the condition, and describes the chronological context of his crisis — from contemplating suicide to discovering a potential remedy in magic mushrooms. 

The narrative references Dan's consistent use of magic mushrooms as an ongoing treatment, indicating that it isn't just an isolated incident but rather a regular regimen that he adheres to every two months to prevent the return of cluster headaches. This ongoing use implies a current and continuous application.

However, the video lacks specific dates or more precise indicators of when the information was originally documented or produced. The general timeline is clear — the sequence of discovery, initial skepticism, and subsequent beneficial usage — but there is no explicit mention of years, months, or specific historical context about when these events took place. This omission reduces the overall clarity concerning the precise production timeframe of the information used or reported","Score: 2

Explanation: The video transcript presents a highly personal and emotional story centered around Dan’s struggle with cluster headaches and his use of psychedelics as a desperate solution. While it highlights the severity of the condition and the drastic measures taken for relief, it tends to be unbalanced and biased for several reasons. Firstly, it appears to promote the use of psychedelics as a nearly miraculous solution without adequately discussing potential risks, side effects, legal issues, or alternative treatments that may exist. The emotional and dramatic language, such as describing the pain in vivid and devastating terms, emphasizes the severity of the condition but might also skew the viewer’s perception towards a one-sided view.

The narrative also lacks input from medical or scientific experts who could provide a more comprehensive view of the condition and the potential benefits and drawbacks of using psychedelics. The absence of a broader perspective, including potential risks or counterarguments, results in a portrayal that leans heavily towards advocating for the use of magic mushrooms","Score: 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide details of additional sources of support and information for individuals suffering from cluster headaches. While it presents a personal story and highlights the use of magic mushrooms as an alternative treatment, the transcript lacks references to professional medical advice, support groups, or organizations that specialize in cluster headache research or advocacy. There are no mentions of where to find more information, nor are there links to websites, hotlines, or other resources that could offer assistance to viewers dealing with similar issues. The information about cluster headaches and their treatment is largely anecdotal and personal, without broader context or guidance on safely exploring these options under medical supervision. Hence, it receives the lowest score for failing to provide comprehensive support resources.","**Score: 3**

**Explanation:**
The video partially addresses areas of uncertainty. On one hand, it explicitly mentions that the cause of cluster headaches remains unknown, highlighting an area of medical uncertainty. This shows that not all aspects of the condition are well-understood, and it sets the stage for seeking unconventional treatments such as psychedelics.

However, the video does not delve deeply into the broader scientific and medical uncertainties regarding the efficacy and safety of using magic mushrooms (psilocybin) to treat cluster headaches. While it presents a personal anecdote of success, it does not discuss the lack of widespread clinical evidence, potential side effects, or the legal ramifications of using a controlled substance for medical purposes. Additionally, it does not explore alternative treatments or compare the mushrooms' effectiveness with established medical therapies.

Overall, the video acknowledges some aspect of medical uncertainty but fails to explore the broader context of uncertainties surrounding psychedelic treatment comprehensively. This partial exploration warrants a score of 3.","Based on the transcript provided, I would rate the video a 2.

Explanation:
The video does mention treatments for cluster headaches, namely oxygen and psychedelic mushrooms. However, it does not go into detailed descriptions of how these treatments work on a physiological level. It refers to oxygen as a potential abortive treatment for attacks but provides no further explanation of how oxygen delivery can alter the course of a headache episode. Similarly, it mentions the use of psychoactive mushrooms (psilocybin) and their efficacy, but it doesn't explain the mechanism by which psilocybin might alleviate cluster headaches. Instead, it focuses more on personal anecdotes and the emotional states of those affected rather than diving into the science.

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned, which warrants a score of 3. Here's an explanation for this rating:

1. **Oxygen Treatment**: The video mentions that ""oxygen can sometimes abort the attacks,"" suggesting a potential benefit for alleviating cluster headache symptoms. However, it lacks detail on the efficacy, mechanism, or any additional benefits related to oxygen therapy.

2. **Psychedelics (Magic Mushrooms)**: This treatment is given more focus in the transcript. It explains that Dan uses mushrooms as a last resort, which led to ""the best medicine we ever found"" and mentions ""best two years of pain-free living right there."" It also indicates that the 'magic mushrooms' have helped Dan regain his passion for life and that missing doses every two months can result in the return of unbearable headaches. However, the discussion around this treatment centers more on personal anecdotes rather than a comprehensive detailing of benefits. Additionally","**Score: 1**

The video transcript does not adequately describe the risks associated with each treatment mentioned, particularly the use of psychedelics like magic mushrooms for treating cluster headaches.

Here are a few points explaining this score:

1. **No Mention of Risks**: The transcript primarily focuses on the debilitating nature of cluster headaches and how traditional treatments like oxygen have failed in alleviating the pain. It then describes how Dan turns to magic mushrooms as an alternative treatment without discussing any potential side effects or risks associated with their use.

2. **Psychedelics Details Missing**: Magic mushrooms contain powerful psychoactive compounds which can induce mind-altering experiences. However, the transcript does not mention any of the potential negative psychological or physiological effects these substances can have, such as anxiety, paranoia, or even longer-lasting mental health issues.

3. **Legal and Safety Concerns**: The video acknowledges that Dan grows his own mushrooms to avoid dealing with illicit drug dealers. However, it fails to address","**Score: 3**

**Explanation:**

The transcript partially addresses what would happen if no treatment is used, earning it a score of 3. The discussion of the severe consequences of untreated cluster headaches—namely, excruciating pain and suicidal ideation—is clear. Dan's contemplation of suicide and the specific instance he recounts of preparing to end his life strongly indicate the devastating impact of untreated cluster headaches. This provides a visceral understanding of the severity of the condition without effective treatment.

However, the transcript does not extensively describe a range of possible outcomes if no treatment is used. It focuses almost exclusively on Dan’s extreme emotional and psychological distress leading him to consider suicide, without discussing other potential medical or lifestyle deterioration that might occur in the absence of effective treatment. Additionally, there is no discussion on the long-term physical health consequences or the variability in experiences among different sufferers of cluster headaches.

Explanation:
The video transcript isn't very clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. While it does mention oxygen as a sometimes effective abortive treatment for cluster headaches, this option is quickly dismissed as insufficient for managing the severe pain described. The predominance of the transcript centers around the dramatic personal account of using psychedelics, specifically magic mushrooms, particularly emphasizing its effectiveness after other treatments had failed.

The narrative is heavily weighted towards psychedelic use, focusing on the personal and emotional journey of choosing between suicide and trying an unconventional treatment. The specific mention of only oxygen and magic mushrooms as treatments, with no discussion of other standard treatments such as triptans, high-dose steroids, or nerve blocks that are commonly used for cluster headaches, suggests a limited exploration of treatment options.

Explanation: The video transcript minimally supports shared decision-making. Shared decision-making entails the collaborative process where patients and healthcare providers consider medical evidence, the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances to make healthcare decisions. 

While the video illustrates a patient's (Dan's) severe suffering from cluster headaches and the subsequent desperation leading to an unconventional choice (psychedelic mushrooms), it lacks critical elements of shared decision-making. For instance:

1. **Patient-Provider Interaction**: The transcript does not mention any interaction between Dan and healthcare professionals regarding the use of psychedelics. There’s no evidence of discussions about risks, benefits, or alternative treatments.

2. **Evidence-Based Discussion**: Leanne’s discovery of mushrooms as a treatment comes from an anecdotal source (a cluster headache site), not from a healthcare provider or research-based recommendation.

Places like here, here, here, here, and tons and tons and tons of other places. So if you have cable, you've probably seen my work. I am a fellow sufferer of cluster headaches. I'm lucky. I'm only a seasonal sufferer, so I'll only get my headaches three months out of the year. I'm just ending my cycle as we speak now. I started getting them around 2006. I wasn't quite sure what they were. I thought they were allergies, but I have pretty bad sinuses, so I thought it was all related to sinuses and allergies and stuff like that. Fast forward maybe four or five years, I finally figured out what it was and started to get treatment. Some of it's worked to some degree, most of it hasn't, like many of you know. So I decided that last year that I was going to document people like me to raise awareness. We all know that there's not much going on in the medical community when it comes to people like us. Not a whole lot of research, treatments that don't work. So basically that leads to this. What is the project? It's a documentary. It's a feature length film. So the goals of the film. This is a story about us. It's about you. It's about cluster sufferers. This is to tell our story. We want to basically make as intimate a story as we can. Our goal is to basically spend time with about four to five different families, document their day to day lives, how it's affected them, how it's affected their work, their personal lives, their love lives, their relationships with other people, their friendships, everything. We want to document it all. We also want to document the legislative process. Everything that's going on with advocacy groups, going to the headache on the hill, all that type of stuff. We want to go to these things. We want to talk to lawmakers. We want to talk to doctors. We want to cover basically every angle that we can on this. That's our goal. An all-encompassing documentary but told through personal stories. Okay, so our immediate fundraising goals. The reason why we're making this video is because we need initial seed money. It takes capital to shoot a documentary, even a five-minute documentary. It still takes capital. So this video is to send out to you guys, potential investors, sufferers. We need a little head start. We need something to get us going. Our plan is to take the money, this initial seed money, go out, shoot a couple families, throw that into a proof of concept mini-documentary that we can show other potential investors on down the road to get our full feature-length budget. So, after our initial seed investment, we're going to start a Kickstarter campaign. We're going to be open to the public, open to everybody to pitch in, be a part of this. We want everybody to feel included. We want everybody to have a voice and feel like they're a part of this project. So yeah, if you want to be a part of this, if you want to get involved early on, there is a PayPal donation link here. And there will be one in the description of the video here. And yeah, feel free, give whatever you can, you know, whatever amount helps, even a dollar, whatever you can do.

Today I'm going to talk about the very rare and serious illness that I have. Cluster headaches. And before you say, I suffer from headaches and or migraines. Typical answer here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's not that type of headache. Yes, every now and again we get those pesky little buggers because the neighbor's kid Joshua is joshing around in your rose bush. And now his parents are yelling at you because apparently you forgot to cut it, but fuck that kid. Yes, we also receive all those headaches that make us want to take a bunch of Advil and sleep all day, but it's not that type of headache. Well, maybe the last part. Let me begin with a very brief and scary explanation. A cluster headache is a headache that appears in clusters. It's also relative to time. So let's say I wake up at 5 a.m. each day with a cluster headache. I will wake up at 5 a.m. for the range of attacks. The cluster headache is also very constant in its clusters. I get a headache at 5 p.m. and it'll last for maybe 15 minutes, or it could last for two hours. And I get a short break of maybe 15 minutes to an hour, maybe two, it depends on the person. And it ends abruptly, so you never know when it's going to take a break. I mean, mine could last from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m., but it depends on how many drugs I'm taking. These attacks last not just one or two days, they could last for weeks, and in some extreme cases, more than five months. They're described as one of the worst pain a human being can endure, even worse than childbirth. And I ain't never had a kid, but... That's fucked up. It was today. Another name for cluster headache, suicide headache, because literally people want to die rather than endure it. And, not to mention, there is no treatment, the continuous cycle of clinic visits, pure oxygen doses, something called a nasal spray. So what effect does this have on people? First, of course, they get super irritated and annoyed and angry. It says angry, I said annoyed. But they also get annoyed, so that's something. Pain usually resides in one corner of the face, usually around the temples slash eye area. The eye becomes swollen and often droops. Nose passageways also become swollen, which makes a patient have a runny nose and redness. Hot compresses might help, showers do wonders. They are only temporary. And the headache medicine doesn't work unless you take enough to pass out, and I'm pretty sure that might kill you. You also can't sleep. Normally, people find that cluster headaches, while laying down, cause them to be worse. You know, if you lay on the side that hurts, it hurts. If you lay on the side that doesn't hurt, it hurts. Oh, how is the pain described? And please, if you're easily disturbed, you can skip ahead. This is how I describe the pain. Imagine someone holding pliers. That person thus sticks the plier right on your nerve, and they pull the nerve really, really tightly. Then, they twist the nerve back and forth. The pain is constant, never numbing. As they are doing this, they are also jagging it up and down with a knife, punching you in the face. What are some triggers for this illness? Alcohol, fruity smell, perfumes, light, the fucking sun. Loud noises sometimes, headaches, who would've guessed? Lack of sleep, and smoke. And also, it's not just cigarettes, and you don't need to be smoking them. And if you ever think that, yes, weed helps migraines, it's totally gonna help you, don't do it. You're being an asshole. Don't smoke anything in front of someone who has a cluster headache illness. How do I? Someone who does not know about cluster headaches, insert. Help. Well, for one thing, people experiencing attacks want to be left alone. They may pace around and cry sometimes, but don't touch them. They're not interested in how nice you can rub their back. Tell them it's okay. It might just wanna make them hit you in the face. And please understand, if they do yell, it's not their fault. This is not an invitation that you can yell back. Second point, keep them in a fairly quiet place. Third, darkness is good. Four, put a cloth in hot water and squeeze it out a little bit. Give it to them so they can press it to the area that is experiencing the pain. The heat will thus numb the pain a little bit. But remember not to burn yourself, because you're using hot water, not lukewarm. Watch them in case they burn themselves, because they might not realize how hard they're pressing. Five, don't have triggers around, you sick smoker. Alcoholic bitch. Six, and this is the most important point that a lot of people overlook. Do not have any dangerous objects around them. i.e. sharp objects, hard things like tools, medicines that could be dangerous towards them. No matter how much you know this person and how happy they seem in life, they might do something drastic. This is the same for hitting themselves. If you're experiencing a patient that is hitting themselves, try to replace their hand with a softer object. Like a pillow or maybe a stuffed animal. This way they can get their anger out, distract themselves, and they don't get hurt. So that was a little bit of information about the disease that I have. I think it's a disease. If you currently suffer from it, now you know certain triggers that maybe you didn't know. Maybe some remedies that could help you, like the wet cloth thing. If you have a mother or father or maybe a brother, sister, friend who suffers from this and you didn't know what it was and you just regarded it like, oh, it's just a headache. Well, it's not just a headache. It's very serious. And now you know how to take care of them, so that's cool too. And if you were just curious what is demands one talking about, weird illness, serious illness, oh, this sounds important. Um, it is. Oh, good on you for clicking it. Anyway, this is the end. Tell me, have you ever heard of cluster headaches? Did you know what it was prior to this? Do you know anybody who has a cluster headache? Let's start a conversation. See you later, kleptos. Pfft! That's the end of the video. Why not join the gang? Because together we can be insane. Stop that. What if I just threw up? And I ain't never had a kid, but for some odd reason it makes me become a Westerner. Go out in the hallway and say it. No, it's I suffer. No, do it. What's- Oh, I suffer from- I. You know what, I'm not even gonna use it. No, no, no. Before you say- Oh, I- Really? I suffer- Fuuuck! Suffer. The word is suffer. Why do- I need you. I need you too. I need you so much.

W7woJa444kA,"Cluster headaches are one of the most severe and painful types of headaches. They are characterized by intense stabbing pain around one eye, accompanied by tearing, a runny nose, and drooping of the eyelid. When the hypothalamus in the brain becomes dysfunctional, signals are sent into a bundle of nerves called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. The SPG acts like a fuse box, connecting the brain to nerve endings in the face. When these signals reach the vessels, they cause dilation and activate pain receptors. Pain signals are returned to the sensory area of the brain, where they are perceived as intense pain. The resulting cascade causes excruciating, one-sided pain around the eye that can radiate to the forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on the affected side. Because of the SPG's unique location in the pain loop, it has long been a treatment target. Today, there's a new option for cluster headache patients. Introducing the Pulsante SPG Microstimulator. It's designed to stimulate the SPG, interrupting the signals that cause pain during a cluster headache. A miniature microstimulator is about the size of a penny. Most patients cannot even feel it or see it. During a minimally invasive oral procedure, the microstimulator is inserted along the pathway above the second molar that allows the microstimulator to reach the SPG. The procedure lasts about an hour under general anesthesia and leaves no visible scars. Side effects are similar to other oral procedures and most resolve within 60 days. During a cluster attack, patients place the remote to their cheek to begin stimulation. The remote controller communicates with the Pulsante microstimulator to provide immediate therapy by directing mild electrical pulses to the SPG to interfere with signals, interrupting the cluster headache pain loop, effectively flipping the switch on the fuse box, turning off the headache. Pulsante therapy is a non-drug treatment option proven to rapidly relieve the pain of cluster headaches. There is no cure for cluster headaches, but Pulsante therapy can stop the pain, allowing you to return to the things you once enjoyed and reset the clock on cluster headache.

So there's cluster headaches, migraines, and then there's tension headaches. With migraines, you're going to have that unilateral throbbing headache with associated nausea and vomiting. Sometimes there might be an aura preceding this headache. Other times you will have associated photophobia, hyperacusis. The headache's really going to be aggravated by movement. And then tension headaches are going to be a lot opposite of this. It's going to be more of a global headache squeezing in nature. They might have tight trapezius muscles associated with a lot of stress, not aggravated by movement, usually no nausea or vomiting, and usually no photophobia or hyperacusis. Now when it comes to cluster headaches, make sure you follow the DSM-5 diagnosis for these. It's usually going to include headaches that come in clusters, so headaches that can last for 15 or up to 180 minutes at a time. Usually cluster headaches are really unilateral, kind of like migraines, but they're usually centered around the eye, a little above the eye, or in the temporal area. And then a lot of times cluster headaches, you need at least one of the following physical exam findings. You need to have injected conjunctiva. You need to have lacrimation from the eye, maybe a little bit of eyelid edema, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. Usually in the forehead, there's a lot of sweating in that area or just anhydrous actually. We'll talk about Horner syndrome in a little bit. Sometimes with cluster headaches, you can have Horner syndrome, which is meiosis, so the pupil is going to be smaller in the affected eye. And then ptosis, which is just the eyelid drooping a little bit, or anhydrosis, so a lack of sweating on that side, so I don't have a lot of sweating on the other side. These patients may be very agitated and restless in the room as well. Just make sure you follow the DSM criteria for diagnosis. If you're in the emergency department and trying to make this first diagnosis, usually you have to rule out other big and bad things, and then the neurologist makes the diagnosis. But following those criteria can really help you identify a cluster headache versus something else. As I mentioned before, cluster headaches can be associated with something called Horner syndrome. This syndrome is a combination of ptosis, so eyelid drooping, meiosis, the pupil in the infected eye is constricted, and anhydrosis, so there is a lack of sweating on the affected eye. If the headache's on this side, you're going to see all these physical exam findings on that side. Now, just remember that if you see Horner syndrome, this isn't always associated with a cluster headache. You can have lung cancer that causes this, or something like a carotid artery dissection. Just keep in mind that this syndrome isn't always associated with something as benign as a cluster headache. A lot of these patients are going to be middle-aged men, and the triggers that often precede their cluster headaches unfortunately may be alcohol, it may wake them up in the middle of the night, they may have gotten done with using nitroglycerin use, or any histamine release can trigger cluster headaches. Now with a patient presenting to you in the emergency department complaining of a headache, and it sure does sound like a cluster headache, before you go and treat them for a cluster headache, ask the patient have they ever been diagnosed with a cluster headache. If they have, then usually this is done by a neurologist and they've ruled out some of the other big bad causes of headaches. But if they haven't, definitely ask the patients, and in my mind, always ask any patient with a headache some of the red flags for the headache. And for this, I like to use the mnemonic SNOOP. So the S will stand for Systemic Signs and Symptoms. So are they having any fevers, are they having any neck stiffness concerning for meningitis, or are they having persistent night sweats and now their headache is worse in the morning and they have a little bit of weight loss that's unexplained concerning for cancer. Or do they have a previous diagnosis of cancer, now that they're having these headaches that's concerning for at least secondary cancer going to the brain. And then the N will stand for any neurologic symptoms. So this is obviously concerning for stroke or any mass lesions. O can stand for an onset greater than 50 years old. Obviously concerning for giant cell arthritis or any glaucoma. Since these headaches tend to go and present around the eye, definitely make sure that the eye doesn't feel hard, there's no acute angle glaucoma. You definitely don't want to diagnose them with a cluster headache when they had acute angle glaucoma. And then the next O can stand for an onset that happens suddenly. Obviously concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage that with a sudden onset, the worst headache of your life that we all read about in books. And then the P's can stand for papilledema, obviously concerning for intracranial hypertension. Any positional changes or the headache may be precipitated by Valsalva or any progressive headaches, any new or changing headaches are all red flags of a headache. And make sure you ask this with almost every single patient. So when you're asking some of those red flags for a headache, you obviously don't want to miss some of the more dangerous causes of a headache in that area that may sound like a cluster headache. Like I mentioned before, Horner syndrome can be seen in carotid artery dissections, so make sure the patient doesn't have any neck pain. You usually don't miss this. These patients are in extreme pain and they will have symptoms in this area. Obviously you don't want to miss giant cell arteritis, so they have an itinerary palpation in this area. And they have other signs or symptoms of giant cell arteritis like jaw codification, then definitely work them up in that regard. Other signs or other headaches are trigeminal neuralgia. You can have TMJ syndrome obviously going up into that area. So just kind of think about some of the mimics, acute sinusitis or a glaucoma. You don't want to miss these other headaches that can precipitate like cluster headaches, but obviously be a little more dangerous. So just keep in mind of the mimics of a cluster headache as well. And when it comes to the treatment of a cluster headache, usually this is very simple. High flow oxygen is the treatment of choice. So these patients need to have oxygen up to 10 liters at a time and do that until their headache gets better. And then you can also do some of the other headache treatments like sumatriptan. I've done that as well along with intranasal, Ytcane 4%. These are all very helpful in addition to help control the cluster headaches. And that's it guys. Thanks for listening.

The video transcript provides a thorough overview of cluster headaches, detailing symptoms, associated conditions like Horner syndrome, common triggers, and treatment options. While it offers a considerable amount of medical information, it significantly lacks in offering additional sources of support and information, which is the specific criterion being evaluated.

First, while the transcript advises following the DSM-5 for diagnostic criteria, it misses out on providing specific references or directing viewers to where they could access these guidelines. Merely mentioning DSM-5 isn't sufficient; viewers would benefit from knowing how they can find or consult this manual themselves.

Second, the video's ending only suggests viewers to like and subscribe to the YouTube channel without extending beyond to external supportive resources.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a detailed overview of cluster headaches, including their symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and treatments. While it predominantly focuses on known medical knowledge, it does touch upon areas of uncertainty in several ways.

Firstly, the speaker explains the diagnostic criteria for cluster headaches and emphasizes the importance of ruling out other serious conditions before confirming a diagnosis. This suggests a degree of uncertainty in initial diagnosis, as cluster headaches can mimic other serious conditions like carotid artery dissection, giant cell arteritis, and acute angle glaucoma. The need to differentiate these through thorough examination and history-taking implies areas of potential diagnostic uncertainty.

Secondly, the transcript discusses Horner syndrome, stating that while it can be associated with cluster headaches, it can also arise from other causes like lung cancer or carotid artery dissection. This points to an uncertainty in attributing physical signs to a specific cause without considering a broader differential diagnosis.

However, it does not explain how high flow oxygen alleviates the pain associated with cluster headaches, such as by vasoconstriction or reducing neuronal activity.

2. **Sumatriptan**: The video includes sumatriptan as another treatment option but does not delve into how sumatriptan acts as a serotonin receptor agonist to constrict blood vessels and relieve headache pain.

3. **Intranasal Lidocaine**: While intranasal lidocaine is mentioned, the speaker does not explain its mode of action, which involves numbing the nasal passages to block pain signals","Score: 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially addresses the benefits of treatments for cluster headaches. The speaker mentions high flow oxygen as the treatment of choice and describes its administration (up to 10 liters) until the headache improves. Sumatriptan and intranasal lidocaine (4%) are also mentioned as helpful additional treatments to manage cluster headaches. However, the transcript does not elaborate on the specific benefits of these treatments, such as how they alleviate symptoms, their mechanisms of action, or their effectiveness compared to other treatment options. The benefits are implied by the suggestion to use these treatments, but they are not explicitly discussed.

While the transcript does a commendable job of describing cluster headaches and differentiating them from other types of headaches, the information about the treatment benefits is minimal and lacks detailed explanation. More context on how each treatment option works and its benefits would provide a clearer understanding for viewers. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, as the transcript partially fulfills the criterion of describing","**Score: 1**

The video transcript does not adequately describe the risks of each treatment for cluster headaches. While it extensively details the diagnostic criteria, symptoms, and various distinguishing features of cluster headaches and other types of headaches, it does not delve into the risks associated with the treatments mentioned.

The only treatments specified in the transcript are high-flow oxygen, sumatriptan, and intranasal lidocaine. However, the discussion is limited to their use and effectiveness without any mention of possible adverse effects or contraindications. For instance, while high-flow oxygen is generally considered safe, sumatriptan can have significant side effects, especially in individuals with cardiovascular disease, and repeated use of intranasal lidocaine might carry its own risks. None of these potential risks are discussed.

In a comprehensive medical discussion, understanding both the benefits and risks of treatments is crucial. This transcript focuses primarily on identification and initial management without offering a balanced view that includes the hazards associated with the treatments.

Details regarding the long-term implications, potential side effects, or how these treatments might influence daily activities, emotional well-being, and productivity are not discussed.

To earn a higher score, the video would need to delve into aspects like how effectively different treatments control symptoms over time, their impact on the patient's ability to work or perform daily tasks, and the psychological effects of both the headaches and their treatments. It should also discuss the potential lifestyle modifications or coping strategies that could enhance quality of life alongside medical treatments.

While the primary treatment emphasized for cluster headaches is high-flow oxygen, the speaker also mentions alternative treatments like sumatriptan and intranasal lidocaine, indicating there is more than one treatment option available. This provides a clear indication that different treatment methods exist for managing cluster headaches.

The score is not a perfect 5 because, although multiple treatments are discussed, the discussion leans heavily towards high-flow oxygen as the preferred choice without equally emphasizing other treatments' potential benefits or situational appropriateness. A perfect score would require not only mentioning multiple treatments but also a more balanced discussion on the scenarios or patient specificities that might lead a healthcare provider to choose one treatment over another. Nonetheless, the video does explicitly mention and briefly describe alternative treatments, which justifies a score of 4 for clarity about multiple treatment options being available.","Score: 2

What I'm often aware of is that when we treat someone for one headache condition we will settle that down and another headache condition will leak out and I think what's happened here is we've switched it off and I think you've leaked out into a different type of headache and this headache disturbance looks more like cluster headache which is generally considered to be one of the most horrific pain conditions known. A treatment we use for cluster headache is nerve blocks. Now I know the last nerve block has turned off your hemikranial continua and this other headache condition has now come on in its place. I'm not going to threaten you with that at the moment but I think that's something to consider over the next week or two if we're really having difficulties and not controlling. So keep a diary, keep a very close idea on this and I'll write your prescription for the summa trip down. Cluster headache is notoriously difficult to treat. For now Dr. Silva gives her strong migraine drugs. If this is cluster headache he knows it will come back. It's a week since Helga Christensen last saw Dr. Silva and her headache has come back. Helga Christensen. Hi. Hi. Nice to see you. Come on in, have a seat. I can't move, I can't stand up, I can't sit down, I can't lie down, the light, everything. Have you been through normal childbirth before? Yes. Yeah, so in comparison was childbirth painful? It was but when I'm in full threat to this I would rather have that. Yeah. I know in the past we've done a nerve block and this has happened since a nerve block but one potential would be to try another nerve block procedure and I don't know if you want to do that. Oh. Do you want me to do a nerve block on you now? Yes please do something. I'll just go and get the kit for you. If you just wait a moment I'll go and get something. Helga has had this injection once before. It only offers short-term relief and there's a limit to how many times it can be used. The nerve block is a combination of steroids and local anesthetic that's injected directly into a nerve at the back of her head. So just remind me which side is the pain on? Right. Okay. Dr. Silva must control the immediate pain before he can work out a long-term solution. This isn't just about pain. I mean cluster headache is a hugely debilitating horrific condition. Generally once you have it you will usually have it through your life so there will be spells when you're affected and spells when you're well and for some people they may have it on a regular basis long term so it's a condition that's going to need managing for a long time. It's a week since Helga Christensen had a nerve block injection for a severe headache. She's now having agonizing attacks every day. I'm a bit frightened that it's spiraling a little bit do you know what I mean? I need to find some way of sort of capping it and I know you're trying your best to help me there. Yeah I think we need to get a preventative strategy that has something to work quickly and something that will work a bit more slowly over time that we can build up. For 90% of people a course of steroids will actually turn this off. Right. Very rarely people with steroids go a bit dulally on them and they start getting very depressed or agitated or you know even acting a bit strangely or even psychotic seeing things. If you had anything like that you stop it on that day but it's extremely rare especially in young people. The next thing that we do at the same time is start you on this drug for rapamil. Helga is entering a new phase of treatment. All the drugs they try now have risks attached. None of these drugs are licensed for cluster headache. We don't have drugs that have been studied and studied to the extent where they have a license in the UK. They're getting to the point where I literally would do anything if you if you said anything I would do it try it because I just have to get rid of this acute pain. Bye. The steroids worked for a few weeks but the headaches came back and with them a debilitating paralysis of her right-hand side. She's unable to walk or speak during the attacks and can't leave the house for days at a time. I'm forever the optimist about this and I will beat this. I know I'll beat it eventually and in the meantime I'll just carry on and on the good days I'll do what I'm good at like today and on the bad days curl up in a ball and hibernate and hopefully there'll be more good days than bad days.",Cluster Headache,3,4,4,1,4,3,1,5,3,3,4,4,4,5,4,"Score: 3

Explanation:
The aim of the video appears to be documenting the medical journey and struggles of Helga Christensen with chronic headache conditions and the treatments she is undergoing. The narrative provides a detailed account of her condition, the impact it has on her life, and the various medical interventions being tried by her doctors. This personal story is engaging and informative, particularly for viewers with an interest in chronic pain, neurological disorders, or patient experiences.

However, the video falls short of clearly defining its specific aims right from the outset. It lacks an explicit introduction or summary that would make the purpose of the video evident to all viewers. As a result, one has to infer the aims from the context and progression of events. While the detailed narrative is compelling, the lack of a clear, stated objective at the beginning or a concise wrap-up at the end leaves the viewer to piece together the purpose of the video on their own.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a detailed account of Helga Christensen's struggle with a severe headache disorder, detailing her symptoms, the treatments she has undergone, and their effects. This is relevant to medical professionals, patients with similar conditions, and caregivers seeking to understand the complexities of managing chronic headache disorders, particularly cluster headaches and hemicrania continua.

While the video doesn't delve deeply into the scientific or medical mechanisms behind these conditions or the treatments, it does cover important aspects such as the debilitating nature of these headaches, the treatment options explored, and the challenges in managing them. Dr. Silva’s explanations provide some insight into the complexities involved in treating these types of headaches.

The score is not a perfect 5 because the transcript primarily focuses on a single patient's experience rather than providing a broader overview of headache disorders, their prevalence, or a variety of treatment methods.

The transcript does not provide any clear indication or mention of the sources of information used beyond the experiential narrative given by Helga Christensen and the clinical input from Dr. Silva. While the transcript does detail a personal account of Helga's medical journey with chronic headaches and the interventions she has experienced, it does not reference any external medical literature, studies, or authoritative guidelines.

Furthermore, there is no indication within the transcript suggesting that the content has been compiled or corroborated using additional verified sources. Information such as the description of medical treatments and conditions seems to be based solely on individual accounts rather than supported by broader data or research findings. For instance, statements about the nature of cluster headaches and treatment protocols are attributed to the conversation between the patient and her doctor without referencing medical sources or evidence.

The video does a fairly good job of presenting the timeline and context of Helga Christensen’s medical journey, offering a clear narrative that spans multiple consultations and treatments. It mentions specific events, dates, and procedural steps, such as her first visit to Dr. Silva and the impact of the nerve block injection over several weeks. It references the general timeline (""It's a week since..."" and ""For eight years...""), which helps contextualize the sequence of events and treatments.

However, where the video loses some clarity is in the specificity of when the information was officially recognized or reported. While it provides detailed descriptions and personal testimonials, it lacks a clear indication of exact dates or medical milestones when certain diagnoses or treatments were first introduced or widely recognized. For instance, there's no mention of specific dates for when cluster headaches were identified or when particular medications received notable usage.

Explanation: The video transcript provides a thorough discussion of the potential risks associated with various treatments for Helga's debilitating headaches. For instance, it mentions that the nerve block injections, while offering short-term relief, have limitations in terms of how often they can be administered. Additionally, Dr. Silva explains that treating one type of headache might inadvertently trigger another type of headache, describing this as a ""leak"" from one headache condition to another.

The video also acknowledges that Helga is being prescribed strong migraine drugs and clearly mentions that cluster headaches are notoriously difficult to treat, implying a challenge and risk in managing her pain. Moreover, when steroids are suggested as a part of the treatment plan, Dr. Silva takes the time to explain the rare but possible severe side effects, including depression, agitation, and even psychosis.

However, the video does not explicitly focus on what would happen if no treatment were used. There are a few indirect implications about the severity and debilitating nature of the condition, suggesting that without some form of intervention, her quality of life would severely deteriorate. Helga mentions that her life comes to a standstill due to the pain, indicating that without treatment, her symptoms would continue to dominate her daily existence. Additionally, the doctor's statements underscore the essential role of managing the condition to prevent ongoing or worsening symptoms.

The video provides a fairly comprehensive look into Helga Christensen's experience with her headache conditions and various treatments, covering the impact on her overall quality of life. It specifically mentions that her severe headaches, which include cluster headaches, have greatly restricted her ability to engage in activities she once enjoyed, such as traveling, singing, and dancing. The transcript also details the emotional and mental toll these headaches take on her, describing the excruciating pain and associated helplessness.

Moreover, the video explains the treatments she has received, including nerve block injections and strong migraine drugs, and how these treatments have had mixed results. The nerve block initially exacerbated her condition, indicating that treatment choices can have significant, sometimes negative, impacts on her quality of life.

Explanation: The video transcript clearly indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for Helga Christensen's condition, which involves severe headaches. Several points in the transcript contribute to this:

1. The initial mention of a nerve block injection that was tried but made things worse suggests there are other treatments to consider.
2. Dr. Silva's comments about different headache conditions leaking out and the switch to what looks like cluster headaches indicate the complexity and variability in treatment response.
3. The suggestion from Dr. Silva to keep a diary and consider another nerve block if needed over the next week or two shows that treatment is flexible and adaptive based on patient response.
4. The use of strong migraine drugs as an immediate alternative illustrates another treatment path.

No scientific rationale or evidence is provided to support the efficacy of applying ice, tapping around the eyes, or other described methods. Without this information, viewers are left to simply follow steps without understanding their purpose, which undermines credibility.

Secondly, the repetitive counting and imprecise instruction may not effectively engage viewers or guide them through the process with confidence. For instance, the instruction to ""rub strongly"" and assurances that it won't damage eyes might be misleading or even harmful if viewers misinterpret them.

__vbVjmKHxU,"Hi, I'm Dr. Sonia Lal Gupta. I'm a neurologist practicing out of MP Heart Clinic in GK1 and Metro hospitals in Noida. And today we're going to talk about, you know, a different type of a headache called cluster headaches. Believe it or not, cluster headaches are actually one of the most painful conditions a person can go through. It's almost like having a knife in your eye. And that is the key feature actually of a cluster headache. So if somebody has excruciating pain right in their eye, lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, possibly that could be a cluster headache. Apart from that, you would also have features like watering in your eye, runny nose, redness in your eye. And this headache is so bad that instead of lying down still, people who actually have it are really restless. So what can you do for it? Well, foremost, definitely speak to your doctor. Since there are techniques and medications that you can do that can definitely reduce the pain at that time. What you need to do is, of course, take the right medication in time that will help reduce the pain. And if you have somebody that has frequent cluster headaches, or really seasonal cluster headaches, definitely talk to your doctor regarding prevention. Because being on the right medication, you can actually help avoid these excruciatingly painful headaches. Take care. Bye bye.",Cluster Headache,5,4,5,1,2,3,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,"Score: 5

It occurs due to tenosynovitis caused by inflammation of the tendon sheath surrounding the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The swelling and inflammation prevents the tendon from gliding smoothly through the sheath and thus the finger gets stuck in a bent position and then snaps back into place. Treatment for this condition involves releasing the swollen A1 pulley sheath surrounding the tendons. It is an open procedure in which a small incision is made along the palm to expose the A1 pulley, which is then cut.

iAIzUb4cl4M,"- Trigger finger is a type of tendonitis in the hand, one of the most common that we see. And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position. More commonly, people come because it's sore, and the soreness is what they're looking for treatment of, not so much the actual locking. A treatment for trigger finger, you can try conservative management with taking Motrin, Advil. Occasionally, we'll have people try splinting the finger straight. People report that in the morning, they'll often wake up with their finger bent. And so, we find if they sleep with the finger straight at night, the tendon is not as likely to get caught. But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

YwpB1fi50I4,"- [Narrator] Your forearms contain flexor muscles that allow you to bend your fingers. Long cord-like structures called tendons connect these muscles to the bones in your fingers and thumb. A tunnel of tissue called a tendon sheath surrounds each tendon. This allows the tendon to glide smoothly as the fingers move. The sheath is held in place by bands of tissue called pulleys. They hold the tendon close to the bone for optimal functioning of the tendon. When your flexor muscles contract, the pulleys help guide the tendons to flex or bend your fingers. Normally, the tendons glide smoothly through the pulleys when the fingers flex and extend. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where the pulley at the base of your finger becomes inflamed and swollen. This makes it harder for the tendon to move through the pulley. Over time, the tendon may also swell and form a bump near the pulley. When you bend your finger, the swollen area on the tendon may cause a catching or triggering sensation as it initially gets hung on the pulley and then slips underneath. If not treated, the tendon may swell enough that it cannot pass beneath the pulley. As a result, your finger may get stuck in a bent position. If you have trigger finger, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: a tender lump on your palm at the base of your finger. A catching, popping or locking sensation when you move your finger. And pain when you bend or straighten your finger. The cause of trigger finger isn't known but some conditions that can increase your risk for it include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and repeated injuries, forceful and repetitive hand gripping may also increase your risk. To treat mild trigger finger, your doctor may advise you to rest your hand and avoid activities that make it worse. Your doctor may prescribe antiinflammatory medication or a corticosteroid injection to reduce the swelling. You may also need to wear a finger splint to keep your finger straight. If non-surgical treatments haven't worked, your doctor may advise you to have a surgical procedure. To start the procedure, your surgeon will make a small incision in your palm. Then the pulley will be cut to free the tendon. At the end of the procedure, your incision may be closed with stitches and covered with a soft bandage.

**Explanation:**
The video partially achieves its aims. The video seems to have a dual purpose: demonstrating the ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) technique and promoting ASTR training and services. 

1. **Demonstration of Technique:** The video successfully showcases a practical demonstration of the ASTR technique being applied to a patient suffering from trigger finger. The immediate results observed post-treatment provide compelling evidence of the technique's effectiveness. This part of the video achieves its aim well by giving a realistic overview of the application and potential benefits of ASTR.

2. **Promotion of ASTR Training:** The video also attempts to promote ASTR training classes for healthcare providers. It highlights the ease and effectiveness of the technique, even after just three days of training. However, the promotional aspect feels somewhat forced and undermines the educational content. The repeated encouragement to subscribe and register for classes, while necessary for promotion, detracts from the instructional and informative nature of the video.

Ej8FwzKnmHo,"Trigger finger and trigger thumb. Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured. When releasing the A1 poly, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The A2 and A4 polys are important structures and should not be touched, excised or released. Only A1 poly is cut and released and the flexor tendon is released. Surgical release. How do you release the A1 poly? The procedure is done with local anesthesia to allow intraoperative assessment and to communicate with the patient to confirm that adequate release was done. Here there is a surgical case. The incision is marked out in the palmar crease for surgical division of the A1 poly. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery and the fingers are usually marked on the palmar aspect and the dorsal aspect. The A1 poly is exposed and released. Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis. How about trigger thumb? This is the incision for the surgical release of trigger thumb. The incision for trigger thumb is placed in the MP flexion crease. When releasing the flexor pollicis longus tendon, watch out for the digital radion nerve. It's in the field of surgery. Thank you very much. I hope that was helpful.

EAzo4iF4dv0,"Hi, this is Dr. Levi here at Glendale Outpatient Surgery Center with another one of our really wonderful instructional videos. So today we'll be talking about trigger finger also called stenosyptinosynovitis. A patient will present with one of their fingers locked in this position. This happens and occurs because the A1 pulley or the flexor tendon sheath, there's edema and fibrosis in this area causing the tendon to be trapped under the A1 pulley and they're unable to extend the thumb completely. It'll flex down but they cannot extend it. Now this can occur with any of the fingers. Why people develop trigger finger, no one knows why exactly. However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane. Both of these work very effective. The Kenalog is a steroid and the Markane is the analgesic. So with that said, if the steroid injection is not effective, then the last treatment modality would be surgical intervention which would be release of the A1 pulley. It's a very, very effective surgical procedure. It takes approximately three to five minutes to do properly and it's quite effective for most patients. Let's talk about some lifestyle change that you may want to consider if you have trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. Exercise every day. Stay healthy. Drink more water. Eat more fruits, nuts, vegetables and grains. Of course, attempt to do those stretching exercises that I showed you at least two or three times a day. These are things that I think can help you on your journey if you have and if you develop trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis.",Trigger Finger,5,4,5,1,4,4,1,4,3,3,2,1,3,5,2,"Score: 5

DISCFr0YeiM,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. Usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",Trigger Finger,5,5,5,1,4,4,1,1,5,2,1,1,1,1,2,"Score: 5

_DVTsOZREPY,"Trigger finger, or stenosing tinnocinnovitis, is a common condition seen by hand surgeons. It's caused by swelling in the flexor tendons, which bend your fingers into your palm. Sometimes, if the tendon is too swollen, it can cause the finger to get stuck and be very painful when you try and straighten it. Trigger finger can occur after a period of overuse, but can also have an insidious onset without a history of overuse injury of the hands. It occurs because the flexor tendons at the base of your finger enter a series of pulleys, or tunnels, and the swollen tendon can get caught on the edge of the tunnel as you bend and straighten your finger. When the swollen tendon gets stuck on one side of the tunnel, patients often have to force their finger straight, which can be very painful. It is common for catching or locking of the digit to be worse at night or in the morning while the tendon is more swollen. This is because when you sleep at night, tendons tend to swell a little bit more, and the swelling may resolve throughout the day, causing less catching or locking of your fingers. Trigger finger is very common. It is associated with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis. However, trigger finger occurs frequently in patients without a history of these conditions. Typically, there are four stages of a trigger finger. Initially, the patient may have tenderness to palpation at the base of their finger at the level of the first pulley or entrance to the tunnel. Next, the patient may notice that their finger has a catching sensation as they flex and extend their finger. Third, the patient may experience locking of the finger, where they have to manually straighten their finger, and this is usually associated with a painful pop. Finally, when the inflammation is very severe, the finger will remain fixed and locked in an extended position. At this point, it is often too painful for the patient to bend their finger into their palm. If you begin to experience symptoms similar to a trigger finger, you can first try at-home care by resting, icing, and stretching the finger. Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or aspirin may also help reduce pain. If your pain won't go away or gets worse, then it may be time to make an appointment with a hand surgeon to be properly diagnosed. Often, trigger finger can be treated successfully without surgery. The typical first line of treatment is a steroid injection to the affected finger. The injection decreases the amount of inflammation within the tendon, therefore allowing the tendon to glide more smoothly through the tunnel. Generally, two out of three patients will have a successful result from the steroid injection, and no further treatment may be necessary. Sometimes, the steroid injection may last for several months, and another steroid injection can be administered to the area as symptoms recur. If the finger continues to trigger after two to three steroid injections, or if the injection does not provide long-lasting relief, your surgeon may recommend surgical release of the A1 pulley. Surgery involves cutting the roof of the tunnel, which allows the tendon to glide more smoothly. A trigger finger release can typically be performed under just local anesthetic, with minimal discomfort following surgery.",Trigger Finger,5,5,5,1,4,5,1,1,4,5,3,2,3,5,3,"Score: 5

FyUzORrK75g,"Let's take a look at trigger finger surgery. Trigger finger is one of the most common conditions that a hand surgeon treats. Of course, most commonly from frequent keyboard use, as you can see here, frequent texting, anything repetitive that causes the fingers or thumbs to move can cause this problem. As you can see here, this is the actual, it's a painful triggering condition where the finger snaps back and forth. The ring finger is most common but can occur in any digit. Now let's take a look at an animated anatomical picture here. The blue structures are the flexor tendons. There's two to each finger and one to the thumb. And they go through a little, these white bands, what we call pulleys. And it's within these bands that you get the mechanical advantage to be able to bend the fingers into the palm. As you can see from this picture, the fingers are being bent into the palm. And now as we straighten, you can see, again, the tendons are moving back and forth. Now what happens is from repetitive use, you get a little nodule that forms in the palm on one of the tendons. And that nodule becomes larger over time from repeated friction. And much like a little knot in a rope trying to go through a pulley, this nodule starts ramming into the flexor sheath or pulley system. And it actually can grate back and forth causing this popping of the joint just beyond that, or the middle joint in the finger. In severe cases, the finger can actually become locked straight. But more commonly, it's locked in a bent position. Now initially when the patient comes in, we will do a cortisone shot, effective in about 50% of cases. But you will see from an animated video here, we'll actually show you the surgical procedure. We make a little cut, local anesthetic, about a five minute outpatient procedure, a little light sedation. We actually cut the band that's impeding the tendon. And we open that up. That allows the finger to bend. We place several sutures, two or three, four sutures in place, and a little light dressing. Now an actual picture or video of a patient undergoing this procedure, you can see here, putting the scissors right underneath this white structure here. The retractors are in place. We're snipping with the scissors, that band. You can see a great picture here of that actual opening up of that band. In this case of this patient, she had no flexion. Upon releasing her tendon immediately, once we awakened her during the procedure, she could bend the thumb. So after the procedure, it's about 10 days with a little light dressing or band aid over the incision. You're moving it right away. Sutures come out 10 days later. And then it's about a four week total recovery, just because it's a sensitive skin to place a cut on the hand. So it's about four weeks, give or take, for all the soreness to go away. But activity is tolerated. Now, there's very little chance of recurrence with this condition. But what you will see, it'll pop up in other fingers over time. One is several months later, just from using the other hand or the same hand, you can get repetitive motion. And another one comes up.

Explanation:
The video does not explicitly mention the dates or timeframes when the presented information or data were produced. Although it discusses the procedure for treating trigger finger and provides an animated and live depiction of the surgical process, there is no clear reference to when the provided information was compiled or whether this reflects the latest advancements. This lack of temporal context makes it challenging to ascertain whether the surgical methods or success rates are based on the most current medical standards and research or are potentially outdated. While the detailed explanation of the surgical procedure and recovery is informative, the absence of any date stamps or references to recent studies or treatment guidelines reduces the clarity regarding the currency of the reported information.

Explanation: 

The video provides a detailed and thorough description of trigger finger, including its causes, symptoms, and treatment options, with a focus on surgical intervention. The use of both animated anatomical pictures and real patient video enhances understanding, making the content accessible and educational. However, the primary focus of the content is on surgical treatment, making it somewhat imbalanced.

While the video does mention cortisone shots as an initial treatment, it doesn't explore non-surgical alternatives in-depth. Other conservative treatment options like splinting, physical therapy, or lifestyle modifications are not discussed, which could be relevant for patients looking for comprehensive treatment information. This oversight may lead viewers to perceive surgery as the predominantly recommended treatment, potentially biasing the information.

Furthermore, the video concludes with a promotional message for the Hand and Wrist Institute, which introduces a potential bias towards promoting their services rather than offering purely educational content.

Explanation: The video transcript primarily focuses on explaining the condition of trigger finger and the surgical procedure used to treat it. It provides detailed anatomical descriptions, discusses the etiology (repetitive use leading to nodule formation), common clinical presentations, and outlines both conservative (cortisone shots) and surgical treatment options. However, there is minimal discussion regarding uncertainties. The closest the video comes to addressing uncertainty is when it mentions the effectiveness of cortisone shots being about 50% and the slight chance of recurrence in the same or different fingers. However, it doesn't delve into the reasons behind these statistics, nor does it discuss any ongoing debates or areas of medical ambiguity regarding the condition or its treatment. Overall, the transcript is confident and informative but lacks a focused discussion on areas of uncertainty, earning it a score of 2.","Score: 4

Explanation: The transcript provides a comprehensive overview of both non-surgical and surgical treatments for trigger finger. It describes the condition, including the anatomy and the mechanical issues leading to the problem. The video discusses the initial non-surgical treatment option, a cortisone shot, mentioning its efficacy rate. It then delves into the surgical procedure in great detail, explaining each step—making an incision, cutting the problematic band, and suturing—alongside both an animated depiction and a real-life example. This thorough explanation enables viewers to understand how the surgical treatment works.

However, the transcript could be enhanced by providing more detailed mechanisms of how cortisone shots alleviate the condition. For example, mentioning how cortisone reduces inflammation and relieves pain might improve the completeness.

0VSxtk1oQ2s,"Hey everyone, Dr. McClellan. I wanted to show you a great video that I took on trigger finger injection. Learning how to inject a trigger finger well is an important part of just routine clinic in plastic surgery or hand surgery. And I wanted to show you how I do it. It may be different than the way that you do it and hopefully a couple of the tips are helpful for you. I'll put up here, I've never done it before, but I'll try to put right there an article from Journal of Hand Surgery showing trigger finger is very effective at relieving initial symptoms of trigger finger with a little steroid shot of Kenalog 40 and some lidocaine. I like to stay right in the middle of the finger so that you're not near the nerve-vascular bundle which tend to be in the sulcus along the side of the tendons. So if you stay right over the tendon, you're pretty safe. I'll show you how to get the tendon into the right plane and I'll show you on a schematic where that plane is. And some of the tips that I do that I think gives me good steroid injections and prevents other complications. I tend to mix Kenalog 40 and lidocaine together. I use the lidocaine as kind of a diagnostic if the pain goes away of the node-as-node going under the A1 pulley, then generally the steroid is in the right place and they will get relief in a couple of weeks. As always, I hope you like the video. If you like it, give it a thumbs up, share the video and thanks so much for watching. Have a great day. Okay. So let's say this is your tendon and here is your pulley. The space where you want to be is right in here, okay, between the pulley and the tendon. That's where you want to deliver the steroid. So if you bring your needle in, okay, and the needle point goes into the tendon, when you wiggle the finger, this needle will move back and forth and that way you can tell that you're in the tendon. And so then what you do is you simply back up a little bit, okay, and until the tendon stops or until the needle stops moving with the tendon and then you gently press down on the plunger and you can get the steroid and local anesthetic right into that space which is where you want to be. So lidocaine plane, Kinlog, O1CC syringe. I like a larger needle to draw it up and then like a 27 to inject it. And I do not push it out of the end until I'm ready to inject because it'll clot the needle off. Okay, we're doing middle finger and ring finger, correct? Okay Rachel, let's see if you can come more over it. Okay, and he clicks right there. You can feel it and right there. So sir, what I'm going to do is go in with the needle and then I'll talk to you as I do it, okay? Okay. So now when I'm ready to go in, I will squirt out a little bit, okay? And I'm going to come down right in the middle of the finger. Stick? Are you okay? Mm-hmm. So I come down, wiggle the tip of your finger a little bit. See it moving? Okay, so that's too far. So I'm going to back off of that a little bit and I'm going to just really easily push it in. And it should go in nice and easy. And I do about 0.4, okay? I'm going to come over to this side. Go in, about right there. Stick. Wiggle the tip of your finger. So that's not in yet. I'm going to go in a little bit further and then I felt it right there.

aSt5GuiIGf8,"I'm Dr. Arnold Batson. We're here in the operating room at St. Francis Eastside Surgery Center. We have a patient that has triggering of her index and long fingers. This lady has a trigger finger of both her index and her long fingers today. That means that the fingers, when she closes them down, sometimes stick and won't open very well and sometimes even have to be pried open. We're going to make a small incision, go into the flexor tendon sheath that gets tied around the tendons and release the tendon sheath so that the rough part of the tendon can slide through that again without causing the locking or the catching. We're preparing to do the surgery now. This lady's been prepped with disinfectant for the skin. I've marked where we're going to make the proposed incision and she's already numb and anesthetized. So making the incision, get some little bit of bleeding from some little small vessels, then some spreading to get down to the tendon sheath. This is the tendon sheath, the white structure that's running through there. I know it's in a hole and it may be difficult to see, but that's the band that we're going to cut. Okay, we've made a small incision in the sheath. Now we're going to enlarge that or lengthen it a bit. When you're doing this operation, you have to watch out for the little small nerves that run on either side of the tendon and tendon sheath and protect those. We've just opened the tendon sheath and now we're lifting the tendons up out of the bed that they sit in. You may be able to see them move as we move the finger. Here's the split area or the little frayed area that binds or catches as the tendon slides through the sheath. We just do a little touch-up smoothing that. That ensures that it glides well inside. Now the sheath's been released. The tendon can move well through there. So that one is fixed now. This one is similar. It may be even more difficult to see from the angle that the camera's positioned. This is the tendon sheath, again the whitish structure that's in there, and making a little small opening into it. These tendons look like they're going to be pretty frayed also when we get them out to take a look at them. Okay. One of the tendons looks pretty good. It's nice and smooth, but there's a lot of fraying in this little bit of splitting in the other tendon that's likely the cause of the problems in this one. There's the reddish streak. There's the split in the tendon that's probably the cause of the locking and catching with this one. The problem with this is a degenerative wear and tear of the tendons. It's a little worse than people that have diabetes for some reason, but it occurs in almost everyone to some, all professions and all sexes, both male and female, have problems with this. So this one's completed now. It's back in its little sheath and sliding well through there. So now we're ready to close up the incision. We'll wash it out. And for these we use some little small absorbable buried stitches and then cover the wound or the incision with Dermabond or Surgeseal or another type of surgical adhesive so that the patient can usually start washing the hand or taking a shower in about 48 hours. The procedure does make the fingers sore and stiff for a few days and normally I would tell most patients that it takes around two to two and a half weeks to pretty well recover from this altogether. Here. This type of incision causes very little scarring. Even though this one is four centimeters or so long, the palm heals very nicely and makes very little scar as opposed to incisions elsewhere on the body where the scarring is much more obvious. We've gotten the incision closed now, so we're going to put a local anesthetic in that will keep this numb for the next three or four hours before the feeling all comes back so that the patient doesn't leave here having some burning or stinging in the area. Okay, we just applied the surgical adhesive or the substance that's going to keep this sealed and snug together for the next several days. We've finished the procedure now. Dressings are applied and from here the patient's going to go to the recovery room for a few minutes. Probably in 30 minutes or 45 minutes she'll be ready to leave and go home. In about 48 hours she can remove the dressing and then she can go to the in about 48 hours she can remove the dressings and begin rinsing her hand in running water, taking a shower, but not submerging it in bath water or dish water for several days. She can use her fingers. They'll be a little tender or sore at first, but fairly quickly she can get back to normal usage. I'll see her back in the office in nine or ten days and make sure everything's healing well. And frequently for this procedure that's the only time that I need to see the patient back. If they're having any particular problems getting the movement or getting their fingers closed completely down into a clenched fist, I will see them again in another two or three weeks to make sure that they've fully recovered that.

0MckpiWxrN4,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb it's a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteries. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. At this time I'm cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient has had a very long standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thin fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",Trigger Finger,4,4,4,1,3,4,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,"Score: 4

Tt1-_eNMC9Y,"Hello, this is Dr. Janusz. This next video is going to be a trigger finger release. We're going to be releasing the A1 pulley of this patient's finger, which is what causes the trigger. The surgery, as usual, starts with the marking of my incision with a skin marker. Here you'll see I'm palpating the A1 pulley. You can feel this in your own hand as the pea-sized knot right in this location. People who have trigger fingers, this is often enlarged and extremely tender. You actually have several options in this particular incision. You can do a diagonal incision, you can do a straight on incision, and some people do one that is transversely across the palm. Testing the anesthesia with some forceps, making sure that the patient is comfortable, and the skin incision is made with a 15 blade scalpel. As in with most of the other surgeries that you'll be watching, there are always important structures immediately below the skin, especially in the hand. You have to be very careful when making a decision not to plunge deep down into those structures, and therefore we proceed nice and slow, dissecting down and identifying nerves and arteries that need to be preserved. The dissection is taken down through to the A1 pulley, and as I encounter any small blood vessels, those are cauterized with bipolar cauterine. Using scissors to gently spread down to the A1 pulley, I'm being careful to protect the digital nerves and arteries. This is a trigger finger retractor, which you see just go in. Now I'm getting a few final bands of fibrous tissue off of the A1 pulley, so that I can see the pulley clearly and divide it. The camera is showing an excellent view of the A1 pulley. It's the white structure that I'm pointing at now with my freer elevator. You can also see, if you look closely, the white line between the pulley and the tendon, which is slightly more yellow. Right there is the end of the pulley. The pulley is then divided longitudinally. Here I'm using a beaver blade to start the cut, and then I will come back in with some littler scissors and finish that. You're now seeing the flexor tendon, which is nicely displayed after the A1 pulley is retracted off of it. I'm then using some scissors to just gently push away the leaflets of the A1 pulley. Now I'm picking up the pulley with my forceps to demonstrate the anatomy. The digital nerves and arteries are just on the outside of this. I also use a retractor to pick up both flexor tendons to the finger and make sure that there's no fibrous connection between them. There's often quite a bit of scarring between both tendons and somebody who has a severe A1 pulley disease, and I like to break up those adhesions prior to finishing the surgery. This patient's finger is nice and smooth and the triggering is gone. Oftentimes the patient will be awake during this and just under local anesthetic. In those situations we can actually ask the patient to move their finger and demonstrate that the triggering is now gone. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and now we're going to be closing this with some nylon sutures. I'm going to be using a horizontal mattress technique. These sutures are usually left in for eight days. We allow the patient to take down their dressing at day four and cover these with a band-aid. The patient in the recovery room starts doing some exercises immediately, keeping the finger moving, and is asked to make fists at least 10 times an hour until follow-up. Some zero form dressing is then applied over the wound and that's the end of this trigger finger release. Hope you enjoyed it.

iqw1TDyzvjo,"I began to perform percutaneous releases of trigger fingers about 35 years ago as a technique to release remaining bands following an open procedure without another operation. This was soon adapted to initial procedures. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be done in an office setting effectively with minimal morbidity. After the first presentation at a national meeting, there was a general reluctance to perform the procedure. This continues until the present time and appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves. The procedure has evolved over the past 35 years. This short video will demonstrate the procedure with emphasis on safety and effectiveness. The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique. The vertical orientation of the needle tip is also maintained by identifying the position of the syringe with a needle in the vertical position before insertion. This technique I have dubbed the Pressure Push Method. Specifically placing the needle point underneath the flexor tendon sheath is avoided to avoid cutting the flexor tendon. Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy.

Explanation:

The transcript of the video provides a detailed explanation of the percutaneous release of trigger fingers procedure. It covers the history and evolution of the procedure, the environment in which it's performed, and the specific steps involved in conducting the procedure. However, while the description is thorough, it does not completely explain the underlying mechanisms of all the mentioned treatments.

To elaborate, the video does a good job describing how the percutaneous release procedure itself is carried out, and it discusses the tools and techniques used, such as the use of a 16 gauge needle for the release and a 30 gauge needle for anesthetic injection. The transcript also explains the palpation techniques to determine the success of the procedure and to avoid damage to the tendons.

However, the explanation of other treatment options like intrathecal steroid injection and open release remains somewhat superficial. There is no detailed description of how these other treatments specifically work at a physiological level or their mechanisms of action. For instance, the","Score: 3

Explanation: The transcript provides an in-depth, technical explanation of the percutaneous release procedure for treating trigger fingers. It highlights some benefits, such as the procedure being performed in an office setting with minimal morbidity and a quicker recovery allowing patients to resume activities like playing golf shortly after. Additionally, it briefly touches on the reduced chance of tendon damage if the procedure is done correctly. However, the transcript does not comprehensively address the benefits of each possible treatment, such as intrathecal steroid injections or open surgical releases, nor does it discuss alternative treatments and their respective advantages.

The focus is heavily weighted towards the procedure itself, its evolution, and the technical aspects rather than an explicit comparison of benefits between various treatments. While it mentions some criteria for choosing intrathecal injections or open procedures over percutaneous release, the transcript lacks a detailed discussion on the benefits of these treatments relative to each other. Therefore, the video partially addresses the benefits of different treatments, warranting a score of ","Score: 3

Explanation: 

The video transcript does mention some risks associated with the percutaneous release procedure, but it does so in a somewhat indirect and incomplete manner. The primary concerns of tendon and nerve damage are noted as reasons for reluctance in adopting the procedure (""appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves""). This indicates awareness of potential procedural risks. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive or structured discussion of the risks associated with each treatment option in detail. 

The transcript also briefly mentions another complication, reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome, as occurring in a handful of patients, which required additional hand therapy. Additionally, side effects like discomfort for a week and longer-lasting pain in some cases are mentioned.

Despite these mentions, the video does not thoroughly address all potential risks nor does it compare the risks between percutaneous procedures and other treatment options comprehensively. There is also no mention of other standard risks like infection, bleeding,","Score: 1

Explanation: 
The video transcript primarily focuses on the percutaneous release procedure for trigger fingers, detailing the steps, techniques, and considerations involved in performing the surgery. It mentions advantages, such as the ability to do it in an office setting with minimal morbidity, and addresses how the technique has evolved over time. The explanation is very procedural and precise, focusing on how to safely and effectively perform the release, the role of injected anesthetics, and aftercare instructions, but it does not discuss the consequences of foregoing treatment in any explicit manner.

While the detailed description of the procedure might provide an astute viewer with some indirect insight into the potential challenges and issues associated with untreated trigger fingers (e.g., persistence of triggering or pain that necessitates intervention), this is not explicitly addressed. It lacks an explanation or discussion on what patients might experience if they choose not to receive surgical or any other treatment.

Explanation:
The video primarily focuses on the technical aspects and procedural details of performing percutaneous releases of trigger fingers, including the steps for ensuring safety and effectiveness during the surgery. While it does mention that the advantage of the procedure is it can be done in an office setting with minimal morbidity and provides some anecdotal evidence about the recovery time (e.g., patients resuming golf the following day), it does not sufficiently address the overall impact on the patient's quality of life. 

The narrative lacks a thorough discussion on how the treatment choices might influence long-term outcomes, daily functioning, psychological well-being, or broader aspects of the patient's life. Although brief statements like ""most patients do better than those with an open procedure"" hint at improved recovery experiences, the transcript falls short of a comprehensive evaluation of quality of life, such as the comparison of different treatment options (surgical vs. non-surgical) and their implications on the patient's physical, emotional, and social well-being over time.","I would rate the clarity of the video as 4.

The video is quite comprehensive in describing the percutaneous release procedure for trigger finger and mentions alternative treatments at certain points. For instance, it talks about intrathecal steroid injections as the preferred management when there is a history of triggering alongside recurrent pain but no physical confirmation of triggering. Moreover, it mentions the use of ultrasound to identify indications for an open release surgery when intrathecal injections fail. 

However, the focus of the video heavily leans towards the percutaneous release method, detailing it thoroughly while comparatively giving less attention to alternative methods. While it does mention other treatments, such as intrathecal steroid injections and open release surgery, it doesn’t delve deeply into when and why one might choose these alternatives over percutaneous release, nor does it discuss other potential treatment options for trigger finger (like non-surgical interventions, physical therapy, etc.). 

Therefore, while the video does acknowledge that multiple treatment choices exist, it primarily emphasizes one method","Score: 2

The video transcript appears to provide detailed information on the percutaneous release of trigger fingers, focusing extensively on the procedural aspects, including step-by-step instructions on performing the technique. It does emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the procedure, highlighting its advantages, such as being minimally invasive and suitable for an office setting.

However, the transcript does not sufficiently support shared decision-making. Shared decision-making involves the collaboration between patients and healthcare providers to make healthcare decisions that consider both clinical evidence and the patient's preferences, values, and unique circumstances. This transcript focuses almost exclusively on the technical procedural content without considering patient preferences, alternative treatment options, or the communication necessary to engage patients in the decision-making process.

There is a brief mention of alternative management (intrathecal steroid injection and open release) based on specific conditions identified during physical examination, but this is presented from a clinician-centric perspective without involving the patient in the decision-making process.

FrQpFy7grtY,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",Trigger Finger,5,4,5,1,4,5,1,1,4,2,1,1,2,1,2,"**Score: 5**

The focus of the video is primarily on demonstrating the condition of trigger thumb and describing the procedure of injecting steroids into the affected area. While the transcript does mention that the injection will involve steroids and suggests using a single injection to minimize discomfort, there is no explicit discussion on the expected benefits or outcomes of the treatment. 

The transcript could be improved by including details about how the steroid injection is expected to alleviate symptoms such as pain or snapping, how effective this treatment is typically, and any additional benefits related to using vapor coolant or minimizing needle sticks. Without this information, the viewer is left with an understanding of the procedure but no clear knowledge of its advantages or effectiveness. Thus, the score is close to 'no' but slightly better because it at least identifies the intended treatment, which is why it receives a 2.","**Score: 1**

The video transcript does not describe the risks of the treatment discussed. The content focuses on demonstrating a trigger thumb condition, explaining the procedure for a steroid injection, and providing some details about the type of medication and method used. However, there is a complete lack of information regarding the potential risks or side effects associated with the steroid injection or the use of lidocaine and vapor coolant. 

For a video to properly address the risks of each treatment, it should include details such as possible complications, side effects, contraindications, and what patients should watch out for post-treatment. This ensures that the patient is fully informed before undergoing the procedure, adhering to the principle of informed consent in medical practice.

There is no mention of the potential benefits or side effects of the steroid injection, any long-term outcomes, or how the treatment might help the patient regain normal daily function and improve their overall well-being. The information strictly remains at the level of symptom demonstration and step-by-step procedural narration, lacking the broader context necessary to inform viewers about the implications of the treatment on quality of life.","Score: 1

Explanation:
The transcript exclusively highlights a single treatment option for trigger thumb, specifically the injection of steroids with the aid of a vapor coolant to ease the process. It does not mention any other possible treatment choices, such as non-invasive methods (e.g., splinting, occupational therapy), alternative medications, or potential surgical interventions, which can be necessary for some patients. 

The expert demonstrating the procedure focuses solely on the specifics of administering the steroid injection, including the dosage and steps involved. The patient interaction is also centered merely on confirming and executing this single treatment method without discussing alternative routes or potential follow-ups. Therefore, there's no indication that a broader array of treatment choices exists, leaving viewers uninformed about other possible approaches or the context in which steroid injections might be chosen over other options.

Thus, this video is not clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice, resulting in a low score of 1.","Score: 2

Explanation: 

The video transcript demonstrates a clinical scenario involving a patient with trigger thumb and the administration of a steroid injection as treatment. While it provides some basic interaction between the patient and the healthcare provider, it lacks significant aspects of shared decision-making.

Shared decision-making involves discussing the pros and cons of different treatment options, considering the patient's preferences and values, and allowing the patient to participate actively in their healthcare decisions. In this transcript:

1. The provider asks the patient about the duration of her symptoms, which is a positive step in understanding the patient's condition.
2. The patient is informed about the planned treatment (steroid injection) and the healthcare provider mentions using lidocaine and a vapor coolant to minimize discomfort.

However, the transcript does not:

9RO2LJKVQZo,"This is Rashara Dages discussing today a trigger thumb or A1 pulley release. Here we're making our transverse incision here in the flexor crease along the area of the A1 pulley. Care is taken with our incision to ensure that we only go just deep enough to get to the subcutaneous tissue. This is to ensure that we do not injure the radial neurovascular bundle. Using small double hooks, we're able to dissect with care taken again to remove the tissue but get down to the flexor tendon sheath. The pulley is now identified and an attempt is made to identify the radial nerve and neurovascular structures. You can see the nerve there. So a crowd retractor is then placed in to retract the nerve. Here you can see the pulley and you can see the proximal edge of the pulley is illustrated here by our scissor. We will use a knife to incise the proximal edge extending distally. Here we can see the pulley begin to open. We then use a tonotomy scissor to complete the release distally. Care is taken again not to injure the tendon or disrupt the neurovascular bundle and now proximally the release is completed as well. The pulley leaflets are easily identified and they're easy to note complete release because of the redundancy that is now in the leaflets. Any residual catching or triggering which is noted with active flexion is then released. Here again we can see smooth motion of the tendon itself and now the skin is closed using a 3-0 nylon suture. Two mattress sutures typically take care of the closure. Soft dressing is in place and patient is allowed active motion of the IP joint immediately. Sutures are removed typically in 10 to 14 days and from that point activity is unrestricted.",Trigger Finger,4,4,3,1,3,3,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,1,2,"**Score: 4**

m0Wu6rd9ItA,"In mild cases of trigger finger, anti-inflammatory medication may be helpful. However, usually the standard for conservative treatment is a cortisone shot directly into the tendon to reduce inflammation. Within three to five days, you should know if this is going to be successful. However, if conservative treatment fails, a surgical option is a quick, simple procedure where the band overlying the tendon is snipped, thereby relieving pressure on the tendon and relieving the problem. With trigger finger surgery, a one centimeter incision is made after IV sedation is administered in the operating room and a local anesthetic. After a tiny incision here in the palm, a small band is clipped, relieving pressure on the tendon. Within minutes, you are asked to actively flex and extend the fingers, assuring there is no further popping at that time. Then you are taken to the recovery room and within 30 minutes to an hour, you are on your way home. The recovery following trigger finger surgery is rapid, usually returning to full movement within several days and full activities within several weeks. You may have persistent pain or soreness where the cut is across the palm for up to six weeks. After trigger finger surgery, it is very unusual to have a recurrence and is one of the few problems in the hand that actually usually does not recur after surgery.

The spreading is done along the long axis of the digit with care not to injure any neurovascular structures. A superficial palmar fascia is released and the A1 pulley is then identified. Once the pulley is identified it is incised and opened. Depending on the nature of the tendon nodule, a portion of the pulley may be removed or a synonym around the tendon may be resected as well. A complete release of the A1 pulley is accomplished. The finger is checked for triggering. The fondness of the tendon is also looked at to be sure there is no nodularity associated. In this case there was extra synonym around the tendon and this was removed. The wound is enclosed with floral monofilament usually in a mattress fashion to divert the skin edges. The patient is placed in a light dressing without splinting and is encouraged to move from day 1.

Explanation:
The aims of the video are relatively clear, as indicated by the detailed transcript of the A1 pulley release procedure. David Drake outlines the typical incision technique for treating trigger finger, the steps involved in the surgical procedure, and post-operative care. Specific details such as incision size, techniques used to avoid neurovascular damage, identification and treatment of the A1 pulley, and post-operative instructions are meticulously described. This suggests that the video is aimed at educating viewers, likely medical professionals or students, about the detailed procedural steps and considerations for an A1 pulley release.

However, there are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For example, while the transcript explains the procedural steps in detail, it does not explicitly state the primary educational goal at the beginning or end of the video. The context background or brief introduction about trigger finger or the importance of the procedure is also missing, which might leave some viewers uncertain about the overall purpose of the video until they watch it fully.

This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping. Because then when you wake up, you may notice, oh, no, it's back to where it was. When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area. If you want to try the oval eight splint to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger, I think this could help you. Four to six weeks is going to be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your finger. And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities.

c0X9E9AeSUQ,"By the end of this video you're going to learn how to fix trigger finger in about five minutes. My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that. The problem is that has a very poor success rate for the most part. The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back. So it's not the greatest solution. You want to get to this problem earlier. The sooner you can treat it with Graston, the sooner you can treat it with stretching and the sooner you can get that brace and splint on your finger, the better off you're going to be.

It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the surgical process, including making the incision, identifying and preserving the flexor tendon and nerve, and post-operative care. 

However, the video lacks balance and appears somewhat biased due to the following reasons:

1. **Omission of Alternatives**: The transcript focuses exclusively on the surgical method described by the presenter without mentioning any alternative treatments or methods for this condition, such as non-surgical therapies or different surgical techniques. 

2. **Lack of Discussion on Risks and Complications**: The transcript does not discuss any potential risks, complications, or variability in outcomes associated with the procedure. An unbiased review should include potential adverse outcomes to provide a comprehensive understanding.

Explanation:
The video transcript provides a detailed description of the surgical procedure for an A1 pulley release on the thumb. It covers the steps of the surgery, the anatomical considerations, and post-operative instructions for the patient. However, it does not provide any additional sources of support or information beyond the description of the procedure itself.

There is no mention of supplementary educational materials, such as websites, articles, or books where viewers can learn more about the condition, the surgical procedure, or post-operative care. Furthermore, the transcript does not refer to any professional organizations, support groups, or helplines where patients can seek further advice or connect with others who have undergone the same procedure. 

For these reasons, the video transcript scores a 1 on the question of whether it provides details of additional sources of support and information. The content is informative regarding the procedure but lacks external resources that can guide viewers to further assistance or expanded knowledge.","Score: 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The video transcript partially refers to areas of uncertainty, meriting a score of 3. The explicit mention that the decision to excise a portion of the sheath ""depends on the nature of the sheath and the construction"" indicates some variability and clinician discretion in treatment, which is an area of uncertainty in practice. Specifically, the statement ""I don't always do that"" suggests that the procedure could vary depending on the specific characteristics of the patient's sheath. This variability implies that there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach and that the surgeon's assessment during the procedure plays a crucial role.

However, the transcript lacks broader contextual discussion about potential uncertainties, risks, or decision-making challenges associated with A1 pulley release surgeries. There isn't much elaboration on how different anatomical variations or patient conditions could impact surgical decisions or outcomes. Moreover, no mention is made of alternative techniques, potential complications, or uncertainties in postoperative recovery.

Explanation: 
The video transcript provides a fairly detailed description of the A1 pulley release surgery for the thumb. The procedure is described step-by-step, beginning with the marking and making of the incision, identifying and avoiding critical structures like the nerve and flexor tendon, and concluding with the excision of a portion of the sheath if necessary. Specific details about the nature of the tissue, the tools used (such as the 15 blade), and immediate post-operative instructions are also included.

However, while the transcript covers the procedural and technical aspects comprehensively, it lacks a deeper explanation of the medical principles behind each step. For instance, there is no detailed discussion about why the sheath is sometimes excised or why this procedure alleviates symptoms. Also, the specific mechanics of how the nodule and sheath interact in trigger thumb are not elaborated upon.

Explanation:
The video transcript provided fails to describe the risks of the treatment discussed (A1 pulley release on the thumb). While the detailed surgical procedure is outlined, including aspects such as the incision, the use of a 15 blade, and post-operative instructions, there is no mention of any potential risks or complications associated with the procedure. 

Key elements such as the possibility of infection, damage to the nearby nerves or tendons, scarring, limited range of motion, or adverse reactions to anesthesia, which are critical for patients and viewers to understand the full scope of the surgery, are entirely absent. 

Without discussing these risks, the video does not provide a balanced view that would enable viewers to make informed decisions or prepare adequately for potential complications. As a medical expert, understanding both the procedure and its associated risks is crucial; hence, the video earns the lowest score of 1 in this context.","Score: 1

Instead, it focuses entirely on the surgical procedure for A1 pulley release on the thumb, detailing the steps involved, tools used, and postoperative care for the patient. There is a comprehensive explanation of the surgical method, from the incision to the closure, and even postoperative instructions, but nowhere does it address the potential consequences or natural progression of the condition if left untreated. 

Understanding the potential outcomes of not receiving treatment is critical for patients when making informed decisions regarding their healthcare. However, this transcript lacks any mention or discussion about what might happen if the surgical intervention were not performed, whether the nodule would cause increasing pain, limit thumb movement, or potentially resolve on its own. This absence of information about no-treatment scenarios means the video does not meet the criterion of explaining what would occur without medical intervention, resulting in the lowest score of 1.","Score: 1

The video transcript provided primarily gives a step-by-step description of the surgical procedure for A1 pulley release on the thumb. It details the incision, the identification and handling of the sheath and tendon, and the final steps for closure and post-operative care.

**Explanation:**

The transcript covers a specific surgical procedure, ""A1 pulling release on the thumb,"" and describes it in considerable detail. The focus is solely on the surgical approach, including the steps and considerations during the procedure. However, there is a passing mention of variability in the surgical technique: ""I don't always do that. It depends on the nature of the sheath and the construction."" This implies that there may be different methods or variations in handling the sheath during surgery.

While this statement suggests that the surgeon may adapt the surgical approach depending on individual cases, it does not clearly communicate that there are entirely different treatment options available for the condition itself. The video does mention alternative actions in handling specific parts of the surgical process, but it does not explicitly state or discuss non-surgical treatments or other surgical options that might be available.

Explanation: 

The video transcript provided does not support shared decision-making. Shared decision-making involves the collaboration between the patient and healthcare provider to make healthcare decisions that consider both the medical expertise of the provider and the preferences, values, and needs of the patient. 

In the transcript, the focus is almost entirely on the technical details and steps of performing an A1 pulley release surgery on the thumb. Although it may be informative for medical professionals, it does not appear to address patient involvement in the decision-making process. Critical aspects of shared decision-making, such as discussing potential treatment options, risks, benefits, and involving the patient in choosing the preferred course of action, are not mentioned. Additionally, there is no apparent dialogue or consideration of the patient's perspective, questions, or concerns.

JtqGbwJAAVU,"Trigger finger is a common painful hand condition that results in locking of a finger when the patient makes a fist. The following video demonstrates a surgical procedure called trigger finger release. The surgery is typically performed under an injection of local anesthetic. A rubber band is applied to the hand and wrist, and a tourniquet stops any bleeding so that the important structures can be easily visualized in surgery. A diagonal incision is made on the palm. The tissues are gently dissected. Retractors help to protect the important nerve and vessel branches. This is a transverse sling called a pulley. When it becomes inflamed, it constricts the flexor tendon. Incising the pulley with a scalpel and scissors releases the flexor tendon. The flexor tendon is pulled up from the incision and inspected. There is no more triggering or locking when the tendon is pulled. Passive flexion and extension of the finger is unimpeded. The patient also flexes and extends the finger, and there is completely normal movement of the affected finger. Previous triggering no longer exists and is not palpable. Triggering usually does not recur after the release. The incision is closed with two or three stitches. The hand is wrapped in a light bandage. There are almost no restrictions after the surgery, except for keeping the bandages clean and dry for two days. After removal of the bandage, the hand can be washed. The stitches are removed in 10 days. People usually return to office-type work the day after the surgery.",Trigger Finger,5,5,5,1,4,4,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,"Score: 5

I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon. I don't think it's going to be one of these two-day things, but even this just gets in my way. But I think that when this comes off that it won't be long and that will be pretty much my PT is typing, playing, and the million other things that I do. Although just to start with I'll be doing things like this. That's it. See you around. That's easy to turn this off. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",Trigger Finger,3,3,4,1,2,4,1,3,4,2,2,1,2,1,2,"Score: 3

Explanation:
The video transcript provided does a thorough job of detailing the personal experience of the speaker regarding the process and aftermath of trigger finger surgery. However, it falls short in comprehensively describing the benefits of the treatment. Here are the reasons for this evaluation:

1. **Description Lacks Focus on Benefits**: The primary focus of the transcript is on the surgical procedure itself and the immediate aftermath, including the preparation phase, the surgery, and the initial recovery period. It mentions some positive aspects, such as the ability to bend the finger without experiencing the catching sensation, but these mentions are brief and not elaborated upon.

2. **Limited Information on Long-Term Outcomes**: The transcript does not provide detailed information on the long-term benefits of the surgery. While the speaker expressed hopeful sentiments regarding the recovery process, there are no specifics on expected improvements in function or quality of life.

The video does not thoroughly describe the risks associated with the treatment of trigger finger through surgery, which justifies the score of 2. The narrator primarily focuses on detailing the surgical procedure itself, providing a thorough description of how the surgery was performed and his personal experience during and after the operation. While he mentions experiencing significant pain the morning after the surgery and hints that recovery might involve a few more complications than initially anticipated, this does not constitute a comprehensive discussion of the risks involved. 

For a more complete description, the video should have included specific risks such as potential infection, nerve damage, stiffness, and recurrence of the trigger finger, among others. By only touching upon postoperative pain and not elaborating on other possible complications or side effects, the video falls short of fully informing the viewer about the potential risks attached to the surgery.

I7svkSrtW5I,"Here you can see the anatomy of a normal, uninjured thumb. The synovial tendon sheath and the tendon are clearly shown. Inflammation of the tendon sheath is known as stenosing tinosinovitis. Stenosing tinosinovitis of the thumb, often referred to as trigger thumb, is one of the more common abnormalities of the hand. This condition is associated with painful triggering or locking of the thumb. When the patient tries to straighten the thumb, the nodule jams beneath the pulley proximally. This occurs with a painful snap, much like a trigger being pulled and released, with either flexion or extension of the thumb. Small changes in the tendon's diameter will have a significant effect on the function of the thumb. The nodule is usually pulled proximally to the pulley with active thumb flexion. That includes anti-inflammatory medication and injection. Inject into the sheath, not the tendon. Put the needle obliquely towards the tendon. Withdraw the needle slightly and inject freely into the sheath. Ultrasound guided injection of the tendon sheath and pulley may be of benefit. The needle is inserted into the sheath above the tendon and fluid is injected. If symptoms persist, consider surgery. Release the pulley to allow active motion without triggering. Note the position of the radial digital nerve close to the incision. Everything seems to be fine with this thumb, but there's definitely something tricky going on with this one.

So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like… It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see?

It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down?

The video primarily focuses on the description and demonstration of the ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) treatment for a patient with trigger fingers, providing insight into the patient's experiences before and after the treatment. However, the video does not clearly describe what would happen if no treatment is used. While there is some indirect indication of the patient's condition without treatment, such as the presence of pain, locking of fingers, and difficulty in performing daily tasks, there is no explicit mention of the expected progression or potential complications of the untreated condition. The video extensively highlights the benefits and improvements post-treatment, but it does not delve into the long-term consequences of leaving the condition untreated. Therefore, it only partially addresses what would happen without treatment, warranting a low score of 2. A higher score would require a more detailed discussion on the natural course of the condition if left completely untreated.","Score: 2

Explanation: The video primarily focuses on demonstrating the treatment process and immediate outcomes for a patient suffering from trigger finger using ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) therapy. While it provides a visual and subjective account of the patient's immediate relief and improved finger mobility, it falls short in discussing long-term effects on overall quality of life. 

The video briefly mentions improved function and reduced pain, which are certainly components of quality of life. However, it lacks a comprehensive treatment comparison, long-term follow-up, or an explicit exploration of how ASTR may impact various aspects of the patient’s daily life, emotional well-being, and overall health beyond the immediate relief. 

Key aspects such as potential limitations, side effects, or how the treatment might integrate with other medical interventions are not covered.

Explanation: The video transcript is primarily focused on the details of a specific treatment called ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) and appears to advocate for its effectiveness based on the inventor's personal experience and the treatment results of one patient. The extensive discussion centers around the improvements seen after applying ASTR, with no mention of alternate treatment options for the condition described. Since the narrative is tightly centered on the advantages and outcomes of ASTR, there is a significant lack of acknowledgment that multiple treatment choices may exist for the medical issue at hand (in this case, trigger finger). The transcript fails to provide a broader context which could include other approaches such as medication, other physical therapies, or even surgical options. Thus, with no evidence in the transcript to suggest any alternatives to the ASTR treatment, a score of 1 indicates that the video is not clear in communicating that there may be more than one possible treatment choice.","**Score: 2**

iKjPKT5sHkw,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",Trigger Finger,4,4,5,1,4,4,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,"Score: 4

RKE8LESi83o,"Trigger finger is a condition that often causes locking of any finger of the hand. Most commonly, trigger finger affects the ring finger and the thumb. It's also called synosyntinosynovitis, but it's obviously easier to call it trigger finger. What happens in this condition is the tendons that allow us to move our hands like this actually get stuck, so to speak, in the sheath, the covering of the tendon, or basically the tunnel that they have to travel through in order for us to be able to move our fingers freely. A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely. In theory, that sounds nice, but the reality is that steroid shots actually increase risk of tendon rupture, which is why people are limited to the number of steroid shots that they could get each year. And people with trigger finger a lot of times may undergo a steroid shot only to find that everything just really comes right back sometime later. Maybe they get a second steroid shot, the same thing happens, and then eventually they're recommended for surgery. What we do is oftentimes a combination of what we call a hydrodissection procedure along with prolotherapy. And what that involves is using a non-steroid injection actually into that tendon sheath to draw off swelling, kind of unstick any adhesions that might be there from chronic overuse, and allow that tendon to move more freely through that tunnel. Prolotherapy may also be warranted in these cases because a lot of times what we see is, let's say someone has trigger finger of their ring finger, it often goes hand in hand with injury, arthritis, or things to any of these joints along the path of that tendon. And so by doing a hydrodissection procedure to kind of free up that tendon in that tunnel, and then also doing prolotherapy to strengthen any joint or fix any injury in these fingers, those procedures work really well hand in hand to get trigger finger to resolve.",Trigger Finger,3,4,5,1,3,2,1,3,4,4,3,1,3,4,2,"**Score: 3**

Then, the transcript discusses an alternative treatment involving a hydrodissection procedure combined with prolotherapy, explaining their roles in reducing swelling and strengthening joints.

The nuanced presentation of multiple treatment methods—steroid injections, hydrodissection, and prolotherapy—demonstrates that patients have several options. However, the information is leaned towards the hydrodissection and prolotherapy combination as being more effective and sustainable, while still mentioning the drawbacks of steroid injections.

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about treatment options for trigger finger, including steroid shots, hydrodissection, and prolotherapy. However, it falls short in supporting shared decision-making for several reasons. 

First, the video primarily focuses on describing the condition and the treatments offered by the speaker, without emphasizing patient involvement in the decision-making process. Shared decision-making is a collaborative approach where healthcare providers and patients work together to make healthcare decisions, considering both the clinical evidence and the patient's personal values and preferences.

Second, the transcript does not discuss the potential risks and benefits of each treatment option in a balanced manner. While it mentions the risk of tendon rupture with steroid shots, it doesn't provide detailed comparative information about the effectiveness, risks, and benefits of hydrodissection and prolotherapy versus other options. Additionally, there is no mention of alternative treatments or non-invasive management strategies that might be important for a patient to consider.

Lastly, the transcript does not encourage patients to ask questions",set()
bF-F6pGVOyI,"Trigger finger is caused by a swollen tendon, your flexor tendon, that allows your finger to bend. Trigger finger is a form of tendonitis and it can happen from overuse or spontaneously out of the blue. Sometimes the issue will resolve spontaneously on its own. For the other cases we have several treatment options for trigger finger. Oral or topical anti-inflammatories are a good first option to treat conservatively. You can also try a nighttime splint for your finger to alleviate pain. The splint helps keep your finger straight at night while you sleep. Cortisone injections are also an option and are roughly 50% effective in treating trigger finger. Lastly, some cases of trigger finger require surgical release. Surgical release for a trigger finger is an outpatient procedure which means you can go home the same day. The surgery is performed for a small incision which typically takes about two weeks to heal. The total recovery period after surgery is three to four weeks during which time most patients experience some soreness or stiffness. After about a month you should be able to go back to your normal activities without the pain of your trigger finger.

Today we're gonna talk about the top three ways to treat trigger finger. Trigger finger, by the way, is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain. Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that.

This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching.",Trigger Finger,5,5,5,1,3,4,1,2,4,3,2,1,2,5,3,"**Score: 5**

pndnd5dgumY,"Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do.

At44YQYDFVI,"For today, I would like to talk about painful and clicking fingers. It's called trigger finger. Maybe some of you have experienced this problem. What causes trigger finger? Normally, when we flex our finger, there is a long tendon that pulls the finger and helps it smoothly slide through a protective sheath that surrounds it. In cases of trigger finger, the protective sheath can become inflamed with repeated use such as typing, texting, and other hand manipulations. When the sheath is inflamed, the tendon cannot slide smoothly, thereby causing the finger to click. It can affect any finger. It can affect the thumb. With repeated clicks, the tendon can also become inflamed, causing a nodule like a scar to form. I'll show you the picture. Okay, I'll show you the picture. So this is a picture of how our hand works. We have tendons that attach to our finger bones, and this is how we bend our fingers. In cases of trigger finger, as you can see, there is a nodule at the base of the finger, and this causes the painful clicking. What are the risk factors for having trigger finger? Persons around between 40 to 60 years old, they are more at risk. People are more commonly affected than males. Another risk factor is when you keep on using your hands. People who frequently grip and handle things like for work, hobbies are more prone to get trigger finger. Too much typing, texting, or working out with heavy dumbbells may also cause this. Those who play musical instruments for long hours are at risk. People with diabetes and arthritis are more at risk of getting trigger finger. So I'll be teaching you the treatment for trigger finger. For mild diseases, you can just rest your hand for a month. This can help improve symptoms, avoid repeated gripping, be aware that too much gripping can worsen a trigger finger, avoid using vibrating machines, try soaking your hand in warm water – this can help reduce the pain and the clicking, and you have to protect your affected finger and your affected hand. I will be showing you some simple exercises and stretches for trigger finger and also for other hand conditions. In trigger finger, there is usually a nodule at the base of the finger. If it's the thumb, it's located here, or if it's the finger, it's located here. Usually I had trigger finger several years ago, and there was this nodule at this part. It was really very painful when you bend it. One thing you can do is you can massage the nodule, as I've shown you. Try to massage it gently, clockwise, counterclockwise, for one to two minutes, maybe two times or three times a day, and try to stretch it slowly. Don't injure yourself afterwards. You can see if this works or not. If it doesn't work, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon or a hand surgeon. The doctor might do some steroid injection. Doctors may inject a steroid solution near the base of the affected finger. It's not that painful and not that expensive. This injection is more effective, this steroid injection, if you give it within one to two weeks from the onset of symptoms. So you have to consult your orthopedic surgeon early. And if this steroid injection doesn't work, there's also a surgical release of a trigger finger. Hopefully, we don't have to come into that. I will show you some simple exercises, not only for trigger finger, for carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is when you have numbness and pain and sometimes weakness of your hand. I'll show you some simple exercises. You can follow me. Try to open and close your hand 10 to 20 times. Try to stretch and loosen your fingers. After 20 times, try to open and close like this. Try to feel the stretch. I can feel the stretch. Our hands are very important, so we have to keep them in shape. Afterwards, you can try some maneuver. This maneuver is used for carpal tunnel. In carpal tunnel, you have to go into certain positions for 5 to 10 seconds. Just follow me. This is the claw position. Gently 5 to 10 seconds. Next is the half fist position. 5 to 10 seconds. This helps the tendon to glide and slide. Next you do the table top. You can do this for one hand or both hands. Then you do the close fist, completely close fist. 5 to 10 seconds. You can do this 2 to 3 times a day. 2 to 3 times a day. And there's one simple exercise. You just turn your hands around. Keep your hands higher than your heart. The swelling will be less. I'll just show you two last simple exercises. You can do this 5 to 10 times. Bend downwards 5 to 10 times to loosen your hands. Then bend upwards. You can do this 10 times, maybe at most 20 times if you want to rest your hands. Then try to turn it around. If your finger clicks, that's okay. We're trying to loosen and condition your hands. Okay, so those are my simple exercises for trigger finger for carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope this helps you. And if it doesn't work, I mean if you have trigger finger or carpal tunnel, if it worsens, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon. So thank you for watching my video. Thank you for subscribing.

The video clearly indicates that there are multiple possible treatments for trigger finger. Initially, the speaker suggests conservative management strategies such as rest, avoiding repetitive gripping motions, soaking the hand in warm water, and performing gentle massages and exercises to alleviate symptoms. These options are geared toward those with mild cases and aim to manage the condition conservatively at home.

The speaker also advises that if these measures do not provide relief, it is important to see an orthopedic or hand surgeon. They mention that a healthcare provider might consider a steroid injection, specifying that this intervention is most effective when administered within one to two weeks of symptom onset. This provides viewers with a non-surgical medical treatment option.

Furthermore, the speaker notes that if steroid injections are unsuccessful, surgical intervention is another alternative for more severe or persistent cases.

sjH6PE9-MTI,"The trigger finger is a condition that involves the tendons of the hand and the fingers. The tendons of the fingers pass through a series of pulleys, much like a fishing line passes through a series of guide wires on a fishing pole. These pulleys give us a mechanical advantage and give us a very strong grip. However, oftentimes the tendons can become inflamed and the pulleys can become thickened. This is what is referred to as a trigger finger. The symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the fingers that is often associated with a nodule or a small bump that can be felt and it can oftentimes be associated with catching or locking of the finger. In very severe cases, this does require manual assistance to obtain full extension of the fingers. Trigger finger is often caused by such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or diabetes, but oftentimes the cause is undetermined. If you suspect that you may be suffering from trigger finger, the first thing to do is begin taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve or ibuprofen. This will assist with the pain and will also decrease the inflammation around the tendon. You may also try gentle stretching at home, which would consist of locking the affected finger together and slowly stretching it out to try to stretch the tendon and prevent it from locking or triggering. If this does not work, it is advised to see your local hand surgeon, at which point you may receive a corticosteroid injection into the area of the pain at the base of the palm. A corticosteroid injection is extremely effective at decreasing the pain and oftentimes eliminating a trigger finger. If a corticosteroid injection does not work, a small surgery is recommended.

WZ3LlLCsNic,"Alan Litt is playing his guitar pain free for the first time in almost ten years. Thanks to hand surgeon Dr. Stephen Troum, a member of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. Just three months ago Dr. Troum treated Mr. Litt's trigger finger, a common but very diblitating ailment. Today the two are sharing their passion for music. The pain was excruciating. I was in pain all the time, my hand was locking, my finger was locking up all the time. I was depressed because I couldn't play and um, but the constant pain was the worst thing. It hurt all the time. So by the time I came in to see Dr. Troum I could hardly open my hand and I didn't want to. I basically kept it comfortable, in a comfortable fist like this, because that was not aggravating it at all. The pain was 24 hours a day. As soon as, it's the first thing you think of when i woke up, it was the last thing I thought of when I went to bed. So basically that's where I was before I had the surgery. Well when Mr. Litt came in, he came in with the classic complaints of trigger finger and that is his ring finger was catching on him and locking, and it was very painful. It was interfering with his work but it was also interfering with his activity as a guitar player and a musician. Initially we tried to treat it without surgery and we put him on anti-inflamatory medication, we also will try steroid injections into the sheath to try and make the swelling and inflamation go down, but that doesn't work, then the next step would be surgery. Trigger Finger is basically a tendon problem where you have inflamation in the tendons typically the flexors in your hand, is where it occurs. The inflamation causes swelling around the tendon and that swelling basically causes the tendon to snag inside the sheath giving you this locking or clicking or cathing sensation. Imagine basically like your belt, a series of belt loops and imagine tieing a knot in your belt and you might be able to pull it through the belt loop but it will pop or catch you and certainly if the knot is too big it won't even pull through. Now imagine cutting that belt loop that belt loop it's getting caught on. The belt will stay on your waist because you've got all the other belt loops holding it there but you've caught the one belt loop, cut the one belt loop that is causing the problem. The procedure starts out after we've prepped and draped the patient's hand, made a sterile field, he's asleep of course and we'll make a small incision about half an inch or so in the palm overlying that tendon sheath and in Mr. Litt's case it was of the ring finger. So it'll be an incision sort of in the palm and then we go down to the tendon sheath itself and the pulley, which is called the a1 pulley, it's the actual structure where the sheath begins, the beginning of the tunnel, as you might think. We insize that pulley and open it up and you can see the tendons underneath and you can actually move the finger and see the tendons gliding the way they should and once you've had an adequate release, opened up the sheath enough and the tendons stop clicking you're basically done at that point. You wash the wound out and close it up. The surgery was easier than getting your teeth cleaned. I mean I went in, they put me to sleep I woke up and bada-boom bada-bing and it was done. So after about three weeks, I had no clicking, my finger was not clicking any more, wasn't locking up, still hurt. It still hurt from the surgery a little bit but that was to be expected. I was warned about that, and I got to tell you it was something akin to a miracle. It was great. It was fantastic. I can move my hand again. I can move my finger again, loosely, easily. So if you're out there and you got trigger finger go see a hand surgeon. That's my experience. If you want to seek out a hand surgeon and you have a problem with your hand go to www.handcare.assh.org, it's the website of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. They have lots of patient education resources on the site as well as a directory where you can put in your city or your ZIP code and find a hand surgeon who is fellowship trained and board certified in your area. It's an irratation, It's a knot in your ligament and the only way to get help is really just to get that thing out of there and go see a hand doctor because it works.",Trigger Finger,4,4,4,2,4,2,5,1,5,3,3,3,4,4,3,"Score: 4

This video partially supports shared decision-making, meriting a score of 3. The transcript does highlight the importance of patient involvement, particularly in the initial stages of Mr. Litt’s treatment, which included non-surgical options such as anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections. This suggests that Dr. Troum and Mr. Litt likely engaged in discussions about the various treatment options and their potential outcomes before deciding on surgery. This aligns with the principles of shared decision-making, where multiple treatment avenues are considered and discussed with the patient.

However, the transcript lacks explicit evidence of a collaborative decision-making process. While Dr. Troum explains the medical rationale behind the surgery in detail, there is no direct mention of a dialogue between the doctor and Mr. Litt about the risks, benefits, and preferences related to the surgical option. Additionally, the patient seems to emphasize the efficacy of the surgery rather than discussing any active role he played in the decision-making process.

This process ensures that the patient's voice is heard and respected in their treatment plan. 

In this transcript, there are straightforward, step-by-step instructions with no discussion of alternative treatment options, risks, or benefits. No patient input is solicited or considered in the described treatment process. Additionally, the instructions are prescriptive and do not encourage the patient to engage in a dialogue about their care preferences or experiences.

Okay. - And it pops and clicks, but the the telltale sign is if it locks in place. - So when you close your hand that's when it's gonna go like a click. - It could, it could be when you close it could even, you could close it fine.

'Cause normally a brace like this you have to have fitted, believe it or not. And in fact, we had a lady who had a brace that was fitted for her and she lost it. - So the custom brace. - Yep. - Okay. - It was a custom brace. And so we gave her one of these and she ends up finding the other brace while she's wearing this one. And she still prefers this one. - Over the custom one. - Yeah.

And that's the one that stays still. So you don't- - That's exactly right. So one of the problems with braces quite often is if they brace the whole thing you can't move it at all, which is not good. - Right. - You wanna have some movement. So it kind of gives a solution here 'cause it gives you some movement but it doesn't give you the movement that's gonna cause it to lock up. - And that's the painful part. - Right. - Unfortunately this is not gonna make your pain go away, it may make your problem go away. - Right. - It's likely still gonna be there.

Explanation: 

The video transcript demonstrates a moderate level of engagement with areas of uncertainty, meriting a score of 3. Specifically, the discussion around the treatments for trigger finger acknowledges some uncertain outcomes. For instance, the conversation mentions that while the brace can provide symptomatic relief by limiting certain finger movements, it doesn't completely eliminate the pain or the underlying problem. Moreover, the physical therapists note that even with interventions like injections or surgery, there is no guaranteed permanent resolution, and the condition might recur. This indirect mention of potential ineffectiveness and the chronic nature of the condition introduces an element of uncertainty.

However, the transcript doesn't extensively delve into the nuances or the broader uncertainties associated with trigger finger treatment. There's no discussion on the variability in individual responses to different treatments or any mention of the limitations of current medical understanding regarding the condition.

Explanation: The video partially addresses the risks of treatments for trigger finger. While the physical therapists discuss a specific brace for treating the condition, they do not delve deeply into the potential risks associated with its use. They note that the brace allows some finger movement while preventing the problematic locking motion, which is a positive point. However, they do not mention any possible downsides to using the brace, such as discomfort, skin irritation, or the possibility that it may not alleviate symptoms for all users.

They briefly mention that other treatments, such as injections and surgery, are available but do not explore the risks and complications associated with these procedures. This is a significant oversight, as both injections and surgery carry potential risks and side effects that patients should be aware of.

Therefore, while the video does mention different treatment options and gives some insight into their benefits, it falls short of providing a comprehensive discussion of the risks involved, resulting in a score of 3.","**Score: 2**

58xQr9tOx24,"Hello, my name is Sanj Kakkar. I'm a consultant hand surgeon here at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and today we'll be talking about trigger finger. Trigger finger is a common diagnosis that we see in our hand clinic on a daily basis, where patients come in and they're experiencing pain in their hand, and sometimes the finger gets stuck. So, for example, when the finger is down, they often have pain and try to get it straightened. They often complain also of pain lower on in the finger, but the actual process that's going on is right over here, which is on the undersurface of the knuckle. And in terms of what's happening, if you look at this model here, the skin has been taken off for simplicity, but you can see these blue structures, and these are the tendons, and these are basically the rope that allow us to move our fingers back and forth. To keep the rope close to the bone, we have some natural thickenings, and these are called pulleys, and there are eight of these in the finger. However, in trigger finger, the actual process of where the problem is happening is on the undersurface of the finger, just underneath the knuckle joint. In terms of the cause of trigger finger, the majority of cases we don't know what the cause is. Sometimes it's related, for example, to inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, but the belief is that when one is gripping, there is a lot of force on the tendons overlying that pulley and underlining the knuckle, and that's what causes the inflammation. Patients complain of sometimes pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. They have difficulty in extending their fingers, and in terms of the actual diagnosis, it can be made readily in the office. Patients tend to be tender, just in this area where one's pushing, and you could actually feel it, the clicking, when they're making the fist. In terms of the treatment, a simple measure one can do is, for example, use a splint that keeps the fingers straight, especially at nighttime, and so that relieves the pain that patients have in the morning. We can also give a steroid injection, and this tends to work well, for example, in non-diabetics, in younger patients, where they've had symptoms for a short period of time, and also when the trigger finger, it tends to affect one finger, and sometimes it can affect a number of fingers. If the injection does not work or is not offered, other procedures that can be done is an office procedure, where one can place a needle just underneath the skin and release that catching pulley, or the other alternative is in the operating room. And this is done, it takes about five to ten minutes, and we need to be careful here, there are numerous nerves and blood vessels that need to be protected, and one simply removes the catching pulley system. Sutures are usually placed that come out after about two weeks' time, however, the patients are able to move their fingers straight away, and it's a relatively reproducible operation with good outcomes.",Trigger Finger,4,5,5,1,4,5,2,4,3,4,2,1,3,5,3,"**Score: 4**

kB-V9Sj2nok,"What's the cause of the trigger finger and how can you heal it? Hi and welcome to my channel. Today we're going to talk about the trigger finger. I know a lot of people who have that exact same problem and I also have some students who have the trigger finger. In order to solve a problem you always have to know what has caused it. Well sometimes the trigger finger is something that you were born with. In that case you can't do anything about the cause because you don't know anything about it. But very often people who have diabetes have trigger finger. People who are totally stressed out often have a trigger finger. Also if you work with a computer too often and use your hand all day long. Also when you have hands, neck and shoulders. That could be another cause. There are loads of different things you could look into. One of the best things to do is to journal. So start journaling and writing down whatever your finger snaps. Yeah, the trigger finger or the snapping finger. So when does it happen? What did you do before? Were you stressed out before? Did you work on a computer all day long? Or was your neck very tense? What exactly happened before? That would help you to find a cause and in most cases if you eliminate the cause then you solve the problem. So that would be a very helpful thing for you to do. Then I will show you which exercises you could do with your fingers in order to get rid of your problem. So let's get started right away. I know people who managed to eliminate that problem within the shortest period of time. Meaning a couple of weeks or a couple of months. And that helped them to avoid doing the surgery. So surgery is not necessary if you can avoid doing it. If you can use something that can help you. Even if it takes longer. Surgery takes 3 to 5 minutes. But you never know what's going to happen afterwards. And if you really take the responsibility into your hands and start working on it and improving your life situation. Then everything will click into place. So in case it's your index finger that's been causing the problem. Then stretch your arm. Take your index finger and start pulling it back. It should feel comfortable. It shouldn't cause any pain. But you should also be able to feel the stretching. Which goes here through the finger and perhaps even through the arm. So if you can feel that then you're doing it right. If it was your middle finger do the same thing with the middle finger. So whatever finger has been causing the problem. Focus on that finger and keep stretching it. And if you like the exercise do it with all fingers because stretching is always good. It's always good for you. And in case you would like to dive deeper into stretching then definitely look into doing yoga. That is something that's really beneficial especially for musicians. I can highly recommend it. So after doing this stretching exercise make sure that your arm is straight and your hand is bent backwards. As far as it goes. Then you just go back and move your fingers a little bit. Relax them. And remember to do this many times during the day. Like two or three times during the day. Every single day. And don't stop doing it even if you notice some improvement. Keep doing this exercise for a minimum of six weeks or even one year. Because the problem could come back. I know in some cases it comes back and people get so frustrated then they go straight to surgery. And I don't think that's necessary. You can definitely avoid that. So keep doing your exercises. Keep stretching. And then you will see how you can solve a problem within the shortest period of time. And even if it takes one year it's totally worth it. Because you'll notice that you're capable of changing things and creating the life situation of your dreams. Am I right? After doing your exercises or before you can also massage your hand. You can massage your whole hand and fingers and everything. But if you don't have enough time then definitely massage here. Where the finger starts at the beginning of the finger. We want to give it a nice massage. And do that every day. Either before you do the exercises or after. It doesn't matter. Whatever feels comfortable to you. There are loads of other methods that could improve the flexibility of your fingers. One of them is acupuncture. The other one is lifestyle changes. Make sure you drink enough water. You exercise regularly. You get enough sunshine. And you eat loads and loads of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis. All of that plays into your health. And if part of your body doesn't work the way you want it to work then definitely ask yourself some important questions. Am I taking care of myself as well as I can? And you can always improve that. Now I am going to show you on my violin what you could do in order to help your fingers become very flexible and relaxed while you are playing. So first of all when you are playing on an E and A string your left arm is looking to the floor. The tip of your elbow is facing the floor. But when you are playing on the D string and on the G string your arm comes out so that you can see your elbow. And that is very important because it allows your fingers to stay on a string without having to stretch. Which would put extra stress on them. Which you don't want to have because you don't need any extra stress. Especially if you have a trigger finger. So make sure to move your arm just like a pendulum. Always moving around depending on which string you are playing. So when we are on the A string it is here facing the floor. When you are on the D string it comes out. And when you play on the G string it comes out even more. And in order to find out whether you took your arm out far enough you can check it here by plugging the string with your pinky. If your pinky can plug the string on which you are playing without having to stretch or to get stressed out about it then you are on the right path. Then you are doing the right thing. So remember this very important tip. Take your arm out when you are playing on the D and on the G string. I hope you found this video helpful. In case you didn't give us thumbs up, subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next video. Leave me your questions or comments down below. I will see you again in the next video.

Y4Se6z-qNmU,"Trigger finger is a condition in which a finger locks up or gets stuck in a flexed position. It can be difficult and painful to straighten out the finger. When it does straighten out, it snaps open or triggers. In order to understand why this occurs, it is important to understand a little bit about the anatomy of the finger. Two tendons travel up the bones of the fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus attaches to the bone at the tip of the finger, known as the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum superficialis, which sits just on top, attaches to the middle phalanx. As muscles in the forearm contract, they pull on these tendons, which in turn pull on the bones of the finger. This bends, or flexes, the finger. Without anything holding the tendons up against the bones, they would bowstring as the muscles contracted, and so there are small ligamentous structures, known as pulleys, that hold the flexor tendons in place as they travel down the bones of the fingers. Some of the pulleys have fibers that cross over one another. They are called cruciate pulleys. Some of the pulleys simply pass straight over the tendons. They are called annular pulleys. The pulleys are numbered according to their position. Triggering usually occurs at the A1 pulley, or the first annular pulley. If something irritates the flexor tendons, they may swell. This causes rubbing and friction against the pulley each time the finger bends and extends. The irritation worsens and the tendons thicken. Over time, the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. Once the finger has been flexed, the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck. With effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open.",Trigger Finger,3,4,4,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Score: 3

However, it lacks crucial context about when the information was produced or any references to the date or source of the information used. There's no mention of the latest research, medical guidelines, or how recent the exercise recommendations are. In a medical or health-related video, understanding whether the information is up-to-date is important given the fast-evolving nature of medical knowledge. The lack of citation or reference to the timeline significantly diminishes the ability to gauge the currency and relevance of the information. Therefore, the video only minimally meets the criterion for being clear about when the information was produced.","Score: 2

Explanation:
The video transcript appears to be not very balanced or unbiased, scoring a 2 on the 1-to-5 scale. Firstly, the transcript focuses solely on demonstrating a specific exercise for the pudendal nerve without providing any contextual information. There is no background on what the pudendal nerve is, why flossing exercises may be necessary, or who might benefit from this specific exercise. Therefore, it lacks a comprehensive view that would aid in understanding the significance and potential benefits or drawbacks of the exercise.

Secondly, the transcript does not address any potential risks or contraindications associated with the exercise, which would be crucial for viewers who might have different health conditions or fitness levels. This lack of a balanced perspective could potentially lead to inappropriate use or misunderstanding of the exercise instructions.

Finally, the language used is purely instructional and does not cite any sources or evidence supporting the efficacy of the exercise. An unbiased video might include references to medical studies or professional guidelines to substantiate the recommendations made","Score: 1

w8hXvyWGupo,"If you're someone dealing with pudendal neuralgia, there are certain things that may be happening in your day-to-day routine that could actually be exacerbating your symptoms and you may not know it because it may not hurt at the time, it may show up a few hours later or even a day or two later. In today's video, we're going to discuss these activities and things that you can do at home to provide a happy environment for your nerves so you can continue to get better. One of the biggest contributing factors to pudendal neuralgia symptoms are static postures. What we define as static posture is if somebody is staying in the same position for longer than 15 minutes. We know that a lot of people with pudendal neuralgia get exacerbated symptoms with sitting. However, you can also be compromising yourself unintentionally when you stand in the same exact position for just a little bit too long. Ways to get around this would be to stand on something such as a piece of gardening foam that's going to provide a slightly unstable surface so you're shifting and moving moment to moment, avoiding standing in the same position, for example, at your standing desk for a little bit too long. You can also vary your sitting positions between a chair, between a certain type of cushion, between a physiotherapy ball. All of these variations will use different muscles which will allow other muscles to take a break as soon as you change into the next position. Keep in mind the general rule of thumb is roughly 15 minutes. If you're stuck in your car for 20 to 30 minutes, you can also shift from side to side. You can rotate the position of your pelvis forward and backwards just to provide some variance to which would otherwise be a static and possibly problematic posture. When people wear even the slightest heel, this actually dramatically changes the position of our pelvis. It tips our pelvis into an anterior position which lengthens the pudendal nerve and increases your pelvic floor tone. Both the lengthening of the pudendal nerve and the increase in pelvic floor tone can exacerbate the symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend wearing supportive sneakers all the time. Bare feet can also compromise the position of the pelvis in a similar way that heels can and therefore supportive sneakers are really the best choice. In our bodies, everything is connected. Therefore our ankle, knee and hip positions can also affect the pelvic floor and symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. People with pudendal neuralgia notice that they have trouble walking up hills. This happens for two different reasons. Number one, there's increasing amounts of hip flexion as you advance a leg up a hill which can tension the pudendal nerve. If your nerve can't slide, glide and move properly, this extra tension can provoke a symptom. Also when we are walking uphill, we have an increase in our pelvic floor muscle tone which can compress the nerve and cause a little bit of symptom in that manner as well. A tip to get around this because sometimes we can't avoid the hills are to actually turn around and walk backwards. This is going to shorten the pudendal nerve as well as activate the posterior muscles which actually allow your pelvic floor muscles to relax. Many people with pudendal neuralgia have noticed that core exercises increase their symptoms. It's helpful to understand why. When we do activities that raise our intra-abdominal pressure or activate our core, our pelvic floor muscles reflexively contract to support our bodies. If somebody has a pudendal nerve that's irritated, this contraction of the pelvic floor is going to further compress the nerve and cause a little bit of irritation that may show up in a delayed response. Therefore, we recommend working with your physical therapist to discover what time and place is actually appropriate for you to reintroduce these types of activities and that typically is after the nerve is less reactive to touch. Easily, this is identified in a physical therapy session. Lifting heavy objects will result in pelvic floor contractions to help stabilize our bodies which in turn can also exacerbate symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend finding ways to avoid lifting heavy objects. However, if you can't, we suggest doing diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic floor drops after lifting the heavy object assuming that that did make your pelvic floor muscles tighter for the moment. Doing diaphragmatic breathing or pelvic floor drops can help the muscles return to normal tone if you can't avoid lifting the heavy object. Pudendal neuralgia is a mechanical condition in which the nerve needs to be able to slide, glide, and move. In cases of symptoms, the nerve can't do that for some reason and it can happen at multiple points along its course through the pelvis. One of the key muscles that compresses the pudendal nerve is called the obturator internus. This is an external rotator of the hip. It tends to get tight and if that muscle is tight, it's going to impair our ability to either bend forward or raise our knees up to our hips. People will often notice that this does immediately cause maybe a shooting, stabbing pain in the territory of the nerve. Once we lengthen that muscle and get it to stop compressing the nerve, people can bend forward, they can bend over, and they can bring their knees up to their chest without a problem. But in order to do that, we need to restore the normal mechanics. If you notice that you're having trouble bending over or squatting down, there's a few little tips and strategies that you can do to make it a little more comfortable. When you have both feet planted on the ground, it's going to be more provocative for your pelvis and for the pudendal nerve. We suggest trying to slightly separate your legs or bend over using just one leg at a time. You can use assistive devices such as a grabber or your physical therapist can show you techniques specific to you to help avoid provoking your nerve. One thing people with pudendal neuralgia may not think about is their fluid intake. A symptom of pudendal neuralgia can include urinary urgency and frequency, which results in our desire to go to the bathroom when our bladders are not actually full. This is problematic for many reasons, but one of which is because it starts to retrain our body to send signals that we need to urinate at less than normal volumes. By adequately drinking 64 ounces of water a day, we will have a full bladder when we go to use the bathroom. This will help keep our normal reflexes in check as well as elicit a proper pelvic floor relaxation that cannot occur at lower bladder volumes. Speaking of our bowel and bladder habits, a squatty potty is a very effective tool for people with pudendal neuralgia. The squatty potty helps improve our pelvic floor alignment that allows any type of voiding behavior to be a little bit easier and we do recommend that for patients with pudendal neuralgia as well. Something that isn't talked about enough is how much emotional stress and rising cortisol levels actually can affect the pudendal nerve. It is the only nerve in the body that has sympathetic, sensory, and motor fibers, which means that this nerve is going to be more sensitive to emotional stress, but also provides an opportunity to help calm the irritation by strategies such as diaphragmatic breathing and meditation. We understand that most people cannot meditate at the times they may be feeling emotional stress, but actually taking a pause and doing five to six deep diaphragmatic breaths is known to help lower cortisol levels and thereby help restore a calmer environment for your nerve to function normally. Here at PHRC, pudendal neuralgia is one of our top specialties. If you feel like you are struggling with these symptoms and would like some individualized attention, please give us a call.

fCqJ8XfcfVM,"Hi, my name is Dr. Ross Hauser. Welcome to Caring Medical Florida in Fort Myers, Florida. A common condition that we see is pelvic floor dysfunction, which causes, which can cause pudendal neuralgia or compression of the pudendal nerve. The most common treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction is actually different types of physical therapy. And often that is helpful, but very seldom do I find that it cures people. If somebody has really severe pudendal nerve pain, sometimes they actually even have surgical decompression. So the surgeon is trying to release the nerve surgically in the various parts of its path that can cause compression. What most people don't realize is that the pudendal nerve, the reason that the pudendal nerve gets stretched, gets compressed, gets irritated is because of pelvic instability. So I just want to explain how pelvic instability causes pudendal neuralgia and also pelvic floor dysfunction. So this is basically the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor is in between the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joints here. It's right here, the perineum. If you see here, this is actually the sciatic nerve. This is actually the sciatic nerve. So we all know the sciatic nerve goes in the back of the leg down to the foot, but most people don't realize these nerves, as you look in here, this is from the L5, S1, S2, S3 nerves. These nerves come out the sacrum. So the sacral nerves, the S1, the S2, the S3, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So I just want to show that. Okay, so you see like this is the sacrum. So this is the sacrum. See how the sacral nerves, the sacral nerves here, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So the most common reason the sacral nerves would get irritated is because the sacrum is moving too much. So some of these nerves come out the back, but then some of the nerves, some of the nerves, they're going to come out the front and then they're going to go into the perineum. One of those nerves is the pudendal nerve. You know, the nerves are coming out the front here. So some of these, the lower sacral nerves, the lower sacral nerves, they're going to form the pudendal nerve. That's what you see here. See how there it's going out of the sacrum and then it forms the pudendal nerve. So the question is what would cause the sacrum to rotate the sublux, to have too much movement where it actually is going to irritate these sacral nerves. Well the most common reason is going to be either sacroiliac ligament laxity or pubic symphysis laxity. Now sacroiliac laxity, in other words, the sacrum and the iliac crust, they move too much. So say a person had right pudendal neuralgia and what that would cause is unbelievable pain in the perineum and it often can be on one side. So terrible pain in the perineum. Well the pudendal nerve, the pudendal nerve, it goes between the sacrotuberous ligament and the sacrospinal ligament. Right here the pudendal nerve, to get into the pelvic inlet here, it goes between these two ligaments. So if somebody has laxity on one side, ligament laxity on one side, that would mean that there's going to be extra bony movement of this anomone bone on that side and the pudendal nerve can get entrapped between the sacrotuberous and the sacrospinous ligament. So the treatment then would be proper alignment of the anomone bone and also stabilization of the pelvic instability with prolotherapy.",Pudendal Nerve,3,4,4,1,2,2,1,2,3,2,1,1,2,3,2,"I would rate the aims of the video as **3 (partially)**. 

Here's why:
The video appears to have two main aims: first, to explain the relationship between pelvic instability and pudendal neuralgia/pelvic floor dysfunction, and second, to suggest treatment options, including physical therapy and prolotherapy. While Dr. Ross Hauser does eventually get to explaining these points, the presentation is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear, upfront statement of the video's objectives. 

The explanation is detailed yet circuitous, beginning with a mention of common conditions seen at the clinic, then moving through a description of the anatomy of the nerve and the pelvis, and finally discussing treatment options. This approach can make it challenging for viewers to grasp the primary aims immediately. Further, although the video provides a good amount of detailed information, including anatomical explanations and potential causes for nerve irritation, the linkage between these pieces of information and the overall aim to educate and potentially guide toward specific treatments is not as clear","Score: 4

Dr. Ross Hauser effectively explains the anatomical and biomechanical basis of pelvic floor dysfunction and its relationship to pudendal neuralgia. The detailed description of the pelvic floor anatomy, the overview of the sacral nerve pathways, and the explanation of how pelvic instability leads to nerve irritation are very well-articulated. This educates the audience on a complex medical condition in a comprehensible manner. The visual aids used to demonstrate the anatomical structures also help in reinforcing the verbal explanations.

However, the video falls slightly short of perfection in a few areas. Firstly, it would benefit from a clearer structure; the explanations sometimes feel a bit repetitive and disorganized, which might confuse viewers who are not already familiar with the topic.

Explanation: 

The video in question is highly relevant to individuals seeking information on pelvic floor dysfunction, pudendal neuralgia, and their underlying causes such as pelvic instability. Dr. Ross Hauser, from Caring Medical Florida, provides a detailed explanation of how pelvic instability can lead to conditions like pudendal neuralgia by affecting the sacral nerves due to ligament laxity. He also discusses potential treatments such as physical therapy and surgical decompression, although he notes that these treatments are often not curative.

The video is particularly useful for patients experiencing severe pudendal nerve pain and those exploring potential causes and treatment options for their condition. Dr. Hauser's use of anatomical references and explanations offers valuable insights into the mechanics of the pelvis, sacrum, and associated nerves.

Explanation: 

The transcript of the video presented does not clearly mention any sources of information used to compile the material discussed, apart from the author's own explanation and experience. Dr. Ross Hauser provides a detailed description of pelvic floor dysfunction and its connection to pudendal neuralgia, including anatomical explanations and treatment options. However, at no point does he acknowledge external sources, studies, research papers, or medical guidelines that support his statements. 

For a medical expert's discussion to be highly credible, it is essential to reference external sources such as clinical studies, peer-reviewed articles, or authoritative guidelines that underline the medical advice or insights being provided. This helps in reaffirming the validity of the information being shared and demonstrates that the content is built on a foundation of established knowledge and evidence rather than solely personal expertise or anecdotal evidence. Therefore, given the lack of any cited sources, the video transcript scores a 1 on the clarity of sources of information used.","Score: 2

Explanation:
The transcript provides a detailed explanation of pelvic floor dysfunction, pudendal neuralgia, and their relation to pelvic instability, but it lacks clear temporal context and specific references to when the information presented was produced or the sources from which it was derived. While Dr. Ross Hauser offers a thorough anatomical and physiological description, the absence of dates, studies, or references to current research, guidelines, or prevailing medical consensus affects its clarity regarding the time frame of the information's origin.

Medical information can evolve, and without understanding when the data or observations being discussed were produced or validated, it becomes challenging for viewers to assess the relevance and currency of the content. This is particularly crucial in fields like medicine, where treatments and understandings of conditions can change rapidly.

Explanation: The video, as per the transcript, appears to be somewhat imbalanced and biased for several reasons. The primary focus is on the perspective and approach of Dr. Ross Hauser, particularly emphasizing his view that pelvic instability is the main cause of pudendal neuralgia and pelvic floor dysfunction. While the information provided about the anatomy and potential treatments is detailed, the transcript does not present a balanced view of all possible causes and treatments.

Firstly, Dr. Hauser mentions physical therapy and surgery but quickly dismisses their efficacy without providing comprehensive data or references to support these claims. This suggests a possible bias towards his preferred method of treatment, prolotherapy, which might not be universally accepted or validated by broader medical research.

Secondly, the transcript lacks input from other experts, which could have provided alternative viewpoints or corroborated the presented information.

The video transcript marginally refers to areas of uncertainty, but it does not explore them in depth. Dr. Ross Hauser discusses pelvic floor dysfunction, pudendal neuralgia, and their common treatments, such as physical therapy and surgical decompression. He suggests that these treatments often do not cure the condition, which can be seen as an implicit recognition of uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of standard treatments.

However, the transcript does not delve into other uncertainties or ongoing research in the field. There is no discussion about why physical therapies often fail, nor is there mention of any evolving or experimental treatments that might offer more promise. The focus is instead on Dr. Hauser’s specific approach involving prolotherapy and stabilization, which he presents as a solution without addressing any uncertainties or limitations of this alternative treatment method.

The video transcript presents a detailed explanation of pelvic floor dysfunction, pudendal neuralgia, and the anatomical and mechanical reasons leading to these conditions, essentially focusing on a lecture-driven approach. Dr. Ross Hauser methodically describes anatomical structures, the potential causes of nerve irritation, and common treatments like physical therapy and surgical decompression. However, the concept of shared decision-making (SDM) in the context of clinical treatment options is not well addressed.

Shared decision-making requires a balanced presentation of treatment choices, their risks and benefits, and includes patient preferences and values in the decision process. While Dr. Hauser does touch upon various treatment options, the discussion remains largely authoritative and technical, lacking the empathetic communication necessary to engage patients as active participants in their treatment plans. There is no evident effort to discuss risks versus benefits of different treatments, alternative care strategies, or consider patient preferences, which are essential components of SDM.

J4ObY48wdhU,"Hi there, I'm Dr. Britta Allgeier. I'm going to talk to you about the Pelvic Wand. This is a pelvic wand by Intimate Rose. I'm going to just give you a brief overview on how to use it. It is a little intimidating when you first see it, but it is a great, great, I can't say enough wonderful things about this. Once you get comfortable using it, you'll really love it. There obviously are two ends. Typically this is the end that we use rectally, and this is the end that we use vaginally. You can use whichever one you wish. I usually recommend starting with this end just because it's smaller. It's similar to the size of your finger. This one is great once you get comfortable using it because you can get to deeper muscles in your pelvic floor. It's got this nice curve so that you can angle it around. Whereas if you're trying to do that with your finger, it gets very hard to reach into those deeper muscles. For vaginally, we will start more with a superficial. This looks like a triangle. A lot of times you will work on these muscles when you're having pain with insertion, pain with intercourse, bladder pain. Believe it or not, there's a little muscle right underneath the labia that can spasm and it can feel just like a bladder infection. If you want to help alleviate that without taking medicine, if you do have a bladder infection, obviously you need to get that treated. When you go to the doctor and they tell you, you don't have a bladder infection, you're like, well, why does it feel like it? Well, because this muscle right here is spasming. Also, there's an area right here. We typically refer to it as a pelvic clock. This is 12, this is 6. This area is a great area to focus on as well when you're pregnant just because you want to lengthen the vaginal opening so that you don't have tearing right here. You can use this wand or your finger. You start by putting lubrication on it. We use slippery stuff, but you can use whichever you want. We recommend not using anything glycerin based or with any kind of added sugar ingredients because that can lead to infection, which we don't want. You put a little lubrication on here and then you'll just slowly go in. I like to start more at the bottom and work my way up, but you can start whichever way that is comfortable for you. You'll just go in and just gently pull. It's just like a pulling, lifting sensation. It shouldn't hurt. If you feel like a stingy burning sensation, just back off from the pressure. You just move along and it should just feel like a pulling sensation, a little bit of a stretching. You go around and then go to the other side. 10-15 seconds in each spot and deep breathing while you go on. Just inhale and exhale. Go through three breath cycles and then move your way around. This is more the superficial layer. To get to the deeper layer, these guys right in the bowl of your pelvis, you go in vaginally and then you'll go right over to these. If you have pain with deep penetration or near the hip muscles, going in deeper will help target those muscles. If you go in at 6 o'clock, you're going to hit more of these organs. This is your bladder. That's more at 12 o'clock. This is the vaginal opening. That's what you're going through. This is your rectum. If you feel a little pressure down here, you're hitting your rectum. You're not going to hurt anything, but it may feel like you have to go to the bathroom. If you come up at the 12 o'clock area, you'll hit your bladder. Again, it will just feel like you have to pee. Just go over to the side. The last part is using the Intimate Rose Wand rectally. The best position is on your side. You'll put the lubrication on. This is your tailbone. You're going to be angling right off to the side, both angles. This little muscle right here, this is your coccygeus. It's a little troublemaker. If you just gently go into that, you'll feel pressure. It's typically tight. Just hang out there. You just go in slowly. You're pulling and lifting. Again, if you have discomfort or it's painful, just back off on the pressure. Deep breathe. You just move around every 10-15 seconds. If there's a target area that feels really tight, just hang out there and do some deep breathing. Then you'll go to the other side as well. I hope that helps. I recommend starting with a pelvic floor therapist just to figure out what it's going to feel like. We can go over how to use this in our office and guide you through it. Also, make sure that you're using it correctly. I hope that helps and takes away the anxiety of using this.

2. The video discusses a ""radio frequency ablation"" procedure performed by pain management doctors. It states that the procedure worked for nine months by alleviating pain but also caused scar tissue. While this mentions the practical outcome, it lacks a thorough explanation of the process of radiofrequency ablation—that is, how it uses heat generated from radio waves to destroy tissue.

The video transcript primarily focuses on the patient's journey, starting from the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, the various treatments he underwent, and ultimately the successful intervention by Dr. Elkwood. While the narrative provides in-depth details about the procedures, their complications, and the eventual resolution, it does not describe what would happen if no treatment had been used.

The patient's experience highlights the pain and complications from treatments such as seed implants and radio frequency ablation but fails to address the natural progression of prostate cancer without any medical intervention. Instead, it concentrates on the iatrogenic effects (problems caused by medical intervention) and their resolution, rather than the consequences of untreated prostate cancer.

The transcript discusses a journey through various treatments for prostate cancer and resulting complications, but does so in a somewhat fragmented manner, without explicitly emphasizing the availability of multiple treatment options at any given decision point. Initially, it describes the use of ""seeds"" to treat prostate cancer, which unfortunately led to severe complications. Subsequently, it mentions that pain management through a procedure called radiofrequency ablation was attempted, which provided temporary relief but caused additional scar tissue.

Later, the narrative shifts to encountering Dr. Elkwood, who carried out a different medical intervention focused on microsurgically releasing nerves damaged by previous treatments. While the narrator hints at ""very good treatment options for Pudendal Neuralgia,"" providing a suggestion of additional choices in treating complications, this isn't thoroughly elaborated upon.

ykWPPGNuHZk,"If you are having pain in your clitoris, penis, scrotum, labia, perineum, or anus- especially when sitting, your doctors have ruled out infections, & they're not sure what's wrong with you you might have Pudendal Neuralgia. In this video we are going to talk about what Pudendal Neuralgia is, how people get it, and why physical therapy is such an important part of someone's treatment plan to help recover from this syndrome. If you suspect you have Pudendal Neuralgia, one of the questions you need to ask is- Is it on one side of my body or both? We have a pudendal nerve on the right, we have a pudendal nerve on the left. And commonly when it starts to get activated & turns into a neuralgia, it's going to affect one side more than the other. It's important to differentiate neuralgia symptoms from muscle aches and pains. And so typically, neuralgias (whether it's pudendal or elsewhere) have sharp, shooting, stabbing pain versus ""I feel a little achy, I feel a little sore."" That's different. We're really looking along the path of the nerve to see that it's neuropathic in nature. And by neuropathic, we mean: burning, throbbing, aching, stabbing. The Pudendal Nerve is unique because it is one of the only peripheral nerves in the body that has sensory fibers, motor fibers, and autonomic. Which means automatic fibers too, in addition to the pain that accompanies Pudendal Nerve the pudendal nerve is involved in a number of reflexes that are tied to orgasm, bowel movements, and urinary function. So people may also experience urinary urgency, frequency, burning with urination ,painful ejaculation, inability to orgasm, or difficulty with bowel movements & pain associated with bowel movements. There's a wide range of reasons why people develop Pudendal Nerve, and for some people it can be one of the things I'm about to mention or a combination of a few. So if we're looking at some of the general categories, we can start with compression. This means the people who are cyclists, who ride horses, or who sit for long periods of time during the day. Going in the opposite direction, there can also be tension injuries. So this is more commonly associated with things like: long second stages of labor, or chronic constipation, or certain types of exercise that involve deep & excessive ranges of motion with the hip & lumbar spine. The next category can be associated with surgical trauma. So for various pelvic floor conditions, whether it's prostatectomy or pelvic floor reconstruction for different types of prolapse, there can be a surgical insult somewhere along the path of the pudendal nerve. And finally there can be traumatic issues that affect the pudendal nerves; such as car accidents or falling on top of various items in your lawn or in the yard that can basically cause an injury in or around the congenital nerve space. Because there's so many different reasons why somebody has pudendal neuralgia, it's really important to get down to their anatomy and physiology to figure out what is causing their symptoms. So regardless of the mechanism of how it developed, the next phase is to figure out- is there muscle dysfunction, is there tissue dysfunction, what is happening along the course of someone's pudendal nerve that does not allow the nerve to move, glide, and slide the way it should, therefore resulting in symptoms. So unfortunately the people you think to go to when you have symptoms of pudendal neuralgia (a gynecologist, a urologist, potentially a neurologist) are really not the people equipped to evaluate why someone has pudendal neuralgia. Which really leads into the expertise of a pelvic floor physical therapist and physical therapists who can identify various muscles tissues and reasons why the nerve is compromised. So physical therapy is so important for pudendal neuralgia because what will happen during evaluation with a physical therapist compared to a swab or a culture or something that happens on the medical side, is the physical therapist is going to do a history to help identify potential mechanisms as to why their nerve got irritated. But then also do a very specific physical exam that is going to look at movement patterns, muscle tone in the pelvic floor, and the pelvic girdle muscles, trigger points, tissue issues, and reasons that are going to compromise the nerve anywhere along its course. Which runs basically from the sacrum through the pelvic floor to all the different areas we mentioned initially (the clitoris, the penis, the scrotum, the labia, the perineum and the anus). There are various places along the course of the nerve that can get compromised. Certain people may have compromise along the entire track of the nerve. Certain people may only have compromise in one little spot. The physical exam and the movement exam that physical therapists can do will help identify each individual person's causes for why they're having the symptoms that they're having.",Pudendal Nerve,4,4,5,1,4,3,1,4,3,3,1,1,3,2,2,"Score: 4

AZbkolcvYVQ,"What is pudendal neuralgia? That's the subject of this video. Stay tuned. Hey, this is Dr. Shakti from Core Pelvic Floor Therapy right here in Irvine, Orange County. Pudendal neuralgia is a commonly, I mean if you know about the term, chances are you probably have that. The reason I'm doing this video is because I wish people would catch it before it becomes a full blown issue. What is happening here with pudendal neuralgia is you have the nerves coming from the lower part of your sacrum area. And then it goes through into the inside and it goes through these different landmarks within your pelvis, the ilium part of your pelvis. And then it goes, it branches off. So you've got the pudendal nerve which is an offshoot of the sacral nerve and then it branches into three sections. One goes to the penis and vulva, the other one goes into your anal area and the third one goes to the space in between. So you can have entrapment, you can have irritation and inflammation of this nerve from the site of origin which is the lower part of your spine and sacrum all the way to those three areas that I mentioned. The issue with pudendal neuralgia is by the time they diagnose it, there's been too much time that has been spent. That's been pretty much wasted. And then there are these blocks, it has to respond positively when the nerve is blocked and then they can say, okay this is pudendal neuralgia. Go see a pelvic floor therapist for it. It's hard to reach certain parts depending on where the irritation is. And many times you're basically, it's like okay you've got to live with it. So when is a good time to catch it? Is if you have chronic lower back pelvic pain. When I say pelvic pain, I'm not talking about pain in your penis or vagina. I'm talking about pain in the pelvic area, in the pelvis, in the SI joint. If you have chronic hip issues, those are great reasons why the pelvis itself loses its balance and stability. So all structures, not just any soft tissue like a nerve, but all structures become compromised. So if it happens to be your pudendal nerve or a branch of the nerves exiting your spine or your sacral area, then that will be the issue. Pudendal neuralgia should not be a life sentence. But it's very easy to get distracted in the course of the treatment and a lot of time goes by. And by the time the final conclusion is made, it may be a little too late. So you kind of have that lingering pain or pain for the rest of your life. So it's very important to catch yourself. Don't disregard pain in your sacroiliac joint, in the lumbar area, lower back area, in your hips. Don't disregard them. Don't look at them like, oh, that's not related to this thing. People should look into these things more carefully. And the most important part is to make sure you see the right person for treatment. A lot of times when you go to see a medical doctor, they write off those areas like lower back, SI, and hip problems as an orthopedic problem. So go get some physical therapy or go see a chiropractor. Well, that's not enough because if the examination is not very much specific to rule out pudendal nerve subtle symptoms, then it's very easy to miss it and then it becomes a huge problem. I hope this video is making you realize how important it is to see the right type of provider and do not disregard subtle symptoms as if they have no value. Sorry about that. If you have any questions, make sure you use one of the methods of contact in the description box. Contact my office. Let's talk and see what's going on. Hope this helps.

6axdhKqkoIg,"Pudendal neuralgia. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that both men and ladies can get. It's caused by an irritation or an over-activation of the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the nerves that comes off the nerve roots at the base of the spine. It's formed from the branches of L2, 3 and 4 and comes off part of the sciatic nerve. The pudendal nerve is quite unusual because it carries both sensory and motor fibres. That means it tells the muscles that it innovates what to do and also it carries sensations, so pain, touch, temperature and so on. It's got some autonomic function as well. Autonomic means the automatic processes that our bodies are involved with. That can be things like bowel function, it can be involved a little bit with bladder control, it can also be involved with sexual function such as orgasms or erections. People who struggle with pudendal neuralgia usually have pain associated with an irritation of the areas that the pudendal nerve supplies the sensation to. That's generally your pelvic floor which is what I would consider the underhand saddle area of your bottom and your genitalia. You can also have some shooting pains occasionally and going down your legs. If this nerve becomes irritated or over-activated you can experience quite severe neuropathic pain, sharp shooting, burning pain. Because you have two pudendal nerves, one on the left and one on the right, often the pain can be more predominantly on one side than the other. But it's not uncommon to have pain on both sides, particularly if the process that's resulting in that occurs in both. Nobody knows exactly why people get pudendal neuralgia but sometimes it can be caused by stretching of the pudendal nerve, particularly in cyclists who adopt a position where the pudendal nerve can be stretched. It can also be caused by sitting down for very long periods of time and we all know that as a society in general now we tend to sit a lot more than we ever did before. It can be caused by trauma, particularly during things like childbirth or labour if there's a long second stage. Or it can be caused by just a very, very tight pelvic floor. So that's the muscles that supply and hold the internal organs down through the bottom of your genitalia and things like that. There's also some suggestions that irritation or activation of your pudendal nerve can be caused by hormones such as going through menopause or even indeed endometriosis. So pudendal neuralgia is really quite a debilitating condition because you can have sharp shooting burning pain at any time, can be unprovoked and is made worse by sitting down. Quite often the pain is relieved by standing up or lying down and sleeping and things. But it's not always relieved by that and quite often sleep at night can be really quite disturbed with it, which is often the case with a lot of chronic pain conditions. Because the pudendal nerve supplies the muscles of the pelvic floor, so that's the muscles underneath that hold your internal organs up and in, if the pudendal nerve gets irritated or activated that causes these muscles to get really, really tight. And we all know that when you get tight muscles, if you get tight in your shoulders, the tighter they become, the more the pain evolves, the worse the pain becomes. And these muscles then squeeze really tight and because the pudendal nerve comes out as three branches and it forms an almost finger-like projection through these muscles, the tighter these muscles squeeze together, if the nerve is going through it, these nerve branches of the pudendal nerve then get squeezed and tightened even further. And so you can quite easily fall into this vicious, vicious circle where you've got pain, the muscles get tighter because of the pain that's there and that squeezes the nerves even more, which causes more pain and more tightening of the muscles. So it's one of these conditions, if we want to try and treat it, we need to try and break it down and we need to look at medication and predominantly anti-lerve pain medication, so the anti-lerve painkillers. We need to look at those to try and relieve the irritability and the wound up nature of the nerve pain. We also want to look at some physiotherapy, particularly looking at the pelvic floor, trying to relax the muscles of the pelvic floor and then potentially looking at any other therapies that can reduce the over-activation of the nervous system, whether that's psychological therapies or just simple relaxation exercises. And often the condition can be brought back to a much, much more manageable state. Very occasionally we can do injections, particularly if it's really, really severe, to try and just relax the muscles and to reduce the irritability of the nerve.",Pudendal Nerve,4,4,5,1,2,4,1,5,3,3,1,2,3,5,3,"Score: 4

The video does well in informing viewers about the condition and potential interventions, including medication, physiotherapy, other therapies, and injections. This level of detail can certainly help patients understand their options.

However, the video does not encourage active participation from the patient in the decision-making process. There is no mention of discussing these options with a healthcare provider, considering personal preferences, or involving the patient in understanding the risks and benefits of each option in the context of their own life and values.

So what happens is that patients who have this condition will have a lot of pain in their rectum, perineum, vagina or clitoris or menopenis and scrotum. It's a very severe neuropathic type of pain so it affects our quality of life. It causes a lot of suffering. Most patients get this from some sort of accident or trauma so either a fall, a surgery or something that can have a direct impact or injury to the pelvis. So there are some patients who cannot sit or they cannot stand because of it and those are usually the most severe presentation of this. And the next steps would be is finding out if there's something that is kind of reversible or maybe what the cause was of the pudendal neuralgia and sometimes we treat the cause and things may get better. If everything has looked so far looked fine, there's no underlying cause, this may be someone where surgical decompression of the pudendal nerve may help them.

oCxK0at4NFc,"If you're suffering from pain in the pelvic or genital area, and have seen numerous specialists but despite that no cause can be found, then this video on Pudendal Neuralgia might provide you with some useful information. The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them.

CpOzLBcxntA,"Hi there, it's Kathy Cates and Melissa Hines from the Institute for Pelvic Health. And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

Explanation:

The transcript provided lacks clarity regarding the sources of information used to compile the content of the video. The speaker shares a personal narrative about experiencing pain, seeking medical help, and undergoing a surgical procedure. Although the story is detailed and specific to the individual's experience, there are no external sources, medical studies, published papers, or expert opinions cited to support the content. The mention of ""reading all of the reviews and stuff"" is vague and does not provide credible, verifiable sources.

For the transcript to score higher, it would need to include specific references to medical literature, expert consultations, or documented studies that inform the content. Specific names of studies, authors, or journals, as well as any medical guidelines referenced, would have made the sources of information clear. The current transcript appears to rely solely on the personal testimony of the speaker, which, while valuable, does not indicate external information sources used to compile the video.","Score: 2

o3JY6D6qbtU,"I'm Dr. Andrew Elkwood. I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

uFWk7ztMfj8,"This video will explain what to expect when you are getting your nerve block. Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days.",Pudendal Nerve,5,5,5,1,2,4,1,2,4,2,3,1,2,3,4,"**Score: 5**

HCjtaJFgv6E,"Pudendal neuralgia and pudendal nerve block. Pudendal neuralgia is an important cause of chronic pelvic pain in both men and women and results from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve. Pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves in the pelvis and originates from the sacral nerve roots. In the gluteal region, it runs between ligaments and close to the sciatic nerve before entering the Alcox canal. Pudendal nerve entrapment results from compression of the nerve during its course through the ligaments or the Alcox canal. Symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment include pain in buttocks and genital areas, pain in the back passage and lower abdominal pain. Pain is typically aggravated by sitting and relieved by standing upright. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, rehabilitative approach including pelvic floor exercises and injections. Dr Krishna is highly experienced in performing pudendal nerve blocks. The injection is performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. Dr Krishna will initially numb the skin with a numbing medicine. He will then use an ultrasound machine to guide the needle accurately close to the pudendal nerve. Dr Krishna will eventually inject a mixture of local anaesthetic and steroid around the pudendal nerve. Pain relief from pudendal nerve injection can last several months, though this may not always be the case.

IpY79hQKlEk,"Good morning everybody, I am George Mjes from the St. Joseph University in Beirut, Lebanon. Today I am going to be presenting about laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release or pudendal entrapment syndrome. I have no conflict of interest. Pudendal nerves can be entrapped at different anatomical sites along with the pudendal artery. The two main entrapment locations remain between the sacrospinus and the sacrotuberous ligaments and the alcocanal. Pudendal nerve and artery entrapment is an underdiagnosed condition in clinical practice that causes mainly perineal pain and sexual dysfunction, but also urinary and rectal symptoms. Historically, and after failure of the conservative management, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes and this is why the non-criteria which were put to standardize the diagnosis were very selective in order to minimize overtreatment by such an invasive approach. This was until the advent of laparoscopic pudendal release which allowed a minimally invasive surgery with an easy access and gentle blood-free dissection. This has therefore led to widening of surgical indications. The aim of our study was to assess the safety, feasibility and functional outcomes of laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome with both a short and long-term follow-up. 235 patients with pudendal nerve entrapment were included in the study and they underwent laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release. Post-operative complications, according to the Clavian-Dendou classification, were recorded both on a short and long-term follow-up. Those are briefly the surgery steps. First, we developed the octorator space and we carried the dissection medially to the octorator vein. The coccygeous muscle fibers must be cut and released to have access to the ischial spine on which the surgeon's forceps pointing in Figure C. Finally, we arrived to the entry to the alcocanal. Here, we can clearly see the pudendal vein and artery entering the alcocanal. The pudendal nerve is lateral to the artery and not visible in the image. The goal of the surgery is to liberate the pudendal elements from the ischiatic spine to the alcocanal and transpose them medially. After assessing the post-operative outcomes in the total cohort, a prospective cohort of 32 patients was evaluated for functional outcomes before and at least 24 months after surgery. The main outcomes that were assessed are pernioidemia using visual analog scale, urinary symptoms using the urinary symptom profile, erectile function using the IIEF5, and bowel function using the patient assessment of constipation symptoms PAC-SYM score. The mean operative time per side was 33 minutes and the hospital length of stay was 2 days for the majority of patients. No significant blood loss and no serious clavian-dindo 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. Prenile or perineal paresthesia or hyperaesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint. However, it was transitory for 3 months after which all patients were free of symptoms. As for functional outcomes, perineal pain decreased significantly from a mean of VAS of 7 to a mean of 2. Erectile function improved significantly after surgery and we think it is most probably due to the artery entrapment since immediate results were seen after surgery. Constipation also decreased significantly after surgery. As for the urinary symptoms, improvement was only noted for the dysuria domain. No significant differences were found between before and after surgery or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms. So to conclude, laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release is both a fast and safe surgery with promising functional outcomes on pudendal neuralgia, erectile function, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation.

It is heavy on technical details, procedural steps, and statistical outcomes of the surgery. Shared decision-making in the medical context involves an interactive process where healthcare providers share information about treatment options, risks, and benefits, and patients share their values and preferences to make a mutual, informed decision.

This transcript lacks explicit elements that support shared decision-making. There is no reference to the role of patient preferences, values, or the decision-making process from the patient’s perspective. The information is delivered in a one-sided manner, focusing on clinical outcomes and procedural efficacy. While this information is valuable, it is presented in a way that is more informative for clinicians rather than engaging patients in the decision-making process.

The material could have been more supportive of shared decision-making by including discussions about alternative treatment options, potential risks and",set()

Unfortunately not too many people either in the medical community or public at large really have a full grasp of pudendal neuralgia, it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed undertreated. In edition it's a huge psychological stress for patients and sometimes in and of itself if it causes psychological issues. For the cause of pudendal neuralgia there are many from anything that is what we called idiopathic meaning you don't know why it happens. It can be certainly from childbirth, exercise trend towards riding- bike riding is terrific but racing bicycle seats can really be a problem if some of those see if they're not fitted properly, put all of the weight on the pudendal nerve and that's a terrible thing. Chronic constipation can be a problem any reason for straining whether be lifting or otherwise anything that would cause the veins in your forehead or in your neck to pop up cause can cause the veins in the pelvis to pop up and if those in large veins put pressure on a nerve, you can end up with pudendal neuralgia. Those are the typical causes. Post-radiation for cancer treatment can also be a cause. I would say post patients though are idiopathic in that we don't know what causes it but it's very much akin to a carpal tunnel in your wrist for carpal tunnel is compression of the median nerve which is the nerve that goes to the 3 and 1/2 thumb sided fingers and that nerve goes through a tight tunnel and if the nerves swell for whatever reasons than nerve gets pinched and you get into nerve problems. Alcott's canal in the pelvis is analogous to that it's a tight tunnel where the nerves in the column go through so the pathophysiology or how the disease develops is something that's well understood and the surgery is really aimed at that particular anatomy in the right patient population the surgery can be incredibly effective.",Pudendal Nerve,3,3,5,1,3,3,1,4,2,1,1,1,2,1,2,"Score: 3

48kkAh_J6nE,"It's a condition you don't hear about, but it's one that makes it impossible for some people to sit without severe pain. Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers. From Houston's News Leader, this is 13 Eyewitness News, Live at 5. I'm Kristi Myers. Imagine not being able to sit because of the pain. How one young woman who was suicidal had her life turned around. That story coming up later on Live at 5. She suffered from unspeakable pain that prevented her from even sitting down. It would take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations. This is a saving place. 13's Kristi Myers with how she got the pain to stop. Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life. And this was Gina only three days after surgery. I really don't feel any of the deep aching or the burning sensations that I would have deep in my buttock area. And that's just really exciting.

Gynecological issues involving the uterus and cervix as well as urological issues involving the prostate can all present similarly to Pedendal Neuralgia. There are also musculoskeletal problems involving the hips and hernias which can also mimic Pedendal Neuralgia. The human body has difficulty differentiating pain especially within the pelvis which is why we order imaging to help make our diagnosis. A typical workup includes an MRI of the lumbar spine throughout any spinal abnormalities as well as an MR neurography to help visualize the Pedendal nerve, the pelvis, and the hips. We also order a CT guided Pedendal nerve injection to help provide the patients with pain relief as well as to help make our diagnosis. All patients require pre-operative testing. Each patient needs to have lab work completed. It is up to the surgeon's discretion whether the patient requires a medical clearance. For example, if a patient has cardiac medical problems then they'll need a cardiac clearance prior to surgery. The nurses will provide the patients with scripts for lab work and EKGs as well as clearance forms. The patients will then be able to take those scripts and clearance forms to their primary care provider or any other physician they need to take them to to have it completed.

The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released. Once the nerve is released we just have to check the mustaches and we conclude our procedure by routinely instilling a mixture of corticoid and local anesthetic. We don't put any drainage and of course we close the peritoneal defect. The follow-up of the office was at one, three and six months and the visual anologic scale was two, nine preoperative.

Explanation:
The transcript of the video provides a detailed account of the pudendal nerve, its anatomical course, potential causes of injury, symptoms, and various treatment options. However, it falls short in supporting shared decision-making (SDM) for several reasons.

Shared decision-making is a collaborative process that involves clinicians and patients working together to make informed healthcare decisions that best align with the patient's values, preferences, and circumstances. A video that supports SDM should ideally encourage patient involvement, discuss risks and benefits of each treatment option, and guide how patients might communicate with their healthcare providers to make tailored decisions.

While this transcript does offer a variety of treatment solutions (rest, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, etc.), it does not delve into the risks and benefits associated with each, nor does it encourage detailed discussions between patients and their healthcare providers.

v_svimhWU9c,"Hey, we're back with another episode of ""10 patients in 10 minutes."" And this one episode one: pelvic floor pain, and could also be a case of pudendal pain. And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone.

The aims of the video are somewhat clear but lack a cohesive and well-structured presentation, which prevents it from achieving a higher score.

The video appears to aim at discussing cases of pelvic floor pain, with a specific focus on distinguishing pudendal nerve pain. The presenter elaborates on three individual cases, highlighting specific adjustments and corrections made to alleviate the pain. However, there is a significant amount of detailed medical terminology and explanations without a clear, overarching objective stated at the beginning.

While each case is discussed in detail, there is an inconsistency in how the information is presented, which can be confusing for viewers. The transitions between cases are not smooth, and the detailed anatomical descriptions might not be easily understandable for a general audience.

Explanation: 

The video largely fails to provide clear, easily discernible information about the date or time frame when the presented data and cases were produced. The speaker discusses different cases of pelvic floor pain and pudendal nerve pain but does not specify when these patient cases were observed or treated. There is a lack of context regarding the recency or timeframe of the information, which is vital for understanding its relevance and potential applicability to current scenarios. This omission makes it difficult to assess the validity and contemporaneity of the medical information presented. 

Additionally, while the speaker discusses techniques and outcomes in considerable detail, the absence of dates, study references, or time markers hampers the viewer's ability to gauge how current the methodologies and outcomes are. This lack of temporal context limits the ability to fully trust the applicability of the advice.

Therefore, the video receives a score of 2, indicating that the information about when the data was produced is not clear enough for viewers to ascertain its relevance","**Score: 2**

The video exhibits a notable imbalance and bias primarily due to its narrow perspective. Here is an analysis that justifies the chosen score:

1. **Single Practitioner's Viewpoint**: The entire video is presented from the perspective of Dr. Zachary Ward, a chiropractor. It lacks input from other healthcare professionals who might offer different diagnostic or treatment approaches. Pelvic floor pain can involve various specialties such as urologists, gynecologists, or physiotherapists, but their viewpoints are absent.

2. **Emphasis on Chiropractic Solutions**: The video heavily focuses on chiropractic adjustments as the primary treatment for pelvic floor and pudendal nerve pain. While these methods appear effective according to the presented cases, the video does not discuss other potential treatments such as physical therapy, medications, or surgical interventions in detail. This creates a biased impression that chiropractic care is the superior or only solution.

Firstly, the video concludes with explicit information on how to contact Dr. Zachary Ward for further questions, providing an office phone number (248-598-4002), a website (LIAChiro.com), and a Facebook page (/LIAChiropractic). This means viewers have multiple avenues to seek further individualized advice or support.

However, while these contact options are useful, the information is somewhat limited to the resources provided by Dr. Ward himself or his practice. The transcript does not mention other external organizations, support groups, or extensive educational resources on pelvic floor pain or pudendal neuralgia.

While it outlines the correction techniques and the physical outcomes (e.g., reduction in pelvic pain, postural changes), it does not extensively discuss how these treatments impact the overall quality of life of the patients.

The closest it gets to addressing the quality of life is by mentioning symptom reduction (e.g., 50% reduction in pain, complete resolution of pudendal nerve pain in one case) and noting some functional improvements such as reduction in bladder issues or ability to stand taller. However, there is no in-depth discussion on how these improvements translate into broader quality of life metrics such as mobility, psychological well-being, daily activity levels, or social functioning.

Explanation:
The video transcript does partially refer to areas of uncertainty, so I rated it a 3. It highlights a few uncertain aspects without deep exploration. For instance, the initial diagnosis and understanding of the patient’s chronic pain sources involve some uncertainty until the medical professional can provide temporary pain relief and make a more definitive diagnosis regarding the pudendal nerve. There is mention of providing temporary relief as a diagnostic tool, which implies that the full resolution and treatment plan are yet to be determined and could involve further uncertainty.

However, the transcript does not delve deeply into the nuances of these uncertainties or discuss the potential challenges or incomplete knowledge involved in diagnosing and treating the condition comprehensively. Most of the focus is on the patient's past suffering, the relief she's starting to experience, and the hopeful future ahead thanks to the doctor's interventions.

The video transcript partially addresses the treatment in question. It identifies the pudendal nerve as the source of the patient's pain and mentions that a procedure involving this nerve was performed, offering temporary relief. However, the transcript lacks comprehensive details on how exactly the treatments work.

While it touches upon the fact that the pudendal nerve is operated on and vaguely refers to relief techniques, it doesn't provide specific mechanisms or detailed procedures involved in the treatment. For instance, it doesn't explain the type of surgery or intervention used on the nerve, how it alleviates pain, or why it was chosen over other potential treatments. 

The discussion is more focused on the patient's experiences, emotions, and improvements post-treatment rather than the technical workings of the medical intervention.

FjF4euhFWY8,"Welcome. I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day.

Many patients that I've treated in the past have found limited benefit or relief from surgery or from traditional therapy such as injections of steroids. Pudendal neuralgia is caused by many different things, but commonly we see chronic inflammation and impairment in the nerve function. Stem cell therapy is unique in that it not only provides the ability for the body to restore or to block the inflammatory response, but it can actually permanently restore normal blood vessels, providing oxygen to that nerve, which is essential for the repair process. Even in situations where the nerve becomes entrapped by tissue, it's typically an inflammatory response, and the stem cells are incredible at breaking down that inflammatory tissue and helping to restore normal function. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that affects at least 1% of the population, women more so than men, but it's not something that we need to suffer from.

Rachel fellers can now enjoy the ancient practice of yoga because a centuries-old treatment is allowing her to do it pain-free. I feel amazing. Rachel is at Loyola University Medical Center for an advanced type of acupuncture. After years of chronic pain in her abdomen, this is now allowing her to live a more normal life. It all started when she was 12 with terrible dehydration and vomiting. I also passed out in the middle church and had to be carried out. She tried everything, even traditional acupuncture, but nothing worked. But this acupuncture study involves placing the needles in a more concentrated way and includes heating the needles to target the most painful areas. If I put the needles in and the heat penetrates all the way into your booboo, how good would that feel? Rachel was blown away by the results.
