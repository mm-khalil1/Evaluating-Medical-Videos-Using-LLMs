OWtlKJbg_Pc,"Nocturnal Enuresis. And this is essentially defined as involuntary voiding of urine greater than twice a month at night. The cause of Nocturnal Enuresis can involve quite a few risk factors. And some of those include uncompleted toilet training, greater nighttime urine volume, difficulties in arousal from sleep. In addition, family history is actually also associated with Nocturnal Enuresis. It runs in families. One very important aspect to the etiology of Nocturnal Enuresis is sometimes there can be organic causes, medical conditions. And the two most common are diabetes and a urinary tract infection. So those two things should be explored during the diagnostic workup. And one final thing I wanted to mention is sometimes problems with anatomy can contribute. So for example, if there's a problem with the ureter or if there's a problem with the bladder sphincter, then that can also contribute. In terms of a diagnostic workup, the very first thing you need to do is obtain a good history from the patient and the parent, of course, because you're talking about children. So ask, is there any pain during urination that can help explore a urinary tract infection? Ask if there's polyuria during the day, urinating a lot during the day, that can help explore diabetes. Another thing that's very important to explore is social history. Is the child under any kind of stress? Are there problems that he or she is undergoing at school or at home? And usually there isn't too much of a diagnostic workup in terms of labs, but some basic tests that you can definitely do are a urine analysis that will help, you know, rule out a UTI. And a basic blood glucose level can help quickly explore the possibility of diabetes. In terms of treatment, the good news is that usually Nocturnal Enuresis is self-limiting. So the patient and the parent should be counseled about that. But if this is a problem that has not gone away and is becoming very troublesome, then treatment options definitely exist. And those treatment options, most effective one is interestingly a bed wetting alarm. And this alarm basically has a mechanism where it triggers whenever the bed becomes wet. And it has a 70% success rate. Now, if this has been tried and still not successful, then definitely medications can be used. And if meds are needed, there's two that are used. The first one is called Desmopressin. Now Desmopressin essentially is ADH, antidiuretic hormone. It brings water back. Instead of urinating the water out, the water is brought back into the bloodstream. That's essentially what the mechanism of action of antidiuretic hormone is. The next medication that's used is Imipramine. And Imipramine is used definitely to treat Nocturnal Enuresis, but you have to be careful because it has some serious side effects. And one of those side effects is that it can cause cardiac arrhythmias. So now let's take a look at a few vignettes. A five-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of recurrence of bed wetting at night. He has a three-month-old sister who is healthy. Physical exam is normal. A urine analysis shows specific gravity of 1.01, glucose is negative, protein negative. Microscopic shows 0 to 1 WBCs per high-powered field and 0 RBCs per high-powered field. Which of the following is the most important information to share with his parents? Well, of these answer choices, let's take a look. This condition will see that they reprimand him for deliberately wetting the bed. Probably not a good thing to say to a five-year-old boy. This condition is self-limiting and they should take care to lessen the emotional impact on their child. That's a good option, we'll keep that. This is a potentially serious problem and could represent chronic inflammation of the kidneys. Not necessarily true. This may be a precursor of diabetes. That's not true. And this signifies a serious underlying emotional disorder. Not necessarily a serious. What's probably happened, we don't really know. But perhaps the birth of a sister recently has caused a little bit of stress and he's wetting the bed. So the best choice is B. Next question. An eight-year-old boy is brought to CU because of his parents being concerned about his lifelong history of bedwetting at night. This behavior occurs an average of five or six times per week. However, he does not have any daytime wetting or incontinence. His parents have tried several tactics to stop his behavior, including fluid restriction, night awakening, and rewards for dry nights. But the behavior has continued. The boy has had no medical problems and is doing well in school and with his friends. His physical exam is normal. Which of the following diagnostic and therapeutic strategies is most reasonable? Well, let's go through these. No further studies in the trial of imipramine. Imipramine can be used, but there's one thing that you should try before you go to meds. IV pyelogram, nah, not really needed. Reassurance that he will grow out of this behavior. This is a good choice, but the problem is that he's going on for so long, something needs to be done. Lifelong history is obviously very serious, so I'm not going to choose C. UA and the use of moisture sensitive alarm at night. Yes, this is the best effective treatment for Nocturnal Enuresis. And U.N. trial of imipramine, again, imipramine can be used if choice D is not successful. And then finally, a two year old boy is brought to the emergency department because of increasing and profound lethargy during the past four hours. The past medical history is unremarkable. However, a seven year old brother who is a bedwitter has an upper respiratory infection. There have been no other contacts with individuals who are sick. On physical exam, the child's temperature is 99 and he is noted to be hypotensive. There is no history or evidence of trauma. Cardiac monitor demonstrates a ventricular dysrhythmia and the child begins to have a seizure. Which of the following is most likely cause for this child's problem? Okay, well, a little complicated there, but what's probably happened is you have a seven year old brother who has a bedwitter. That seven year old is on imipramine. And what's probably happened is this two year old boy has ingested that imipramine. And that has resulted in one of the more common side effects of imipramine, which is a cardiac arrhythmia. So the cause for this child, the two year old, having this dysrhythmia and of course even later the seizure is imipramine.",4,3,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

95T3ABnnhOs,"Even after toilet training, it's not uncommon for a child to occasionally wet his or her bed at night. But for parents like Ted and Lisa Dittmeyer, it can be frustrating. At age three, their daughter Michaela was a frequent bed wetter. When she was wetting her bed every night, it was very aggravating. I had to change the sheets every day. I had to wash the sheets every morning, put them back on the bed every day. It was very time consuming and it got very old. And worrisome. Is she all done? Yeah. In the beginning, Ted and Lisa were very concerned about their daughter's condition, but they informed her pediatrician and were relieved to learn that it's very common for children Michaela's age to wet the bed. Bedwetting is so common that in young children we don't even consider it a disorder of any kind. So for example, 10% of five-year-olds wet the bed on a regular basis. I wouldn't consider that an abnormality and in fact I don't make any interventions in younger children who are wetting the bed. It's nice to hear that Michaela isn't the only one with the problem. It was nice to be reassured by their pediatrician that there's other children with the same problem. What causes a child to wet his or her bed? There may be a number of factors, including a small bladder capacity, genetic factors, a urinary tract infection, and even emotional stress. But the primary and most common cause of bedwetting is difficulty waking. A child's body is not yet trained to recognize the signs of a full bladder, so the child simply won't wake up when it's time to go to the bathroom. Some studies show that children wet the bed during all different stages of sleep. But children who sleep very deeply, particularly children for example who've just given up their nap so they're sleeping very deeply, are not aware on any level of the contractions of the bladder. What can be done? Ted and Lisa find that waking Michaela up to use the bathroom three hours after she goes to sleep helps reduce the number of wet nights. Good job. I try to do my part and help out with Michaela's problem by waking her up in the middle of the night if my wife is too tired and taking her to the bathroom. It's kind of a bonding experience there and it's nice that we can have that time together. For some children, avoiding liquids late at night and using the restroom before bedtime can help. But that's usually not enough to solve the problem altogether. Until bedwetting stops, there are a few easy steps parents can take to help their children feel more comfortable. They can protect beds with fitted plastic mattress covers used with overlay pads for absorption, provide children with protective undergarments, read books on bedwetting to them, have clean pajamas ready and waiting for them, and encourage them to help change the sheets and remake the bed. This can help give a child a sense of control and make him or her feel like a big boy or girl. Lisa says that family support is also imperative. The other children in the house do not tease her at all. We have made it a point to instruct them not to tease her about the bedwetting and they've been very supportive about that. The whole family has been very supportive with Michaela's problem. As a matter of fact, my oldest daughter, Deanna, helps Michaela out a lot in the morning. She'll take her to the bathroom, make sure she goes to the bathroom again, undress her, take off her wet clothes, and clean her up and get her ready for the day. Family support is very important with a bedwetting problem. It helps me, it relieves my stress, and it enables Michaela not to feel inadequate in a sense. Often, the only real complication of bedwetting is the embarrassment the child feels for having done it. To help minimize these feelings, explain to her that bedwetting is not her fault and that lots of kids her age do it, and never punish her for having made a mistake. I think the most important thing to remember about bedwetting is that this is something children will outgrow so that it won't harm them in the long term unless it's made into a big issue in the family that makes them feel ashamed or belittled or makes them feel as though there's something wrong with them. So it's important to help children feel like they're okay, this is just part of the normal development. Little bodies need time to mature to the point where they can actually get up and go when they need to. It's starting to happen for Michaela. One time at night, she walked into my room and she said, Mommy, I just went to the potty. And she realized she had to go to the bathroom, and she got up herself and went to the bathroom.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Exploration: The video aims to inform and reassure parents of children who wet the bed about the commonality of the issue, the possible causes, and some strategies to deal with it. The video also emphasizes the importance of family support and understanding. The aims are mostly clear, but there are some minor digressions and repetitions that could be improved.

### Final answer: 4"," 4

Explanation: The video does a good job of explaining the causes and prevalence of bedwetting in children, as well as offering some practical tips for parents to help their children cope with the issue. However, it could have been more informative about the potential medical interventions for bedwetting, such as medication or behavioral therapy, and how they might be appropriate for some children.

n8kmsN0em90,"Enuresis is intermittent nighttime incontinence in a child who is aged 5 or older. There are two types of enuresis: Primary and Secondary. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis is by far the most common type. It is urination at night, during sleep, in a child aged 5 or older who has not yet attained bladder control. It is often due to a delay in maturation of bladder control or due to a developmental disorder. This type is more common in boys and it usually resolves on its own. Because most cases resolve spontaneously, the treatment for primary nocturnal enuresis should not be considered until the child is 7 years of age. Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis is involuntary passage of urine in children who have previously achieved bladder control. This secondary loss of bladder control can be due to an underlying organic disease process (such as a urinary tract infection or diabetes) or it can be because of psychological stressors (such as birth of a sibling, school problems, and family discord). Diurnal Incontinence (loss of bladder control during waking hours) is often associated with enuresis and nearly 80% of these children lose control at night. Treatment of enuresis depends on the type and etiology. For most cases, reassurance is enough, as some children will outgrow the problem. Sometimes, behavioural modifications, enuresis alarms, or medications can be used. If incontinence is secondary to another pathology, treating the underlying cause will resolve symptoms.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,3,4,5,4," 4

XFitRQ9S68Q,"There are two very common drugs that are used, one is called desmopressin and the other is called oxybutynin. Desmopressin acts like the anti diuretic hormone I've mentioned in the past. The whole idea of this drug is to try and reduce the amount of urine that the kidneys are producing overnight and it can be taken either as a tablet or slipped under the tongue as a little melt just before going to bed. It’s started at a low dose and if there’s no benefit after a few weeks then the dose can be increased to see if that helps. In general desmopressin is a very safe drug to take, it doesn't cause very many side effects. But like all medications there's a very small number of young people who may complain of some nausea, vomiting or loss of concentration amongst other things whenever they're taking the desmopressin. If you're worried about any new signs or symptoms that develop after your young person starts taking it you should just have a chat to your family doctor about it. If the young person who's taking desmopressin starts to have any vomiting or diarrhoea it's important that you don't give the desmopressin during this period of time because that can cause problems with the fluid in the body and problems with the salts in the body. Oxybutynin is another very common medication that's used to try and help young people with bedwetting and oxybutynin acts like a relaxant for the bladder, it chills the bladder out. It's mainly used to try and treat the overactive bladder that we see a lot in young people and if that's present at night that can cause the bladder to squeeze down and make the young person wet the bed and again it can be started at a low dose and the dose increased if there's no benefit to it. Again it can cause problems such as nausea, vomiting, loss of concentration, change of mood. And again if you're worried about any new symptoms that develop after your young person starts to take oxybutynin then it's worthwhile having a chat to your family doctor about this. Bedwetting is such a common problem in young people that NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) have developed a guideline which should be used nationally, so it doesn't matter if you go to see your family doctor in London or somebody in the north of the country, they should be able to follow these guidelines. NICE suggest that you can try either the desmopressin or the oxybutynin as the first line treatment. If the drug that you're given doesn't work you should then try the other drug, so if you've tried desmopressin and that hasn't worked then you should try oxybutynin and vice versa and if you find that desmopressin and oxybutinin on their own have both failed, then the next step is a trial of both drugs together. If desmopressin and oxybutynin together don't work then there is another drug called imipramine that can be used to try and help bedwetting. But by the time that you're getting onto using imipramine it doesn't have a high success rate, but it does work in some young people and if you warrant trying imipramine, your doctor will discuss this with you.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, as it explains the use of two common drugs for bedwetting and their possible side effects.

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, it mentions that desmopressin and oxybutynin are the first-line treatments recommended by NICE, but it does not guarantee their effectiveness for every individual. It also suggests trying the other drug if the first one does not work, and then trying both drugs together, which implies that there might be some uncertainty about which drug or combination will work best for a particular person. Additionally, the video mentions that if desmopressin and oxybutynin together do not work, there is another drug called imipramine that can be used, but it does not have a high success rate. This indicates that there is some uncertainty about the effectiveness of this drug as well. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty, and the score is 4."," 4

McNoYWn4RVs,"We'll talk about beginning some form of treatment, whether it's medication or bedwetting alarms, when the bedwetting is bothersome not just to the parents, but to the child. And the child is really willing and ready to do something about it because they really need to be engaged in whatever treatment you choose. Medications can be effective temporarily for bedwetting. So they're a good option if kids are going to summer camp or they have a sleepover they want to go to and they don't want to take a pull-up along or something like that. Because what they do is they'll temporarily decrease the amount of urine and decrease the bedwetting that the child has. But when the child goes off the medications, most children tend to go back to just about as much bedwetting as they were doing before. The other option that families have is an alarm system. Most kids by the time they're seven or eight are developmentally ready to engage with a bedwetting alarm, which is basically a device that is attached to the front of the underwear. When it detects wetness it sets off an alarm and it wakes the child. The key for a bedwetting alarm to work is the child has to be engaged in this. So they need to be the one who gets up and turns off the alarm, who changes the bedclothes, reduces the bathroom and resets the alarm. So this really has to be them retraining themselves. Parents do need to be engaged in this because at first no seven or eight year old is going to want to get out of bed and turn off the alarm and change all the bedding. These kids tend to be deep sleepers and so the alarm will tend to wake up the whole family before it wakes up the bedwetting child first. About 70 percent of people who use them and use them consistently over several months will find that the bedwetting is gone. So this is the one that really will retrain the body and help to cure the bedwetting. Reassuring your child that the things you do in your sleep are not things that you choose to do. These are things that your body does without you controlling it and so it's not your fault if you're wetting the bed at night. And also reassuring kids that this is a fairly common thing, that lots of kids they know probably wet the bed at night too and just nobody wants to talk about it.",4,4,5,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,5,4," 4

AGQUSK7YTx4,"The most important thing for children to understand about bedwetting is that they are not alone. As you can see from the chart, 15 percent of 6-year-olds still wet the bed each night and even 2 percent of 15-year-olds continue to wet. Children always want to know, ""When am I gonna be dry overnight?"" Every year, 15 percent of kids will become dry on their own without any intervention. We just do not know when that magical time will occur for each individual child. So, it is our job to help children become dry before they do so on their own. Why does bedwetting happen? As you can see from the graph, there are many factors that contribute to nighttime wetting. The amount of urine that is made overnight by the kidneys may be more than the bladder can hold itself. The biggest reason has to do with the sleep cycle with children who wet overnight. These kids are sound sleepers who do not wake up to alarm clocks, thunderstorms, or smoke detectors. It makes sense that they wouldn't wake up to the sensation of a full bladder during the middle of the night. During an office visit for nighttime wetting, there is a lot of important information that we obtain, including family history of nighttime wetting, sleep pattern of your child, whether or not they are a heavy sleeper, whether or not there is snoring or sleep apnea associated with it. Even though your child may wet overnight, what occurs during the daytime can impact whether or not a child has a dry or wet night. A thorough daytime history is obtained. It is important for us to know how often your child urinates during the day. Do they even go at school, or do they wait until the last minute to use the restroom? We additionally want to know if there is any wetting going on during the daytime, even if it's simple dampness. A bowel history is additionally asked. We ask the children how often are they having a bowel movement. Is there any signs of constipation, including: large stools, painful-to-pass stools, or hard pebbly stools? We know that constipation can impact the amount of urine your bladder is able to store, and it is our goal for these kids to have a soft, daily bowel movement. A detailed history of your child's fluid intake is obtained, specifically, what and when they are drinking. Many children consume a very small amount of fluid during the school day and tend to fluid overload when they get home from school. Additionally, we ask whether or not fluids are limited before bedtime. To begin getting ready for dry nights, it is important that daytime habits are perfect. This includes making sure that your child is urinating every two to three hours during the day, with or without an urge to go. We stress the importance of using the restroom at school. We ask that children double void prior tobed. For example, if they generally go to bed at 9 o'clock, we ask that they empty their bladder at 8 o'clock and then 9 o'clock, right before they crawl underneath the covers. We ask that bowel movements are monitored to ensure that they are having an easy-to-pass, soft daily bowel movement. If this is not happening, we do recommend a stool softener. We discuss fluid modulation, meaning drinking more of the fluids earlier in the day, and then limiting fluids two hours before bedtime. Water is the best choice over juice, sports drinks or soda. We encourage one glass of water with breakfast, one at lunch, and one after school. Once the daytime habits are mastered, treatment options for nighttime wetting fall under two categories: medication or a moisture sensing alarm. The moisture sensing alarm is a device that the child wears during sleep. This is an excellent option for children as it is curative. The moisture sensing device is attached to the underwear with an alarm that is fastened to their PJs. Once the child begins to urinate, the moisture sensor causes the alarm to activate. Eventually, over time, this mechanism conditions the child to wake up to the signal of a full bladder. There are several companies that manufacturer bed wetting alarms. It is important to make sure that you purchase an alarm that does sound and does not simply vibrate. The second set of treatment options include medication. The first is DDAVP or Desmopressin. DDAVP is a synthetic hormone that is meant to concentrate the urine that is produced overnight, so your child can store a smaller volume of urine without having an accident. DDAVP works in about 50 percent of patients. It is important to understand that DDAVP is simply a Band-Aid to cover up the problem of nighttime wetting until the child outgrows it on their own. DDAVP does not need to be taken each night to be effective, and some children choose to use the medication for social situations, such as sleepovers or summer camps. It is ordered as a 0.2 milligram tablet with a maximum dose of three tablets before bed. It is initially trial and error to decide what dose keeps the child dry, whether it is simply one tablet or the maximum of three. If DDAVP is effective for your child, every three months, we do attempt to wean them off the medication to see if they are able to stay dry on their own. There are other alternative medications that can be prescribed if DDAVP alone does not keep a child dry overnight. Included in those are Ditropan® or Detrol®, which help an overactive bladder or a child who has a reduced bladder capacity. At times, the combination of both DDAVP along with the Ditropan or Detrol can keep a child dry overnight. The last category of medication is Imipramine, which is a tricyclic antidepressant and is used cautiously. In summary, it is important for children to know that they are not alone in bedwetting. It is an extremely common problem, but one that most children do not want to discuss. We will do everything possible to help your child stay dry overnight.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Exploration: The transcript of the YouTube video is about bedwetting in children and how to help them become dry overnight. The aims of the video are clear, as it explains the prevalence of bedwetting, the factors that contribute to it, and the possible treatments. However, the video could have been more concise and focused on the main points.

Reasoning: The transcript starts by addressing the common misconception that children who wet the bed are abnormal, and then proceeds to explain that 15 percent of 6-year-olds and 2 percent of 15-year-olds still wet the bed. This information helps to reassure children that they are not alone in their experience. The video then goes on to discuss the factors that contribute to bedwetting, such as the sleep cycle, family history, and daytime habits. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the child's daytime habits to help them become dry overnight.

PY5nb3RYDWg,"The first issue that we're going to talk about is a very sensitive issue. An issue of bedwetting. Bedwetting is something that affects the child, affects its family. It changes the mental status of the child and if not taken care of or approached in the right manner, can really trouble the child on a long-term basis. Hi, I'm Dr. Nihar Parekh and I'm going to be talking about the issue of bedwetting. Bedwetting is a problem which troubles the full family. The parents are anxious because they're worried about child. And the child is not able to get the child for the first time. And the child is not able to get the child. Bedwetting basically means any child who wets the bed in sleep. Maybe at night or even in the afternoon when the baby or a child goes to sleep. And the child is not able to get the child for the first time. Bedwetting basically means any child who wets the bed in sleep. Maybe at night or even in the afternoon when the baby or a child goes to sleep. We consider it abnormal if it continues to happen after five years of age. Till five years, you should not worry about it. After five years of age, when the children have bedwetting, in medical we call it as a Nocturnal Enuresis. There are two types. One is a primary and one is secondary. I will tell you something about primary. Primary means the baby never achieved a control over urination during sleep. That means the baby was never normal, has been wetting the bed ever since he was born. Up to five years, we find after five years it is abnormal. The primary Enuresis has many causes. The most important cause is a familial. We call it as a genetics. Now familial means there is always a history where a father, mother or somebody in a family had the same history and used to wet the bed when they were young. Number two cause is some structural defect. Maybe in the urinary bladder, maybe in the kidney or maybe in the spine. Some small mass in the spine or spina bifida we call, from where the nerves come which control urination are damaged or compressed and that is why the bedwetting can occur. There is a hormone known as antidiuretic hormone. In short, we call it as ADH. In a normal child, ADH level increases at night thereby reducing the urine production and preventing bedwetting. There are many children where the ADH level at night does not increase and that is why relatively there is more urine production in the night and child wets the bed. There are some children who are very deep sleepers. There is so much in the deep sleep they don't even get a sensation of passing urine and that is why they wet the bed. There is one more thing is the bladder's capacity is small and there is not proper coordination between the bladder muscles and the spinta and that is why they pass urine in the bed. These are a few common causes. I request Dr. Nihar to explain you about the secondary bedwetting. Thank you sir. So as Dr. Parekh explained the primary causes of Nocturnal Enuresis, I am going to talk about the causes of secondary Nocturnal Enuresis. The primary cause of secondary bedwetting means the child never used to wet his bed before, had a period of six months of no bedwetting but has suddenly started wetting the bed again in the night. This is secondary Nocturnal Enuresis. The causes of secondary Nocturnal Enuresis, the most important job that we have to do at that time is to rule out an underlying urinary tract infection which is one of the commonest causes of secondary Nocturnal Enuresis. Second is children with chronic constipation. They are straining at stool all day long, over a period of time, takes a toll over the muscles of the spinta, loosens them and then they start wetting the bed. Third and the second most common cause of secondary Nocturnal Enuresis are all behavioural issues. Stress of exams, stress at school, changes of environment in the form of change of school, change of residence, losing a very close family member, putting stress on the child. These are commonest causes in which the children start wetting the bed again. And sometimes very rarely it's related to behavioural disorders like ADHD, that is the attention deficit hyperactive disorder. So these are causes of bed wetting. This is what Nocturnal Enuresis is all about. It is a true test of patience of the child, of the parents. Though I think we should always get the right knowledge and the right help at the right time. One of the rare causes but a cause that we cannot afford to miss of secondary Nocturnal Enuresis is diabetes in children. This is how it is picked up for the first time. So it is a must not to take it lightly at whatever age it is. Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis, you have to meet the doctor. Tune into our channel, Child and You, for tips and guidance to raise a healthy child. Live now, live healthy, only with Shushruta.

S-hGcEjpcJ8,"Hello, I'm Renee. I'm a pediatric nurse practitioner who's been helping families with bedwetting for more than 20 years. If your son or daughter is over age 5 or 6 and still struggles with nighttime wetting, a bedwetting alarm will help. Bedwetting alarms sound when your child starts to wet so they can wake up to use the bathroom. This process teaches the brain to respond to a full bladder, even during sleep. Accidents will become less frequent and soon stop altogether. The most popular type of bedwetting alarm is the wearable alarm. The sensor clips to your child's underwear where you expect wetting to first occur. The alarm unit attaches to your child's shirt. As soon as wetting occurs, the alarm will sound and vibrate, waking your child. Wireless alarms are good for children who don't wish to wear an alarm. These use a special sensor in the underwear and an alarm receiver plugged into the wall. Some parents prefer to get dual receivers, one for their child's room and one for theirs. Bell-on-pad alarms are an older style of alarm where the child lies on a moisture sensing pad. With consistent bedwetting alarm use, most children achieve permanent nighttime dryness in 2-3 months.

ouUdrm-LlUc,"Hello, I am Dr. Girish Nalewegi from Nalewegi Multispeciality Hospital, Balandur, Bangalore. I am a urologist by qualification. The most important assessment tool for bed wetting in children is question answer session between the doctor and the parents. This is the most important way in which bed wetting in children is evaluated. The doctor assesses whether the bed wetting occurs only the night or in the day also. He also wants to know whether the bed wetting has never stopped or there was a period in which the child could control bladder and then after that there was a loss of control which means whether it is a primary condition or a secondary condition. He also will ask questions as to whether there is a pain while passing urine. He will assess the psychological condition of the child and so on and so forth. After that the doctor will carry out a physical examination of the child to see if the bladder is palpable or if there is a blockage of urine. He will also see and examine the external genitals to see if there is a condition called femosis which is a tight foreskin of the penis which precludes complete emptying of the bladder. He will also test for neurological problems in a child. After this he will advise you to undergo some basic tests like urine examination to rule out or confirm urine infections and ultrasound of the abdomen which is done to see the condition of the bladder, the kidneys and also to see whether there is blockage of urine, to see if there is any abnormality of the urinary bladder and to see if the child is keeping a very high bladder even after urination.

A-aSE0mMsRk,"Hello everyone, I am Dr Meera Raghavan, Senior Consultant, Urogynecologist and Robotic Surgeon. I consult at Apollo OMR, Beringudi as well as at Apollo Hospital, Greenslane. We will be now evaluating the most important problem of bed wetting which happens in children, young adults and elderly women. Bed wetting which is also scientifically termed as Nocturnal Enuresis is not an uncommon problem especially in children, young teenagers and elderly women as well. Why does this happen? Usually it happens because of an underlying bladder which is over active in its own merit which causes sudden release of urine when the patient especially is in deep sleep. Many of the time these women say that they have been dreaming that they have been in the washroom and thereby not able to control the urination and have a bed wetting episode. Children who suffer from bed wetting do have certain other reasons why they have this particular problem. Irregular drinking habits especially excess intake of caffeinated soft aerated drinks, caffeine and tea and improper toilet training habits usually are a precursor for such bladder related bed wetting issues. Children also can suffer from worm infestation which can cause bed wetting in them. Bullying, psychological trauma, sexual abuse and childhood abuse could be the underlying psychological issues why such children could suffer from bed wetting. Usually they come off these problems by the age of 12 to 14. However if they continue to do so we need to investigate further. We have had a case where a multidisciplinary team had been involved when a 15 year old continued to have 3 to 4 episodes of bed wetting in a day and we found that she was actually suffering from absent seizures by a neurologist who then treated her for that and she stopped having such bed wetting episodes. In the elderly bed wetting happens due to completely different causes. Mainly an innocuous symptom such as snoring could be the underlying problem why elderly women have Nocturnal Enuresis or bed wetting. Let us see how these two are interrelated. If somebody is snoring the tongue falls back and when the tongue falls back there is not enough oxygen supplied to the brain. This completely takes off the inhibition of the brain over the bladder and they lose control on the bladder. So snoring though being a very innocent symptom or something which can be ignored by many people could mean that the brain is not receiving enough oxygen and in the long run sub cumulative absence of oxygen during deep sleep everyday for long period of time can be a harbinger for stroke or multiple problems in the brain. So bed wetting and snoring are symptoms which should not be ignored and could mean that the brain is not receiving enough oxygen.",4,3,4,3,4,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video aims to discuss the causes and potential consequences of bed wetting in different age groups, including children, young adults, and elderly women. The video also highlights the importance of addressing the underlying issues that may contribute to bed wetting. However, the video could have been more concise and focused, as it covers a wide range of topics related to bed wetting, which may make it difficult for the viewer to grasp the main points."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. The speaker, Dr. Meera Raghavan, provides a comprehensive overview of the causes and potential underlying issues related to bed wetting in children, young adults, and elderly women. She discusses the role of bladder overactivity, irregular drinking habits, toilet training issues, worm infestations, psychological trauma, and snoring as possible contributing factors. However, the video lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult for viewers to follow the flow of information. Additionally, the speaker's delivery is somewhat monotone, which may reduce viewer engagement. Overall, the video provides valuable information on the topic, but could be improved in terms of presentation and delivery."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a common medical issue (bed wetting) and its possible causes and treatments. However, it is not a perfect fit for the question, as it does not directly address the medical expertise of the speaker or the quality of the information provided.

Explanation: The video provides some information about the sources of information used to compile the publication, but it is not very clear or detailed. The author, Dr. Meera Raghavan, mentions her professional background and the hospitals where she consults, which gives some credibility to her expertise. However, she does not explicitly cite any specific sources, studies, or references to support her claims about the causes and treatments of bed wetting. She does share one anecdotal case of a 15-year-old girl who was treated by a neurologist, but this is not enough to establish a clear and comprehensive source of information. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially' clear about the sources of information."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a detailed explanation of the causes and possible underlying issues related to bed wetting in children, young adults, and elderly women. The doctor explains the possible reasons for bed wetting, such as overactive bladder, irregular drinking habits, worm infestation, psychological trauma, and snoring. The video also shares a case study of a 15-year-old girl who was suffering from absent seizures, which was causing her bed wetting episodes. The doctor emphasizes that bed wetting and snoring should not be ignored, as they could indicate a lack of oxygen supply to the brain, which could lead to more serious health issues. The transcript is informative and well-organized, making it easy to understand the topic. However, it could have been more concise and focused on specific aspects of the problem."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The speaker provides a comprehensive overview of the causes of bed wetting in children, young adults, and elderly women. She discusses both physical and psychological factors that can contribute to the problem, and she acknowledges that some cases may require further investigation. However, the video could be more balanced if it included more information on the potential benefits of treatment or intervention for bed wetting, as well as the experiences of people who have successfully addressed the issue. Additionally, the speaker's focus on snoring as a potential cause of bed wetting in elderly women may be somewhat biased, as it is based on a single case study and may not be applicable to all individuals."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the causes and potential treatments for bed wetting, but it does not mention any specific sources of support or information for those who may be struggling with this issue. The video is mainly focused on explaining the medical aspects of bed wetting and its potential causes, rather than providing resources for those who need help or guidance."," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects. First, the exact causes of bed wetting are not fully understood, as the video mentions various possible factors, such as bladder overactivity, psychological issues, and snoring. Second, the video suggests that bed wetting in elderly women could be a sign of a more serious issue, such as insufficient oxygen supply to the brain, which could lead to other health problems. However, these connections are not definitively proven, and more research would be needed to establish a causal relationship. Therefore, the video partially refers to areas of uncertainty."," 2

UAuZte7iYM8,"Bedwetting is an issue that millions of families face every night. Usually it's not a sign of any deeper medical or emotional issues, and kids eventually grow out of it. Dr. Tony Kuri of Children's Hospital of Orange County offers parents solutions for their child's bedwetting problems. About 15% of children age 5 wet their bed, and that statistic decreases by 1% per year over the next 10 years. So that by the time the child is 15, still 1 to 2% of them are still bedwetters. And in adults, surprisingly, and that's something that most people don't talk about, about 1% are still bedwetters occasionally. Let's be very clear. Bedwetting is not really a disease. It's not an illness. Bedwetting is just a step in development that hasn't completed. Dr. Kuri describes the treatment options. The two common ways to treat it are by medication or by wetness alarm. I personally don't favor the medication. What the medication does, it's a medication that turns off the production of urine by the kidneys. Well, the kidneys is not where the problem is. The problem is communication between bladder and brain. Still a certain percentage of these children will urinate in bed, will bed wet, even with the small amount of urine that the kidneys manage to produce despite that medicine. The better solution is a behavioral modification, as a biofeedback system, whereas we put a little pad in front of the child's underwear. As soon as the child begins to urinate at night, a buzzer goes off, wakes the child, and by doing that process repeatedly for three to four weeks, it takes about three to four weeks for the brain to realize that it's not keeping track of the bladder at night. And that biofeedback system allows the bladder and the brain to talk to each other in the background at night, the same way they do it in the daytime. Dr. Kuri tells us the success rate of wetting alarms. The statistics with wetting alarms are excellent. Within three weeks, about 75% of the children manage to, A, respond to the alarm initially, so it goes in phases. In the beginning, they wake up as they're wetting, and then they wake up just before they're about to wet, just like anybody who sets an alarm for school sometimes wakes up before the alarm goes, and then they sleep through the night. We suggest that they continue to use the alarm for six months continuously after their last wet night. Again, bed wetting is not a disease. The kids are the smarter kids in the class. Give them lots of encouragement. Assure them that this is something that will stop spontaneously. Don't push your child to stop wetting unless the child is really motivated. Most of the time it's the parents that are pushing, and the child has no interest whatsoever, and so they don't react to the alarm. They don't wake up. It's not their problem. It's mommy and daddy's problem. The one other factor that has really made a big difference today is that pull-ups are so good these days, and they're so dry, that the kids don't mind being in them. So back off, or if you really want your child to be irritated by it, take them out of pull-ups, put them in underwear, and make them responsible to A, to do their laundry, B, to change the sheets, and then it will aggravate them, and maybe they'll be more interested in being dry at night. Using effective solutions for your child's bed wetting problems can mean a restful night's sleep for everyone. I'm Laura Windsor for the American Health Journal.",4,4,4,3,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, as it aims to inform parents about bedwetting, its prevalence, and possible solutions. However, the video could have been more concise and focused, as it contains some unnecessary details and repetitions."," 4

Explanation: The video achieves its aims partially. It provides information about bedwetting, its prevalence, and the fact that it is not a disease or an illness. It also offers two common treatment options: medication and wetness alarms, with a preference for wetness alarms. The video also gives advice on how to encourage the child and make them more responsible for their bedwetting problem. However, the video could have provided more details on the medication option, such as its side effects and potential risks, and could have discussed other possible treatment options or alternative solutions."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a common issue that many families face and provides information on the causes and potential solutions for bedwetting. The video also features a medical expert, Dr. Tony Kuri, who offers advice and treatment options for parents. However, the video could be improved by providing more recent statistics and research on the topic, as well as addressing other potential causes of bedwetting beyond the communication issue between the bladder and the brain."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about bedwetting, its prevalence, and the possible treatment options. However, it does not explicitly mention the sources of information used to compile the publication, other than the author. The author, Laura Windsor, is a medical journalist, but the video does not cite any specific medical or scientific sources for the information presented. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially,' as the video provides some information about bedwetting, but does not clearly indicate the sources of information used to compile the publication."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a good overview of bedwetting, its prevalence, and the different treatment options. However, it could have been more precise in some areas, such as specifying the source of the statistics mentioned. Additionally, the video could have provided more context on the expert's credentials and the date of the video's production."," 4

Explanation: The video is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it presents different perspectives on bedwetting and its treatment options. However, it does have some biased elements, such as the statement that bedwetting is not a disease or an illness, which could be seen as downplaying the issue for some people. Additionally, the video seems to favor behavioral modification and wetness alarms over medication, which could be seen as promoting a specific treatment approach. Overall, the video is mostly balanced and unbiased, but it does have some biased elements that prevent it from being a perfect 5."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the success rate of wetting alarms, the importance of behavioral modification, and the role of pull-ups in managing bedwetting. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that can offer further assistance or guidance. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, it states that bedwetting is not a disease or an illness, but rather a step in development that hasn't completed. This implies that there is some uncertainty about the exact cause or nature of bedwetting. Second, it mentions that the problem is communication between the bladder and the brain, but does not provide a clear explanation of how this communication breakdown occurs or why it affects some children more than others. Third, it suggests that behavioral modification and biofeedback can help treat bedwetting, but does not provide any scientific evidence or data to support these claims. Finally, it advises parents to be patient and not push their children to stop wetting unless they are motivated, but does not offer any guarantees or assurances that the treatment methods will be successful for every child. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty in its discussion of bedwetting and its treatment options."," 4

Explanation: The video describes two common treatments for bedwetting: medication and wetness alarm. It explains how the wetness alarm works and its success rate. However, it does not describe how the medication works in detail, only mentioning that it turns off the production of urine by the kidneys. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes two treatment options for bedwetting: medication and wetness alarm. It explains the benefits of the wetness alarm, which is behavioral modification and biofeedback system, and its success rate. However, it does not describe the benefits of medication in detail, only mentioning that it is not the preferred option. Therefore, the video partially describes the benefits of each treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video describes the risks of one treatment, which is the wetness alarm. It explains how the alarm works, its success rate, and the duration of its use. However, it does not describe the risks of medication, which is another common treatment option. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video does not explicitly describe what would happen if no treatment is used, but it does provide some information about the natural progression of bedwetting. It states that bedwetting decreases by 1% per year over the next 10 years and that most children eventually grow out of it. This suggests that, without treatment, bedwetting may improve over time, but it does not provide a clear picture of the potential consequences or outcomes of untreated bedwetting. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains the benefits of using wetness alarms and behavioral modification to treat bedwetting, which can lead to a better quality of life for the child and their family. However, it does not discuss the potential drawbacks or side effects of medication, nor does it explore how the child's self-esteem and social interactions might be affected by their bedwetting."," 4

gQBt-EP8gNs,"Evening guys and welcome back to my channel. And you're probably all wondering, what is Nocturnal Enuresis? Well to put it in basic terms for you to understand, it is called bed wetting. Which obviously involves wetting the bed during the night. Which is something that I have dealt with all my life. So out of 2-3% of people over the age of 18 plus, they suffer with Nocturnal Enuresis. Now there's two types of Nocturnal Enuresis. There is a primary Nocturnal Enuresis and there is also a secondary Nocturnal Enuresis. The short name for Nocturnal Enuresis, instead of saying the long word, is NE. Or for primary Nocturnal Enuresis it's PNE. For secondary SND and so on. Out of 5-10% people, bed wetting is caused by the development of the bladder. It's not necessarily anything to do with medical. Sometimes it can be medical related. Other times it's more found that it's actually family history orientated. So it runs through the bloodline, for example grandparents and grandparents, cousins and so on. Well I'm in the category of the primary, yes, I'm the primary Nocturnal Enuresis. Which means I have never had a prolonged period of having a dry night. I'm wetting the bed every single night, without fail. But if I was a secondary Nocturnal Enuresis, which means I've had a long period of time where I've gone without wetting the bed and then unfortunately I've started again. But in my case I've always wet the bed, I've never had a dry night. So unfortunately it is something that I have dealt with all my life and there has been a lot of help. Over the years of having bed wetting I've been asked what treatments have I used, what therapies have I been recommended and so on and so forth. Well from as far as I can remember when I was younger my doctor told me that I could be prescribed this certain tablet. Now forgive me I don't know what the name of this tablet was, I've forgotten because it was many years ago. And they recommended to my mum that she sits at the end of my bed and watches me just drifting off into her sleep. Well with that she would then have to prescribe me the medication. I'm not 100% keen on that because I'm half asleep, my mum's got to try and wake me up, give me a tablet and then I go back to sleep. So the process of that was pretty awkward, frustrating as such because you just wouldn't want to go to bed. But having to be given it as soon as you go to sleep, that was a bit hard to deal with. My other treatment that I had when I was around about 7, yeah around about 7 I was given the opportunity of trying out the alarm. Well my opinion on the alarm was horrible to be truthfully honest, I don't know what else to say apart from the fact that it was really annoying. It was a little, what can I say, it was like a little pad which would then be attached to a long wire which would then be attached to a little box. That little box would then get clipped to my pyjamas along with the string that would go through my pyjamas and into a pair of underwear with this thing in between. So as soon as a bit of urine of course touches that alarm, it sends the alarm and it starts going off. Which then obviously wakes me up and then I can go to the toilet and finish what my body had started in my sleep. Well after a while that didn't get any useful because I got used to the sound of the alarm. So when I wet I didn't hear it so then my mum would then get woken up by the alarm and then she'd have to come in and tell me. Well the next morning obviously I've woken up dry, not realising that my mum has actually come in, helped me go to the toilet and then I've gone back to bed. So within that time frame I've then woken up and gone, yay I'm dry, I'm dry. When it's like no darling you actually, you know you nearly had the accident but so on and so forth. So that was quite awkward. I have also tried protection as in protective sheets, plastic sheets, also protective dry nights as what they call them. Well they get called different nappies, diapers, dry nights, anything really. I have also tried them which I also tried when I was around 17 to 18. But obviously at that age you're wanting to experience more, go out more so how could I possibly do that with me wearing a nappy? So that was kind of downgrading for me but I got there in the end. I actually had a partner who encouraged me to protect and that was really reassuring. And now I'm actually on a medication and if I don't take this medication I will have an accident so it is literally I've got to take it every night because if I don't I wake up wet. The other day I actually went to sleep, I had a little nap around about 5 o'clock. Well because I wasn't actually going to bed I didn't take my tablet which obviously then meant when I woke up after having an hour, hour and a half nap obviously I'd had the accident and had to change. So it doesn't matter when I go to sleep, I could go to sleep 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I could have a nap at 12 and it would happen then so it doesn't matter if it's at night although it's called Nocturnal Enuresis it happens regardless even if I'm asleep throughout the day I will then obviously have the accident. Having Nocturnal Enuresis has been a struggle, it has been isolating at some times because I didn't go on school trips as you heard in my last video I didn't participate in anything that I should have as an individual like everyone else. I felt like because I'm the bed wetter I'm in the wrong and I'm not normal but the thing is I'm just like everyone else and it shouldn't change me and I think the reason why I'm doing this video is because I don't want others to feel like they have to hide themselves because I know what that was like and I've missed out on so much like I didn't go to trips to Wales or go on a 6 week trip to a different country to help them with the school I didn't get to do that because I didn't have the right mindset then to think well hang on a minute no I can do this and guess what you can, you can do this I know you can because I can, I didn't think I could do it but I mean I've done it I've flicked that lid off the bottle and I've done it and I wouldn't turn back because no matter how much hate I may get from this it's not going to bring me down and it shouldn't bring nobody down either I mean I'm just glad that I'm doing this and encouraging people to feel like they're not on their own because for years I felt like I was on my own and I shouldn't have and unfortunately I felt like I was on my own from people that didn't understand I felt like I was on my own from professionals that did understand but didn't want to put me in a category because of my age so unfortunately because of treatments and things I got the help that I needed but I didn't get the personal help to deal with it like I got told oh yeah you've got an undeveloped bladder you've got Nocturnal Enuresis blah blah that's it you know there was no really I heard that you could have surgeries and things like that but I've never been offered that because they don't see it as a medical condition they see it as they they go by what you drink how many cups of tea you've had throughout the day how many fizzy drinks you've had what certain food you eat when you eat them do you eat them past a certain time so they do like to they don't put their eggs all in one basket which is absolutely fantastic that that's grand but",3,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 3

363ObJffZQc,"Hi, in this video I'm presenting my work on the analysis of prescribing trends among children with Nocturnal Enuresis based on large-scale claims database in Japan. This is a disclosure slide. There are various guidelines available for the treatment of Nocturnal Enuresis in children, but the study on how children are actually treated is still limited, especially in Japan. So in this study, we examined the real-world pharmacological prescribing trend using the large-scale claims database in Japan. Here is the methods. Our research design is a retrospective observational descriptive study. We utilized one of the largest medical claims databases in Japan, and the study period was over 15 years. In this study, we defined children as under 16 years old. The diagnosis was confirmed based on the ICD-10 and the Japanese disease code. The target drugs included are all shown in the slide. We obtained the approval from the university's IRB. The selection of three different study cohorts for each analysis purpose are shown. From the original cohort of 23,000 registered children, we identified those who received the diagnosis at least twice to eliminate the possible suspected cases. There were about 3,500 children, and we analyzed the overall prescribing trend. For newly diagnosed, due to the limits in space and time, the detailed algorithm is not shown here, but we identified just over 3,000 children, and we analyzed the first prescribed age. Finally, we selected those who underwent at least 12 months of follow-up and analyzed the initial medication choice. The first result here is the overall prescribing trend. Please note that the data for 2019 is not shown because our data was only available till March, not a full year. The top figure shows the proportion of children being not medicated with Nocturnal Enuresis medication is decreasing. This means that we are, but slowly, inclined to prescribe. The bottom bar shows the breakdown of prescribed drugs by drug class. We can see that, especially in the last five years, from 2012 and onwards, desmopressin remained the most commonly prescribed. This actually coincides with the timing of the introduction of desmopressin to the lingo tablet formulation in Japan. The other drugs, anticholinergic, remained quite consistent in the 30s range. On the other hand, tricyclics decreased steadily overall. The results of the first prescribed age is shown here. On average, children were prescribed with Nocturnal Enuresis medication at the age of eight. When we looked into the formulation of desmopressin, over 80% were prescribed sublingual tablet compared to the nasal sprays or drops. Here we look at the initial medication prescribed. Because there are many drugs available within the same class rather than drug class, the table shows the list of individual medication commonly prescribed. Again, desmopressin being the most commonly prescribed initial medication at 45% to 1%, followed by imipramine 24.1%, propivirin 17.6%, and so on. In conclusion, we reveal the proportion of children being prescribed with medications for Nocturnal Enuresis was generally on the rise each year. Regardless of drug class, the initiation of pharmacological treatment was most frequently observed at around eight years of age. In recent years, desmopressin became the mainstay treatment, especially when the sublingual tablet formulation became available. This time we look at the trends, but in the future, we hope to conduct the study that will examine the impact of each pharmacotherapy as well as no pharmacological therapies on children's outcomes. This is the end. Thank you for watching.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

hS_CdE_yJDk,"My name is Doctor Randy Hyde I'd like to talk about Diurnal Enuresis or daytime wetting. That is different than bed wetting or Nocturnal Enuresis. And the way it's different is, with Diurnal Enuresis it's a completely different dynamic. What happens is a child has a functionally small bladder. Not necessarily organically small or physiologically small. But the bladder is like a little water balloon. And, if you remember blowing up a balloon for the first time, man it's hard. You know, you're having to blow as hard as you can. The second time it's much easier to blow that up. Well, a Diurnal Enuretic bladder is very small and it's covered with very precious sensitive nerves. So that when the bladder expands, it pushes on these nerves and gives the kid this immediacy, ""Oh, I've got to go, I've got to go!"" And for daytime Enuresis it's very, very urgent because it hasn't expanded or desensitized. So, it might hold a thimble full of urine and the kid's like, ""Ah, I've got to go, I've got to go!"" So, with Diurnal Enuresis, you might find, man they are urgent, they've got to go right now, and they're running to the bathroom and half the time they don't make it. That's because as it expands, it becomes painful, you know, when your bladder feels really full. And they can't hold it because their sphincter, the little gate through which the urine passes, is generally weak.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

FYlEsQydfUI,"Alright, we've got Daisy on the line now and you've got a question about your six-year-old. Good morning, Daisy. Oh, Daisy's not there. Let me read what she said. She said, My six-year-old is having real issues with night time. She is in a nappy every night and wakes up wet every morning. My doctor just dismisses it. I don't want her to take medication. Do you have any practical advice? Well, what Daisy's daughter is experiencing is what we call Nocturnal Enuresis, so the wetting of the bed. It's actually very common. One-third of children can get it. And simple patients' reassurance does actually, it does heal with time. Sometimes it takes up to the age of seven onwards to actually diagnose it, and there's a number of causes for it. It can be familial, so if your parents have ever had wetting at night, the child has a 30% chance of getting it. And also, it's your own growth and development. The bladder is just getting used to actually stretching, and sometimes it's later developing signs of, well, my bladder's full, I need to go to the urine, go to pass urine. There are simple things that we can do, so you can ask Daisy's child to kind of control the amount of water she drinks before going to sleep, encourage her to go and pass urine a couple of times before going to sleep, and just positive reassurance. So if she does wet the bed, then instead of getting a bit upset, just helping her in part of the process of changing the bed sheets, because that all interacts with the child, helps them with their nerves as well. Not making it a big issue. Exactly. Should you keep those sleep nappies on at night, or should you take them off and keep changing the bed every night? What's the best thing to do? Does it make them lazier if they have those, or is it better to do that, because then they haven't got the thing of wetting a bed? I think it reduces the motivation to need to stay dry if you're wearing the nappies. If you know that, actually, I'm going to wake up in the morning, it's all going to be contained in a nappy, there's no motivation to actually need to try and keep dry. So in my opinion, I would trial at least the time without the nappy, and then, you know, intermittently keep going back to it if it does keep failing. But there are also brilliant bed wetting alarms that you can try. So it's like a pad connected to an alarm. As soon as the pad gets wet, it wakes your child up, she's then aware, and she'll be able to feel what it's like to have a full bladder, and then that becomes subconscious throughout the night as well. That's good to know. Okay, great. Thank you.",4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4," 4

z2HeopBUuP0,"Hi everyone, this is our weekly blog and one of the questions that has been asked of me many times is how I treat bedwetting in children or incontinence at night. Or incontinence during the day or bedwetting at night or incontinence at night, all that kind of situation. Well of course it depends on the pulse. Now generally these types of people, whether they're children or adults, fall into two categories. Either they're the bedwetting or the incontinence is due to weakness or it's due to excessive heat in the lower burner. If it's excessive heat in the lower burner, the right surer pulse will definitely be strong and pounding. It can be pounding at depth or pounding a little bit higher, but it's strong. This is heat in the bladder and the kidney system. And those people, you actually have to strip the heat out to stop the urgency. That's easy to do. You just use Bajung San and then depending on what the rest of the pulse looks like, you can add something else, like something for the liver, maybe 20% for the liver if the liver is screwed up. But the predominance of the formula should be to take away the heat in the lower burner. It's very simple and the problem will get better immediately. You can add astringence.",2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2," 2

ThnGEZj_0OU,"Bedwetting is a very common thing that happens in children. Most children can achieve daytime dryness around four years of age. However, a lot of children still have some bedwetting for a few years after that. Fifteen percent are usually still wet between five and seven years of age. That decreases after seven years of age until even as a teenager, one to two percent of the population still has some occasional bedwetting. At this point, we have several contributing factors. One of them is genetics. If your parents were bedwetters for years after they achieved daytime dryness, then it's more likely that a child will be also having trouble with bedwetting. Other things that also contribute to it are whether the maturation of their spinal cord as it gets the ability to tell the child to wake up and go to the bathroom at night, or the size of the child's bladder. Some children have very small bladders and they can't make it all the way through the night without getting up to go to the bathroom. There can also be some changes in the hormones in the body such as vasopressin, and if that is out of balance, the child can have some trouble with bedwetting. There are other things like psychological stresses in the home. One common scenario is that a child is starting to learn to toilet train and then a new baby is brought home. That can be very stressful for the child and a lot of times they can have trouble with bedwetting after that sort of situation. If your child is in the age range of three to six years old, the best thing to do is just provide reassurance. There's not really a whole lot that you can do at that point for helping the child's bedwetting. About 15% of the children per year will spontaneously grow out of it on their own. It's not necessary to scold the child about it because they're not doing it on purpose. It's also really important that we don't physically punish the child because they do not want to wet the bed, they just don't really have control over it at that point. Once a child is at least six years old, the problem that develops is that they become embarrassed about the bedwetting. They don't want to spend the night at a friend's house or they're afraid to go away to sleep away camp, things like that. And when bedwetting becomes a social issue, then there's some more things that we can do to try to help it out. First of all, you want to try to do simple things such as restricting how much fluid they're drinking at night. We want the majority of their fluid intake to be in the morning and afternoon. You want to remind them to go to the bathroom before they go to bed, which can help decrease the amount of bedwetting they have. After that, you can try motivational things such as a sticker chart. If they are dry for a night, they can put a sticker on the chart. And if they have seven nights in a row with stickers on them, then they get a prize such as a book that they want. After three to six months of trying sort of behavioral interventions to resolve the bedwetting, other things can be tried such as a bedwetting alarm, which can be successful in a large percentage of children to achieve long-term dryness at night. Or some children need a prescription medication occasionally to help resolve the bedwetting. If your child has additional symptoms, there are some times that you need to see the doctor before just trying behavioral changes at home. Some of those symptoms would be if they have been dry at night for over six months and then they start wetting the bed again, they should see a physician. Or if they complain a lot of burning when they are urinating or changes in their urine color or smell, they should see a physician. If they start drinking a lot more water than they used to drink and they are very, very thirsty, they should see a physician. Or if you are otherwise concerned that there might be any other health problem that they might have, you would want to see a doctor for that. Bedwetting can be a frustrating thing for parents to deal with. And it's also frustrating for the children. And it's just really important to emphasize that they are not doing it on purpose. But that recruiting them to help, so having them help to clean up at night so that they can change the bed covers, that they can change their outfit and help get things into the laundry can actually recruit them to feel positive that they are helping to solve the problem and sometimes that can be helpful to resolve the bedwetting too.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

4YmJF178uS0,"Usually, one in five children wet the bed by five years of age and when it goes to ten years it can go down to one in ten and roughly one in fifty can continue to wet till puberty and sometimes into early adulthood. Bed wetting is more common in boys than girls and there is no defined pathogenesis however it is assumed that girls tend to be maturing faster and that's how they escape having the less burden of this. There are multifactorial reasons, some children can inherit it, so about 40% of children can have hereditary or familial enuresis. It is supposed to be autosomal dominant in latest studies. Most commonly, the reason for enuresis is delayed bladder and brain coordination, so the bladder is not maturing enough to send the signals, or brain is not maturing enough to receive the signals. However it can be secondary sometimes to other factors such as kidney or bladder defects, neurological issues or sometimes even emotional and psychological issues such as bereavement in family, or arrival of a new sibling or sometimes even child abuse. Yes, the treatment consists of various modalities, and it initially starts from behaviour reinforcement, which includes reward charting, and behaviour modification. So when we say that, behaviour modification, is about empowering the child to be aware of their problem and take more initiative into it, such as being engaged in the linen washing or changing the linens, having more discussion with their parents, so not be shy or shameful about it and the reward is mostly confined around the behaviour rather than the outcome. So they should be rewarded for having more liquid intake or going to the toilet at regular intervals and there should not be any negative criticism when they are getting the reward system in that process. Then it comes to the stage of interventions, and when we talk interventions, there are a couple of things that start from the alarm, which is a enuresis alarm, water sensitive alarm, and that basically works by the moment they have a little drip of urine output the mattress gets triggered and it starts creating a loud alarm, waking up the child to go to the toilet, and this basically conditions the mind and improves their bladder and brain co-ordination. The other modalities is medication which can be desmopressin, it is an external hormone basically to give an initial surge of vasopressin which works by diminishing urine production at night and we all have it but in these children sometimes this surge is missing. So we give desmopressin externally through oral route and in other conditions where the bladder over activity is involved, then we can go for anticholinergics, such as oxypertine or tricyclics. These are the main management modalities and it depends on what category the child is falling into, so if the child is having lack of arousal, which is not responding to the full bladder sensation, mostly around early morning, then we use the alarm, if it is polyuria where they are producing urine leak in the day time with no surge of vasopressin then we give external vasopressin in form of desmopressin and if there is a bladder involved with over activity or spasms in a small functional capacity, then we use anticholinergics and sometimes other medications.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,2,4,5,4," 4

Primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy. Persistent bedwetting, that is bedwetting that occurs at least once a week or more, is typically not considered to be a problem until your child reaches school age. Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis, on the other hand, occurs when a child or adolescent has maintained proper control over their bladder during the night for at least six months or more and then begins to wet the bed again. Secondary bedwetting accounts for approximately one in four of all bedwetting cases, with the number of children with secondary bedwetting increasing with age.

Even children with no history of petriwetting may lose their bladder control from time to time. Petriwetting may appear or increase when a child is ill. Although the reasons of petriwetting may vary from child to child, there are some common reasons why a child might with the bladder size. Kidney or bladder problems are rarely the cause of petriwetting in older children after ages 3 to 4. However, it appears that some children who with the bed have relatively small bladder that cannot hold much urine. Neurologic issue. Some children maybe have nervous system that are not sufficiently developed to get the right signal between a bladder and the brain. For these children, it's just a matter of time until the brain develops enough to solve the problem. Genetic and Family Factors. Petriwetting appears to run in families. Approximately 75% of children with petriwetting problems have a parent or sibling who has had a similar problem. In addition, the abortion prison takes towards a later training where children can cause petriwetting. Hormones. Recurrent research suggests that some children who with the bed maybe lack sufficient level of important hormone. Psychological Cause. Sometimes petriwetting can be a response to stress such as emotional conflict or anxiety. The child is experienced psychological and other mental health professionals' regulatory reward that children begin with the bed during time of conflict at home or school. Dramatic changes in home and family life also appear to lead some children to with the bed moving to a new town.

Now, we will talk about the treatment and solutions for Nocturnal enuresis. First, exercise and bladder training through delaying the urination a few minutes after the first sensation that the bladder is full. To stretch the bladder and stopping the urinary flow midstream to strengthen bladder muscles. Two, psychotherapy can be effective treatment for children's wetting problems if their wetting appears to be a reaction to family changes like birth a new baby, stressful situations like school problems or an emotional or traumatic events like divorce. Three, give your child a half cup of fresh cranberry juice to stop bedwetting.

Five, massage the bilbous and bladder by using heated olive oil and rub it over your child lower abdomen gently for several minutes to increase the capacity of the bladder. Six, avoid giving the kids chocolate or junk food or soda in the evening and limiting the fluids especially water during the evening.

Eleven, anytime the child is dry in the morning feel them how great they are congratulate them and tell them you are getting to be a big boy or girl. Don't use punishment with kids who experience Nocturnal enuresis through reprimanding or abuse or hitting them because this lead to complicated the problem. Which strategy should we use? Choosing the best treatment for your child's wetting problem depends on a variety of personal and lifestyle factors. Research generally support the use of moisture alarms as the best approach for curing bedwetting in the long term. This approach also eliminates the risk of side effects from medication and is generally the most cost effective strategy. Using moisture alarm in combination with psychotherapy may be the best option if children are having behavioral or emotional problem along with their wetting problem. However, some families prefer the convenience of medication and their ability to reduce bedwetting relatively quickly if they are effective. Such decision should be made with the guidance of physician and or mental health professionals specializing in the treatment of children and aware of all treatment option available.

Dz1skaI421g,The topic is what's bed wetting and are known as Nocturnal Enuresis you know. Now the bed wetting is medically termed as Nocturnal Enuresis and there are two types of bed wetting primary bed wetting and secondary bed wetting. Primary bed wetting is bed wetting since infancy you know and primary bed wetting is due to delay in the maturing of the nervous system you know. It's an inability to recognize the messages sent by the bladder to the sleeping brain so as a result this primary bed wetting happens you know and the cure for primary bed wetting is the passage of time so it goes away itself as the time passes and the infant shall get mature you know. There are number of interventions including medical and behavioral options just to cure the primary bed wetting you know. The secondary bed wetting is the wetting after being dry for at least six months so if the child is mature enough and he is not bed wetting and then after the six month gap it restarts the bed wetting it's called secondary bed wetting you know. Secondary bed wetting is due to a routine infection sorry urine infections or diabetes and other underlying medical conditions you know. And the one thing that should keep in mind that all the bed wettings whether it's primary or secondary these are manageable and you need to speak to your child physician for further guidelines and treatment options.

KOmNnmrN2sk,"So there are a number of things with bedwetting. One, the point that I would want to make is that first of all, we don't really get concerned about it when kids are pretty young. It's pretty normal for kids to even wet the bed up to age 10. So if you're concerned about it and it's becoming impactful, like a child can't go to sleepovers, there are a couple of different options. One option is a medication called DDAVP and that's something you'd want to talk with a physician about if you were interested in that route. The other option that is empirically supported is what's called a bedwetting alarm. And the way the bedwetting alarm works is that it has an alarm and sensors in the underwear that when it is wet, it sets off an alarm. So it wakes the child up when they are actually wetting the bed. And over time, what you want to have happen is that they start waking up to actually that urge that they need to go. It does take a good amount of time, but it really teaches kids how to be able to stay dry all night.",4,4,4,2,4,4,3,2,4,4,2,2,4,5,4," 4

cQEEKmdtCy8,"My name is Dr. Randy Hyde. I want to talk to you about the physiological basis of nocturnal enuresis, or bed wetting, night time bed wetting. It's a biological factor, that is, has a physiological basis. And the physiological basis is deep sleeping. So you have a child that normally, a normal child that doesn't have bed wetting, normally, they go through four stages of sleep. The first is, they go down just a little bit into sleep, it's barely even recognizable as sleep, second a little further, third a little further, and fourth is deep sleep. And then they come back up, and then they go back down, then they go back up and back down. We all go through this circadian rhythm, or different stages of sleep. That's a normal process. For a child with enuresis, what happens is they start out, and they go down into the first stage, rush into the second, quickly through the third, and then they bottom out into a very, very deep level of sleep. It's just this side of comatose. Not really, but seriously, very deep sleep. So what happens, is the brain is getting the signal from the bladder, ""hey, I've got to go, please wake up, man, wake up, I got to go, wake up, wake up! Oh, too late, again!"" And the child will wet the bad. That's what happens. Is they are so deeply asleep, that the brain isn't picking up that signal.",4,3,4,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

uGknlSJp7Sw,"Hi, it's Dr. Nancy Muller, Executive Director of the National Association for Continence, opening the mailbag from our headquarters in Charleston, South Carolina. Well right now, I'm actually standing in Waterfront Park at the foot of the beautiful and majestic Ravenel Bridge right behind me. Next time you're in Charleston, be sure to visit the park. One of the most frequently asked questions of us, and one of the reasons that people most frequently visit our website, is to ask about bedwetting in the older child. Over five million children over the age of five suffer from bedwetting and haven't quite mastered staying dry at night. First and foremost, never scold your child for bedwetting. Be very positive and supportive once you begin implementing a strategy to help them overcome this problem. Certainly 44 to 77 percent of children who have one or more parents are more likely to have problems with bedwetting if their parents had problems with bedwetting as older children. So there is a genetic factor associated with it. It's important to get to a doctor and rule out any medical problems that could be associated with the symptoms, such as a urinary tract infection as the underlying causal factor. But there are substantial causal factors that do need some strategizing if there are no medical problems, such as a bladder that has a smaller capacity or the tendency to produce more urine at night. Make sure your child is properly hydrating throughout the day and not taking all their liquids just before going to bed. You might even restrict those liquids before bed as long as they've had enough liquids throughout the day. There are also medications and there are even bed alarms. We have lots of information on this, as well as recommendations for a great book. Contact us at 1-800-BLADDER or visit our website, www.nafc.org.

OkEU5_ultYk,"Any parent who's gotten up in the middle of the night to change their child's sheets will tell you bedwetting can be troubling for the entire household. But what can be done about it? Dr. Noor Balthaji, a pediatrician with advanced training in nephrology at Essentia Health in Fargo, says parents shouldn't be concerned about bedwetting before the age of about five. If a child older than that is wetting the bed, there are several possible reasons why. Genetics. They're more likely to wet the bed if one or both parents did. Delayed maturation of the bladder and nervous system. They have a small or hyperactive bladder, a urinary tract infection, or they're drinking too much before bedtime. Sometimes constipation is causing bladder pressure. Dr. Balthaji says bedwetting is physically pretty benign, but psychologically it can lead to behavior issues and low self-esteem. These kids, many times they don't socialize, they don't want to go for sleepover, they don't want to go to summer camp exactly for this reason. Dr. Balthaji says parents can try to stop the bedwetting on their own by encouraging their children to eat more vegetables to alleviate constipation and also limiting foods that make them thirsty. Also consider a beverage budget of sorts. Let kids consume 40 percent in the morning, 40 percent in the early afternoon, and just 20 percent in the late afternoon. If that doesn't work, Dr. Balthaji says to see a physician who might prescribe an anti-diuretic pill or suggest you use a bedwetting alarm, which sounds with the first drop of urine. The bedwetting alarm, it is kind of a conditioning treatment. It will tell your brain to inhibit the bladder reflex. Dr. Balthaji says most children will outgrow bedwetting, but the worst thing parents can do is punish the child for it. That does not help. The kid will have more low self-esteem and it doesn't help because it's not their fault. With this Essentia Health medical insight, I'm Tracy Briggs.",4,4,4,4,4,5,3,2,4,4,3,4,4,5,4," 4

mmIJZMy725s,"Bedwetting, Nocturnal Enuresis. What is Enuresis? The medical name for not being able to control your pee is Enuresis, pronounced, en-u-re-sis. Sometimes Enuresis is also called involuntary urination. Nocturnal Enuresis is involuntary urination that happens at night while sleeping, after the age when a person should be able to control his or her bladder. Involuntary urination that happens during the day is known as diurnal Enuresis. Most of us think of bedwetting as something that happens with little kids. But this problem affects about 1-2 out of every 100 teens. What happens in Enuresis? There are two kinds of Enuresis. Someone with primary Nocturnal Enuresis has wet the bed since he or she was a baby. This is the most common type of Enuresis. Secondary Enuresis is a condition that develops at least six months, or even several years, after a person has learned to control their bladder. The bladder is a muscular receptacle, or holding container, for pee, urine. It expands, gets bigger, as pee enters and then contracts, gets smaller, to push the pee out. In a person with normal bladder control. Nerves in the bladder wall send a message to the brain when the bladder is full. The brain then sends a message back to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the person is ready to go to the bathroom. But people with Nocturnal Enuresis have a problem that causes them to pee involuntarily at night. What causes Enuresis? Doctors don't always know the exact cause of Nocturnal Enuresis. But they think that these things may play a role. Hormonal Problems A hormone called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH, causes the body to make less pee at night. But some people's bodies don't make enough ADH, which means their bodies may make too much urine while they're sleeping. Bladder Problems In some people with Enuresis, too many muscle spasms can prevent the bladder from holding a normal amount of pee. Some teens and adults also have relatively small bladders that can't hold a lot of urine. Genetics Teens with Enuresis often have a parent who had the same problem at about the same age. Scientists have identified specific genes that cause Enuresis. Sleep Problems Some teens may sleep so deeply that they don't wake up when they need to pee. Caffeine Using caffeine causes a person to pee more. Medical Conditions Medical conditions that can trigger secondary Enuresis include diabetes, urinary tract abnormalities, problems with the structure of a person's urinary tract, constipation, and urinary tract infections – UTIs. Psychological Problems Some experts believe that stress can be linked to Enuresis. Doctors don't know exactly why, but more than twice as many guys as girls have Enuresis. It is often seen in combination with ADHD. The doctor will do an exam, and ask you about any concerns and symptoms you have, your past health, your family's health, any medicines you're taking, any allergies you may have, and other issues. This is called the medical history. He or she may ask about sleep patterns, bowel habits, and urinary symptoms, such as an urge to pee a lot or pain or burning when you pee. Your doctor may also discuss any stressful situations that could be contributing to the problem. The initial exam will probably include a urinalysis and urine culture. In these tests, urine is examined for signs of disease. Most of the time in people with Nocturnal Enuresis, these test results come back completely normal. How is Enuresis Treated? Doctors can do several things to treat bedwetting, depending on what's causing it. If an illness is responsible, which is not very common, it will be treated. If the history and physical exam do not find a medical problem and the urine tests are negative, several behavioral approaches can be used for treatment. Manage What You Eat and Drink Before Bed. People with Nocturnal Enuresis can take some basic steps to prevent an overly full bladder, such as decreasing the amount of fluids they drink before going to bed. You can reduce the chances that you'll wet the bed by going to the toilet just before bedtime. It may help to avoid eating foods that can irritate the bladder. These include coffee, tea, chocolate, and sodas or other carbonated beverages with caffeine. Imagine Yourself Dry. Using a technique called positive imagery, where you think about waking up dry before you go to sleep, can help some people stop bedwetting. Some people find that rewarding themselves for waking up dry also works. Use Bedwetting Alarms. Doctors and nurses sometimes prescribe bedwetting alarms to treat teens with Enuresis. With these alarms, a bell or buzzer goes off when a person begins to wet the bed. Then, you can quickly turn the alarm off, go to the toilet, and go back to sleep without wetting the bed too much. It can take many weeks for the body to unlearn something it's been doing for years. Eventually, you can train yourself to get up before the alarm goes off or to hold your urine until morning. People who sleep very deeply may need to rely on a parent or other family member to wake them up if they don't hear the alarm. The key to bedwetting alarms is waking up quickly, the sooner a person wakes up the more effective the behavior modification for telling the brain to wake up or send the bladder signals to hold the pee until the morning. Sometimes, doctors treat Enuresis with medicine. But no medicine has been proved to cure bedwetting permanently, and the problem usually returns when the medicine is stopped. Doctors sometimes prescribe a man-made form of ADH to decrease urine buildup during the night. Other medicines relax the bladder, allowing it to hold more pee. If you're worried about Enuresis, the best thing to do is talk to your doctor for ideas on how to cope with it. Your mom or dad can also give you tips on how to cope, especially if he or she had the problem as a teen. The good news is that it's likely that bedwetting will go away on its own.",5,4,5,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 5

S8DY1y54mho,"A lot of people will be able to relate to this, bedwetting. So it's not just happening to babies like the sweet one we saw just off the top after the commercial break, but it happens when you get a little bit older and it's quite common. So we want to talk about how you can deal with this in a way that's not going to shame anybody and have everyone feeling good about themselves still. So your first tip, it's common. It's common. So curious, we are a safe sharing group here this morning. Put your hand up. I'm a million viewers. Put your hand up. No shame if you actually were at some point a bedwetter. Oh come on! I'm the only one! Thank you sir! Let's give him a round of applause! Thank you! Thank you! Absolutely! Your partner's mortified that you just put up your hand, but you know what? I am so, thank you! I think that's really good. There's nothing wrong with that guys. It happens. It's just a wet bed. Big deal. Yeah. It's a good thing I think that we have to understand what's happening. It's very taboo still. It's kind of taboo. Not in my world. You asked me, I was like, oh yeah, I was a bedwetter. Yeah, but you're very open. Yeah, no big deal. I saw people going like this. Yeah, I saw that. But yeah, no it is. It's something that's kind of looked down upon. Right. Yeah. So rule number one, tip number one, is it's very common. Yeah. It's very, very common. And I find one of the best ways, one of our little guys experienced it, and I found one of the best ways is just to share a story about it. Kids love stories. They love to know that, yeah, mommy went through that too, daddy went through that too. They just love that story. So tip number one is making sure that kids actually know that it's very common. Right. And when we talk about bedwetting, we are talking about when they're sort of school age getting a little bit older, right? Because obviously your young kids, your toddlers are going to wet the bed. They don't have those controls yet. Yeah. Okay, so tell them a story. Share. Make sure they know that you've been through it and it's not that big a deal. The other thing is privacy. A lot of parents want to tell the fun stories at the family events about what's the one that they like to be sharing at the family get together. So there's a difference between privacy and shaming. You've got to be really careful around this, right? So I think it's really very important for kids to know that this is something that's private within our family. There's nothing wrong with it, but it is something that's private. Because some kids, if that information got out to their school or their classmates, they could be really teased about it. So it's really important that you don't want to have shame around it, but you do want to encourage them to actually have privacy for them. But also even as a, I don't know if I would actually be telling aunts and uncles or grandparents unless you thought that they would be okay with the information. You really have to kind of trust your gut in terms of how safe those other people are that you'd be actually telling. Absolutely. Like if you're comparing stories or trying to make another little cousin feel better. Maybe, but yeah, you've got to gauge that for yourself. Very important. Be practical. So there's certain things you probably don't want to be doing right before bedtime, right? Yeah, very important. I mean, I'm going to be focusing more on the emotional side versus the physical side, but I was actually just chatting with Dr. Joey about this earlier and she was actually saying it's genetic and I actually had not heard that before. So that would be kind of interesting in terms of the physical side, but from the emotional side, a couple of things may, you just, well, I'm very practical around the approach for this. For one of them is you just want to make sure that you're actually limiting water. So with one of our guys, when this was his experience, we just made sure that he had lots of drink at dinner time, but then after dinner we kind of cut off any liquid and that seemed to make a big difference. Huge. Huge difference. So just really practical things because you know, their bodies are actually going to respond to it. On an emotional level. So, um, you know, I remember it being a big deal when I was growing up wetting the bed and so I've always tried to remember that when I deal with my own kids and not make it a big deal because it's not really a big deal and you don't want them to feel humiliated or anything like that. What you need to keep in mind emotionally. So you want to make sure that you're saying it's not a big deal. It's extremely common. Let's do with what we can. Let's go talk to our healthcare provider, making sure that, cause I do like to kind of get that physical side kind of on, on, on par. But you also as a parent want to be really attuned to with what's going on with your kid's life. So for some kids, especially the ones that are sensitive, they will, they hold all those emotions in and if they don't know actually how to deal with it, it comes out in different things. So it will come out nightmares, can come out in tantrums, it can come out in terms of them actually losing some self control. So you just want to kind of be really where what else is going on in my child's life? Is it just simply a physical issue or is there an emotional component? And the best way to do it is you just want to pay attention, pay attention. And then when you actually go see your healthcare provider saying this is with what's been going on, my son or my daughter, they've had this change of friends or he's been teased or she's been teased, that all, all those kind of pieces will actually help your healthcare provider to really know how to respond. I guess sometimes it's also just excitement, right? Yeah. Right? That could be, that could be a trigger. I love this tip, use humor. Oh my goodness. Humor is so good. Yeah. Tell them that grandpa, grandma wears them too, you know, like, you want to just kind of have fun with it. I think the key thing is you want to dress it, not shame them, but I have a lot of fun with it as well. And kids love that. They'll actually respond really well to that. They do.",4,4,4,2,4,3,4,5,2,2,2,2,4,4,4," 4

xHi6ISkkC1M,"Today, we'll be discussing Enuresis. What is Enuresis? Enuresis is a condition where children that should be dry at night still wet their beds. This often happens in a child that is not the first in their household, but also a child that perhaps has other illnesses or other conditions, or it might happen in a child that's otherwise completely normal, doing well at school, and actually has no other social or medical issues. Which then brings us to the question, why do children develop Enuresis? Enuresis starts because of a few factors. One of the important factors is reduced arousability. So these children sleep fairly deep, and when their bladders are full at night, they actually struggle to wake up and then go to the loo. Another factor that plays a role is increased nighttime urine production. So this is literally where the kidneys produce more urine while the child is asleep, and that then fills the bladder. We also know Enuresis is an important component of the bowel. So addressing bowel problems like constipation often leads to resolving the Enuresis. I think it's also important to stress the fact that the definition of Enuresis includes children from five and onwards. So any child that still wets their bed below the age of five technically does not have Enuresis. What are the management options for parents that are often frustrated? A child that's perhaps seven or eight going to school, going on camps, that really want to get a child dry at night. We usually start with conservative management options, and this would include addressing the amount of fluid that a child consumes before bedtime. So what we usually advise parents here is to limit the amount of fluid that a child takes with dinner at night. And then when the child goes to bed, make sure the bladder is empty. So taking the child to the bathroom and making 100% sure that all urine has been avoided. Other than that, there's also the alarm system, which is in essence a little bed the child sleeps on. And then when there's a little accident during the night, this then wakes the child with an audible alarm. This then creates a positive feedback or positive reinforcement, which then helps children to wake up the moment before they start leaking, before they start passing urine. There are medical options, or medicine options for children that have Enuresis, and the most common that we prescribe is usually DDAVP, which is the hormone that is normally secreted by the brain at night and actually reduces urine production at night. We know from statistics that the majority of children actually become dry by the age of 12 or 13. And only 1% of children still struggle with wetting their beds at the age of 60. In essence, this is a benign condition that is self-limiting, that is easily remediated and easily treatable, and the majority of children respond well to medical management such as DDAVP.",4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,4," 4

A bladder that squeezes when it shouldn't might empty during sleep. 3. Are there clues in how much and what is being drunk? What's put into the bladder influences what comes out. So drinking plenty of water-based fluid during the day should prevent thirstiness at bedtime and help the bladder to hold more while we sleep. 4. Could the bedtime routine hold the key? There are ways to help the body and mind prepare for sleep, including stopping drinks an hour before bedtime, having a screen-free bedtime routine and going to the toilet just before settling down to sleep. There's lots that can be done to treat bedwetting. Look for all these things in all children. If bedwetting continues to be a problem beyond the age of five, children should see a doctor or a nurse. They can assess the reason for wetting and give advice on specific treatment.

B2WXxgwJG7c,"Dr. Melissa Arka, aka Dr. Mom, is joining us this morning. This morning we're debunking the myths of bedwetting. And you sent along some interesting statistics, including 15% of kids who are five or older still wet the bed at night. Usually 85% of those kids will kind of figure it out. Yes. Mother nature kind of helps them figure it out. Yes, without any intervention that usually resolves on its own and usually by the time they hit puberty. Is bedwetting really genetic? It is. It's a strong genetic component. We know that children who have parents or a close relative that bedwet, that they have a higher incidence of it. But really it's a combination of factors. That they produce more urine at night, they have smaller bladders, and that they are deep sleepers. So that combination kind of ends up leading to the bedwetting. We also know a lot more now than maybe our parents even did about kind of the long term effects if you don't handle it well. So let's talk a little bit about your suggestions for what parents can do, how they should handle it. I think that's the biggest thing because I think there's been a big misconception that the children can actually control it, that they have some control over it. And they really don't. The kids don't realize that it's happened until they wake up and they realize they've wet the bed. So I really like to tell parents to not put guilt or shame onto them and also to not feel guilty themselves. It's nothing that they did and it's really no one's fault. It's just a matter of genetics and the combination of factors that we talked about. Let's talk about how you can speed up mother nature a little bit. And there are some things that are out there on the market now that may help, including potty alarms. What's that? Well these are, I like to, these potty alarms are something that attaches to the child's underwear and whenever it senses any wetness an alarm goes off. I mean it's not, it doesn't sound great. But what it's supposed to do is train the child's brain and bladder to communicate and to train it over a course of several weeks for the child to wake up once they sense that full bladder. Those are good for children who are motivated, six and older, and who really are feeling like I really want to get some control over this. So they need to really be showing the initiative on that. Limiting fluids and waking up before you go to bed, minimal impact. Yeah, really I know. Some children it helps and some really it doesn't. I mean if you limit the fluids, those children will probably still wet the bed but just a smaller amount. So if it helps, great. If it doesn't, you know, then there's really no sense in closing those restrictions. Alright, you can see more of Dr. Mom's awesome tips. You'll see them at casearea.com, session morning news, some of her previous segments too. Thank you very much. You're welcome.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,2,4,3,4,3," 4

CJ-2isjBfa8,"Good morning friends, we can easily naturally cure bed wetting to a certain extent. Now why bed wetting is occurring? One of the most common thing happening in children is constipation. Most of the babies are constipation. They put lot of pressure, lot of pressure, lot of pressure. And the size of the rectum is getting bigger and size of the bladder which is just in front of that is getting smaller. Eventually urine passes very frequently and the baby will have bed wetting. First of all you need to do is decrease the size of rectum by frequently giving normal food and avoiding certain foods like apples and bananas and milk and milk products and bakery items. Rice, white rice, curd etc. These are highly constipating things. You can add on Amrud what is called Guava and brown rice, brown bread, prunes which is called Aloo Bukhara and grapes. These things will cause isab gold which is called Ficilium husk. These will cause increased amount of stools and eventually within few months the size of the rectum will decrease and constipation will be taken or automatically bed wetting will be taken. Babies having bed wetting should take more liquids in addition to what normally takes before 6 pm. Take lot of liquids. Force them to take liquids before 6 pm. After 6 pm not even a drop of water. You need to over hydrate the body before 6 pm and after 6 pm not even a drop of water. Whatever is in the food that is enough. Third thing, buy around 11 o clock in the night, get them to toilet and make some pass urine. Fourth thing is you can do it at 2 am in the morning also put an alarm and put it. Fifth thing is you put stars in the calendar. In dates which baby is not passing urine at night next morning you put star. When there are few stars in the calendar give him a small gift not very costly gift. 5 rupee, 10 rupee gift. So that they will be encouraged to control it. In the morning time when the baby is wanting to pass urine divert their mind and ask them to hold a bit. Change the topic ask them to count till 10 or something. Fifth thing is you can make a urine measurement diary. You measure the urine in the beaker at least on weekdays when the baby is at home. And eventually make a diary out of it. Eventually the doctor will get an idea how much is the bladder volume of the baby. And accordingly we can prescribe medicines. Before that giving medicines is not logical. We give medicine the behaviour of the baby is not changed. Water habits are not changed. Control habits are not formed. It will be a big failure. You can also start some homeo medicines or ayurvedic medicines. These are safe. Our medicines are a bit costlier but we want proper calculations and proper behavioural changes before starting and jumping on to any medicines. Medicine might be costing around 4-5 months of treatment might cost you about 5-6 thousand per month or even up to costly medicines higher doses 10 thousand per month for about 3-4 months. It can easily be controlled. Earlier it is a better cook. No problem. Later also it is all in the mind. Change the habit. Reduce this milk products and everything. It will improve. Take care.

norO25hnz8g,"Bedwetting is very normal, first of all. Up to about age seven is where, after about age seven is where we start to say it's a little bit less abnormal when we look at the spectrum of how many kids are still having bedwetting problems at night. So we start to not really do any interventions until at least age seven or later. This is something you want to talk to your pediatrician about or your family practice provider about and kind of determining other questions because there can be a lot of other confounding factors that contribute to it like constipation. It's also very familial. So if there's a family history of bedwetting, it's about 40% chance likelihood that your child will also bedwet. And the age that the parent was able to become continent or not have any more bedwetting doesn't always correlate with when the child will as well. There's really some things that can help and be successful. And the most successful is called the bedwetting alarms. One brand that I like that I get no endorsements for is called the Wet Stop 3. There's lots of different types and you can go on lots of different websites, the bedwetting store, Amazon, many, many different places where you can buy different varieties. But it's consistency. And if you're using it consistently, it takes about a month or so of it being consistent before you can try to retrain their bladder. So initially they'll start, they're going to urinate, it will wake them up, then you get up with your child, take them to the bathroom and put them back to bed. Also not making a big deal about it like you're already doing can be very helpful. But slowly they will have less and less where they're waking up and already being wet and more waking themselves up. And it can be an exhausting process. But really the key to it being successful is consistency and you getting up with your child when they urinate, helping them try to completely empty their bladder if they hadn't when they had the accident can be more successful. There's medications that you can also use. These have less success long-term wise, but they can be very helpful. I like to use them for sleepovers and things like that so the child doesn't feel like they can't go and engage in these activities with their friends because they're afraid they're going to have an accident. This is again something you should talk to your provider about.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,2,3,4,4," 4

N_m8axjvHa4,"My name is Doctor Randy Hyde and I have Amy with me, appreciate you being here. We're going to talk about Diurnal Enuresis or daytime wetting. Randy, tell me is daytime wetting the same thing as a child that just forgets to go? Leaves it to the very last minute, maybe they're busy playing, and they just don't bother to go to the toilet. I know a lot of parents that just say, ""I know my child knows, but they just are to lazy to go."" Yes, too lazy to go. You know, and some kids are like that, but not a kid who has Diurnal Enuresis, not at all. It is out of their control. They have this urgency. It hits them like a freight train, ""Ahh, I got to go, I got to go!"" And, they may only have three seconds before they can make it to the potty in time to go to the bathroom. It's not laziness, it's not any of those things, it's that urgency. Because their bladder's small, covered with nerve fibers, and as soon as that starts to expand, ""Ahh, I've got to go!"" And then it's all over for them. So it's an immediate thing? It is, it's immediate. And, you know, bless their little hearts, it's humiliating for them. So, Randy, could you just sum up the difference between night time bed wetting and day time wetting. Yes, night time bed wetting is, actually, deep sleep. Where a child is so deeply asleep that their brains aren't getting the signal from their bladders, and that's genetic, physiological. Day time wetting, or Diurnal Enuresis, is when there is a functional small bladder and a weak sphincter, or gate, in which the urine passes. And, so that, there is this tremendous urgency, ""OH, I've got to go, I've got to go!"" And, often, it's too late.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, as the speakers explain the difference between daytime wetting and bed wetting, and discuss the causes and experiences of Diurnal Enuresis. However, there are some parts where the explanation could be more precise or detailed, such as the exact mechanism of the weak sphincter or gate, and the genetic or physiological factors that cause night time bed wetting. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video does a good job of explaining the difference between daytime wetting and bed wetting, and it addresses some common misconceptions about the condition. However, it could have provided more information about the causes and treatments for Diurnal Enuresis."," 4

Additionally, the video could benefit from including more information about treatment options and when to seek medical help."," 2

Explanation: The video is not very clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The transcript mainly consists of a conversation between two people discussing daytime wetting and its differences from nighttime bed wetting. While they mention that daytime wetting is not due to laziness, they do not explicitly cite any sources to support their claims. The video could have been more informative if it had provided some references or studies to back up their statements."," 4

The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a clear explanation of the difference between daytime wetting and nighttime bed wetting, as well as the causes and experiences of the children affected by these conditions. The medical expert, Doctor Randy Hyde, answers the questions posed by the interviewer and provides a detailed description of the symptoms and differences between the two conditions. However, the transcript could have been more clear if it had provided some examples of how the children with Diurnal Enuresis cope with the condition and what treatments are available for them."," 4

Explanation: The video is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it provides information about Diurnal Enuresis and differentiates it from a child who simply forgets to go. However, there is a slight bias when the speaker refers to the child with Diurnal Enuresis as having a ""tremendous urgency"" and that it's ""too late"" for them to make it to the bathroom. This language may be perceived as negative or judgmental, which slightly impacts the balance and objectivity of the video."," 2

The video provides some information about Diurnal Enuresis, but it does not mention any additional sources of support or information. The video focuses on explaining the difference between Diurnal Enuresis and other types of wetting, but it does not provide any resources for parents or caregivers to seek further help or guidance."," 2

Explanity: The video does refer to areas of uncertainty, as it discusses the difference between daytime wetting and bed wetting, and explains that daytime wetting is not due to laziness but rather a small bladder and a weak sphincter.

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The transcript does not explicitly mention treatment options, but it does discuss the differences between daytime wetting and nighttime bed wetting. By understanding the differences, a medical expert can infer that there may be different treatment approaches for each type of incontinence."," 2

The video provides some information about Diurnal Enuresis, but it does not explicitly discuss shared decision-making. The medical expert explains the difference between Diurnal Enuresis and other types of wetting, but does not involve the patient or their parent in the conversation.

Bedwetting is caused by drinking too much liquid before bedtime. This statement is fiction. In general, we do not recommend that kids who have nighttime wetting avoid water. Kids who drink less tend to become dehydrated. Kids who are dehydrated have more concentrated urine, which can lead to irritation of the inner lining of the bladder. They're also more likely to develop constipation. Constipation can irritate the bladder as well, leading to wetting.

nWdUeCVpMfo,"Hi there, I'm Alex and I am 27 and I want to talk to you about my experience with bedwetting as an older child. I, to the best of my recollection, I was bedwetting until about age 12. And then I finally stopped. And I just want to share with you what it's like, what it was like for me being, you know, a near teenager with this bedwetting problem. Because it caused me a lot and a lot of stress and I think it's good for people to understand and to know that they're not the only ones out there. So, I remember I would wet the bed all the time. I probably have a small bladder, whatever. Anyway, it was really awkward because as I got older, it's like I didn't want my friends to know. Because like how embarrassing would that be if you're like an 8th grader or 7th grader or 6th grader and your friends found out that you had to wear pull-ups or big diapers to bed every night. And so I would try things like not drinking as much liquid. I think that would help. But I would just wake up all wet in pull-ups and it was gross and I felt upset at myself. Because it was something I didn't feel like I could control, really. Even when I tried and I was worried about it. One thing I was worried about was like, what if I get married? And I have to wear diapers. They're like, this is so awkward. No one's going to want to marry an adult who has to wear diapers or whatever. Anyway, I had all these. Those were some stressors that I had. I felt embarrassed about it. I think a couple of my friends, next door neighbors who I'd hang out with, they found out about it. And maybe a couple other random friends. But it wasn't something I wanted all my friends to know and for me to be teased about at school. And yeah, luckily it just kind of happened naturally as I started becoming a teenager. Maybe my bladder started growing bigger. But I was able to stop wetting the bed. And it hasn't been an issue. It hasn't been an issue since my teenage years. Since I overcame it. But I guess some things you could do to maybe support someone who has bed wetting, an older child who has a bed wetting problem, is to just not bring it up. Or if they bring it up, just treat them normally. Don't tease them about it. They may or may not be sensitive to it. Likely they will be a little sensitive about it. Especially if you tell other friends. I wouldn't tell other friends. I'd let your friend do that if they want to. But honestly, I don't think most teenagers and younger are so socially mature that they can talk openly about their problems. Without fear of their friends judging them or making fun of them. So I'd just say be nice to them. It might be tempting to tease them about wearing diapers or pull-ups. But I wouldn't. It would help them feel better and to cope with it. Because, you know, more than anyone else, they don't want to have that problem. And to some extent they can control it maybe by not drinking liquids. But in another extent they can't really control it if their blood is really small. It might be they want to but their body just doesn't wake them up. They just go wet without waking up. And then they wake up and they feel awful and they get upset at themselves. And they feel self-conscious and depressed and kind of angry at themselves for not being able to be potty trained at night time. Anyway, so that's my experience with bedwetting as a teenager, right before teenage years, right around the beginning of adolescence. And I hope if you or your child has bedwetting issues, you know, just be patient with it. As far as I understand, the vast majority of people outgrow it naturally. Some people do it as a toddler. Some people outgrow it when they're 10 or 11 or 12 or 8 or 9. And just to be patient with it and to explain to them that it's normal. They don't have to feel like they're broken at all. It's just a normal thing that happens. Their body is just growing and some people it takes longer because their bladders are smaller or their ability to hold in urine and liquid isn't as high, as good as maybe other people's. So, anyway, I hope this video has been helpful. If you have any experience that you're willing to share or things you've learned about bedwetting, feel free to leave it in the comments section. I'd be very curious to hear what your personal experience or insights are. I don't understand it completely and I'd be very interested in learning more. Alright, thank you so much.

1o8NjTQeFEE,"Hi everybody! Today I'm going to do a quick video for Sandra on night time bed wetting. Well children will wet the bed for one of four reasons. Number one, the environment. Number two, they're failing to respond to the message from their bladder telling them they need to wee. Number three, they're making way too much urine. Or number four, the bladder muscles are failing to keep the urine in check overnight. Now notice I said well children, so if your child has any of these symptoms, then this video could not be applied to them and you really should take them to a doctor to be reviewed. Now stay with me and I'm going to go through each of the four reasons to help you figure out which one applies to your child. Number one, the environment. Now this is easy to fix once you identify it. Sometimes something as simple as moving house or getting a bunk bed can make it difficult for a child to get to the bathroom in time and they tend to wet the bed. So it's worth sitting with your child and working out why they think this may be happening and that may be all you need to do. Number two, they're failing to respond to the message from the bladder telling them they need to wake up. When the bladder is full, it tells the brain that it's time to go and wee. Now sometimes if your child is a deep sleeper, they may not be able to respond to this message from the brain and after repeatedly trying to get the brain to wake up so they can go to the bathroom, the bladder just gives up and just lets it go and lets it flow. Number three, making too much urine. As you prepare to go to bed, your brain produces a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH which helps you concentrate your urine so you don't make as much urine while you're fast asleep. Without adequate levels of this hormone, you make lots of dilute urine and need to wee and eventually wet the bed. Making adequate levels of ADH is a developmental stage and some children will take longer than others to get to that point. But ADH production can also be affected by being emotional and worked up and stressed or by not having a bedtime routine so you're just not sending your brain any signals that it's time to go to bed or drinking a lot of fluid before bedtime. Number four, bladder muscles failing to keep the urine in check. I love that. Now this can happen in one of three ways. First of all, their bladder may be too small. As we grow, our bladder has to increase in size but like a balloon, unless you fill it with urine, the muscles are not going to stretch and the bladder volume is not going to increase. You can work out your child's expected bladder volume for their age by asking them to drink a 500ml bottle of water or juice and sitting tight until they are absolutely desperate to go to the bathroom. Then when they wee, measure it in a jug and use this formula to work out how much urine you would expect them to wee according to their age. This formula cannot be applied to children above 12. Your bladder doesn't just keep growing exponentially. The bladder may be overactive. On top of the bladder are muscles that tell the brain when the bladder is nearly full and it's time to go to the bathroom. When you have an overactive bladder, these muscles are sending random messages to the brain when the bladder is nowhere being full telling the brain that it's time for you to go to the bathroom. These children tend to go to the bathroom frequently and they often just pass a teeny weeny dribble of urine. Weak pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles that lie under the bladder and are supposed to help the sphincter keep urine within the bladder until it's an appropriate time for the urine to be released. Children with weak pelvic floor muscles may have some dribbling during rough and tumble play, trampolining or laughing. You'll notice that these children often have a wet patch in the daytime as well as night. So, I hope this video has helped you work out why your child is bed wetting at night. Once you know why, it's a lot easier to identify which strategies and interventions are going to work for your child. I hope you've enjoyed the video. Let me know what you think and once again, thanks for watching. At Doctor V.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4," 4

za28q6FVP9A,"Hi, this is Onis from Amerijim.com Today we are going to talk about bed wetting We are going to discuss 5 new ways to get rid of bed wetting But before we proceed please do not forget to subscribe to our channel Also don't forget to click that bell notification icon So I can keep on sending you a new video every time I upload one Ok, back to 5 new ways to get rid of bed wetting So what is bed wetting? We all know that bed wetting can be both uncomfortable and embarrassing for a child Thankfully almost all the kids will eventually outgrow it as time goes on But chances are that you as a parent will feel compelled to do something while you wait So that is why today we are going to talk about 5 different ways to get rid of bed wetting Number 1, don't praise and don't punish Well, if your kid happens to wet his or her bed What you need to do is don't say anything, just don't say the word Just go ahead and change the bed You also need to realize that this is embarrassing for the kid and it is uncomfortable for them So don't say anything, don't punish, don't embarrass the kid Don't scream and yell at the kid, just change the bed and say nothing You know eventually that this is going to go away as time goes on On the other side of the coin, don't praise Let's say for a period of time the bed is dry, the kid doesn't wet the bed Don't call him or her and praise him, just don't say anything So don't praise when they are dry and don't punish when they are wet Number 2, change for the better To help minimize psychological stress, try as much as possible to rearrange the child's bedroom So that it will give them the opportunity to change the bedspread by themselves You can also help by setting out inside the room a felt covered rubber pad So that when he has an accident, he can actually lay this rubber pad over the wet part of the bed At the same time, he can also put out a pair of dry pajamas so that he can change into shooting case he has an accident Remember this is embarrassing for the kid and every time this happened to him or her, they felt really uncomfortable So by doing these two changes, there is a possibility that the child won't feel as if he or she has been treated like a child or like a baby That need bed change every time Number 3, about bed wetting alarms The question is, does the bed wetting alarm really work or not? They sure do work Bed wetting alarms can work but you better be patient when you use them The alarm is very loud and chances are good that they wake up everybody in the house when it goes off This is the way bed wetting alarm operates, it emits or rings out a sound when the child is wet The theory here is that the sound will condition him or her to wake up when he needs to urinate Eventually, wetting will be inhibited and bladder distention will become a signal for the child to get up if he is about to wet the bed You should realize that many children respond to this type of conditioning strategy within about 60 days It is important to know that bed wetting can be killed and bed wetting is considered killed when the child remains dry for 21 consecutive nights We have a lot of bed wetting alarms in the market, a lot of them, but you just have to compare the one that is better for your child Some of these alarms run on hearing aids and batteries and can actually trigger moisture sensors that are attached directly to the underwear of the child Try as much as possible to buy the new bed wetting alarm in the market instead of just sticking to the older one 4. Boost bladder muscles If you are a parent and you notice that your child's daytime pattern is one in which it goes to the bathroom fairly often Then there is a possibility that bladder stretching exercises may work Now this is the way to practice bladder stretching exercises If the child drinks a lot of fluid during the daytime, then practice bladder control by holding off urination for as long a period of time as possible This technique can be very effective and control bed wetting during bedtime 5. Show patience and support Now if you are a parent, you must understand that all kids outgrow bed wetting at the rate of 15% a year This means that by the time they go through the stage of adolescence, less than 1 or 2% will see wet the bed So be patient and be supportive You see, no kid wants to wet on himself. It is unpleasant, uncomfortable and cold And besides, only babies do that and no kids want to be a baby So, patience and support is the bottom line So understand, like I said, it is uncomfortable and embarrassing for the kid And there you go, the 5 new ways to get rid of bed wetting Please don't forget to visit our website at www.amirajim.com At the same time, please try to support this channel by subscribing to our channel In fact, I want you to stop what you are doing right now, whatever you are doing right now, stop And click on that subscribe button at the bottom of this video And at the same time, I'd like you to click on that bell notification icon So I can keep on sending you new videos when I upload one Thank you again and we see you next time",4,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

The speaker also acknowledges that some methods may work better for certain children than others, and encourages parents to be patient and supportive throughout the process."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting and five ways to deal with it, but it does not explicitly address shared decision-making. Shared decision-making involves involving the child or the parent in the decision-making process, considering their preferences, values, and goals. The video does not mention any communication or collaboration between the parent and the child, nor does it provide any guidance on how to involve them in the decision-making process. Therefore, the video partially supports shared decision-making, but not enough to warrant a higher score.",set(),43
q6HKwzjV1MU,"Another thing that might happen is bedwetting. Bedwetting is a little more common than people are aware because it's also a best kept secret. Not many people are running around and advertising that their child is bedwetting at the age of 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 years old. But bedwetting does have a relationship to how we're breathing and our quality of sleep. Some of the causes for bedwetting relate to the way oxygen is exchanged in our body. The way I'll describe it is this. If we're breathing through our mouth, that air coming into the lung isn't really filtered, warmed, or humidified appropriately, and the body can't exchange it appropriately. So a little less oxygen goes to the brain. Now the brain is a very sensitive organ. When the brain recognizes little changes in oxygen, it goes to work immediately. Because once the brain starts to recognize a little less oxygen, it doesn't know if we're being choked to death, a very serious condition, or if there's an imbalance in how we're breathing at night. But it does start to trigger a little bit of the fight or flight response. And a little bit of the fight or flight response means the brain's going to look at the body and say, all right, if we've got a little bit of an oxygen issue going on, I'm going to pull oxygen from something that it picks to be unnecessary right now and maybe deliver it somewhere that might be more important, planning on the rare occurrence as if the oxygen was going to stop. So if the brain's recognizing a little less oxygen, all of a sudden it's pulled from the urinary tract. If the body pulls a little oxygenation from the urinary tract, it might void. So we might wet the bed.",3,3,4,2,4,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,4,2," 3

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video discusses the relationship between bedwetting and breathing, and how oxygen exchange can affect the brain's response. However, the transcript could be more concise and focused, as it also includes some unnecessary information about people not advertising their child's bedwetting and the age range of bedwetting. The main idea is clear, but the presentation could be improved."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. It provides some information about the relationship between bedwetting and breathing, but it does not offer any solutions or recommendations for improving the situation. The explanation is somewhat clear, but it could be more detailed and supported by scientific evidence."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a possible connection between bedwetting and breathing issues. However, it is not a comprehensive explanation, and some of the information may be inaccurate or oversimplified. For example, the video suggests that breathing through the mouth can cause bedwetting, but this is not necessarily true, as many people breathe through their mouth and do not experience bedwetting. Additionally, the video does not address other potential causes of bedwetting, such as hormonal imbalances or psychological factors. Therefore, the video is partially relevant, but not entirely accurate or complete."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide any clear information about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author only shares their own opinion and explanation about the relationship between bedwetting and breathing. There is no mention of any research studies, scientific articles, or other credible sources that support the author's claims. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially' because the video does not provide any clear information about the sources of information used to compile the publication."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript explains the relationship between bedwetting and breathing, and how the brain responds to changes in oxygen levels.

g7QzciQKWXM,"It's a story that every parent knows, getting up in the middle of the night to change a child's wet bedclothes. Yes, bedwetting is part and parcel of this noble job. However, as most moms know, bedwetting isn't naughty, lazy or attention-seeking behaviour. Most often, bedwetting is a developmental issue. This means that most children wet the bed because they haven't yet mastered bladder control. As they grow older, the brain and the bladder will communicate better, even when they sleep, and will help them to wake up when their bladders are full. There may be other reasons too, such as constipation, deep sleep or low levels of a chemical that is called antidiuretic hormone, or ADH. This hormone regulates the body's water retention and plays an important role in how much urine the body makes. Sometimes, stress also brings on bedwetting, especially in older children. So be alert when you move house, have relationship problems, welcome a new baby into the family or when your child starts or changes schools. Most children feel embarrassed or ashamed by these mishaps. Don't make a fuss or reprimand them when this happens. Rather explain to them that it's normal and that as they grow and their bladders get bigger, it will eventually stop. Some simple steps can help you to manage bedwetting. Encourage your child to drink more during the day. Limit any drinks after 6pm. Make going to the toilet part of the bedtime routine and keep clear from caffeinated drinks. You can also put a waterproof sheet on the bed and let them wear washable waterproof underwear at night. Remember that teasing your child about bedwetting can make the problem worse. Some children may be too scared to go to the toilet in the dark. Give them affordable nightlight to make it easier for them to go to the bathroom. The good news is that most children stop daytime wetting when they turn 3 years. Nighttime bedwetting on the other hand usually only stops at 5. The secret is to be patient. Many preschoolers and even some primary school children will still wet their beds occasionally. It's also slightly more common in boys than in girls. Discuss your concerns with your general practitioner. The doctor may run some tests to rule out possible medical conditions. Also remember that emotional distress can cause children to start bedwetting all over again, for example from pressure at school. Doctors distinguish between two types of bedwetting, namely primary and secondary bedwetting. Primary bedwetting means that the condition has been continuous since early childhood without a break. Primary bedwetting starts again after a dry period of at least 6 months. The doctor may run some tests to rule out any possible medical conditions like urinary tract infection, diabetes or anatomical or neurological problems. In extreme cases, your doctor may recommend medicine or a bladder training programme. Counselling or even hypnosis can help children with emotional issues. You may also want to talk to your doctor about bedwetting alarms. These will alert your child and tell them to go to the toilet. This system also teaches them to wake up before they wet the bed. Praise your child for every dry night to boost their self-confidence. Remind them that bedwetting is nothing to be ashamed of, that many other children do it too and that it will soon stop. Remember, one of your most important duties as a parent is to ensure that your children feel safe and loved as they grow.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

P_q-IQwE3uI,"Hi everyone, this is Dr. Kacen with the Drugless Doctors. And one of the common things that we see in our office is kids that may have a Nocturnal Enuresis or bed wetting. And I don't know if you knew this, but chiropractic care can help with making sure that the brain is able to send all those messages down to let the bladder know that the bladder is full and the child needs to urinate. A lot of times parents don't realize that if the nerves are being compressed or what we call subluxation they may not be able to know that they need to wake up in the middle of the night and use the restroom. Now, something that I have right here is this is a case study that was done with the resolution of Nocturnal Enuresis and this was done in a 10 year old who was experiencing bed wetting for over 6 years after following a urinary tract infection which they did multiple rounds of antibiotics. After receiving her chiropractic adjustments, she was able to have the resolution of bed wetting and her parents, I'm sure, were really excited. So if you know anyone out there that may be dealing with this common challenge that may be embarrassed, maybe they don't know what to do, call our office at 440-471-4200 or check out our blog, we're a part of the ICPA, which is the International Chiropractic and Pediatric Association and we're here to help make a difference in your family.

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, as the speaker explains the issue of Nocturnal Enuresis (bed wetting) and how chiropractic care can help. However, the video could be more concise and focused, as it includes some unnecessary details, such as the phone number and the blog link. The main aim is to inform and potentially help parents of children with bed wetting problems, but the video could be improved by removing some of the extra information."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. It provides a case study of a child with nocturnal enuresis who experienced improvement after receiving chiropractic adjustments. However, the video does not provide any scientific evidence or research to support the claim that chiropractic care can help with bed wetting. Additionally, the video does not address potential risks or limitations of the treatment. Therefore, the video is partially successful in achieving its aims, but could be improved with more robust evidence and a more balanced presentation of the information."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses a specific condition (Nocturnal Enuresis or bed wetting) and how chiropractic care may help. However, the video is not very informative or detailed about the underlying causes of the condition, the scientific basis of the chiropractic treatment, or the evidence supporting the effectiveness of the treatment. Additionally, the video is promotional in nature, as it encourages viewers to call the office or check out their blog. Therefore, the video is not very helpful for someone who is looking for a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of the condition and its treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The video is not very clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author, Dr. Kacen, mentions a case study of a 10-year-old patient who experienced resolution of bed wetting after receiving chiropractic adjustments. However, there is no mention of any other sources, such as research articles, clinical trials, or expert opinions, that support the claim that chiropractic care can help with Nocturnal Enuresis. The video does mention that the author is a part of the ICPA, but this does not necessarily mean that the information presented is based on the organization's research or guidelines. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning that the video is only partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication."," 3

Explanation: The video is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a clear explanation of the problem of Nocturnal Enuresis and how chiropractic care can help. However, the transcript does not provide any specific details about the case study, such as the number of chiropractic adjustments, the duration of the treatment, or any potential side effects. Additionally, the video does not provide any evidence or references to support the claim that chiropractic care can help with bed wetting. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is not completely unbiased because it only presents the perspective of a chiropractor and does not mention any other possible treatments or causes for Nocturnal Enuresis. It also promotes the chiropractic practice and the International Chiropractic and Pediatric Association. While it does share a case study, it does not provide any scientific evidence or research to support the claim that chiropractic care can help with bed wetting. Therefore, the video is partially balanced and unbiased, but not completely."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the International Chiropractic and Pediatric Association (ICPA) and the chiropractor's blog. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help people dealing with Nocturnal Enuresis. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in two ways. First, it presents a case study of a single patient who experienced resolution of bed wetting after receiving chiropractic adjustments. While this is a positive outcome, it does not provide conclusive evidence that chiropractic care is effective for all cases of Nocturnal Enuresis. Second, the video mentions that nerve compression or subluxation may be a cause of bed wetting, but it does not provide any scientific evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the video partially refers to areas of uncertainty."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe how each treatment works. The speaker explains that chiropractic care can help with Nocturnal Enuresis by ensuring that the brain can send messages to the bladder, and that nerve compression or subluxation may be a cause of the issue.

Explanation: The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The speaker explains that chiropractic care can help with Nocturnal Enuresis by improving the communication between the brain and the bladder. The case study presented shows a positive outcome for a 10-year-old who experienced bed wetting for over 6 years. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, as it only focuses on one specific condition and does not discuss other factors that may influence the quality of life, such as emotional well-being, social interactions, or physical health."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor mentions that chiropractic care can help with bed wetting, but also suggests that there may be other solutions, as he does not claim that chiropractic care is the only solution. He also mentions that the child had a urinary tract infection and multiple rounds of antibiotics, which implies that medical treatment was also tried. Therefore, the video is not exclusive to one treatment option, and it is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the condition of Nocturnal Enuresis and how chiropractic care may help, but it does not provide any evidence or research to support the claim. It also does not mention any alternative treatments or discuss the potential risks or benefits of chiropractic care.

mJFOi_QBATM,"Bed-wetting, otherwise known as Enuresis, is very common. It, by five-years of age, is present in 15 percent of children. Eighty percent of children wet the bed because of a developmental problem. Their brain isn’t mature enough to send the signals to the bladder that they need to go to the bathroom. There are medical conditions and we do check for diabetes, kidney problems and also bladder dysfunction. Unfortunately, not a whole lot. I do tell parents to take their child to the bathroom before the child goes to bed and before the parents go to bed. Also, minimize fluids before bed time. I would say a parent should start investigating this issue at about five, five or six. So we can rule out medical problems and reassure the parents that it’s a developmental process. Each year the child will get better. There are a percentage of kids down from 15, so by 15 years of age, there is only one to two percent of the population that will have problems with wetting the bed.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3," 4

8JQ1o4E7sY0,"Nocturnal Enuresis, or bedwetting, is one of the most common pediatric health issues for children between the ages of 7 and 10. While some cases are caused by a hormone release cycle that is late to develop, studies suggest that most children who struggle with nighttime dryness simply are deep sleepers and don't wake up when their bladders are full. Their nervous system is slow to process the feeling of a full bladder, and accidents involuntarily occur. Statistics also show that only 5-10% of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations. In other words, about 90% of those who struggle with bedwetting can learn bladder control. Psychologists report that bedwetting can harm self-esteem and delay the development of social skills. Children who struggle with bedwetting are often teased by siblings, afraid that friends will find out, and embarrassed and frustrated by their lack of control. Use of the NITONE alarm conditions the user to recognize the need to urinate and wake up. In as little as two weeks, your child can overcome the shame of wetting the bed and be free to enjoy overnight activities, such as scouting campouts, sleepovers with friends, and trips away from home.

UXKw9yPus3M,"Well, if you have a little one at home, chances are you're still dealing with them wetting the bed. But what age should they be growing out of all of that? And what does it mean if your 6, 7, 8, or even 9 year old is still having accidents in their sleep? Dr. Mary Anne Lofromento is the author of the Simply Parenting series and she joins us now from New Jersey with all the answers. Dr. Lofromento, thanks for making a house call to Smart Family. Oh, my pleasure. Nice to see you. Hey, when do most children stay dry at night? Well, most children will stay dry at night by age 6. I think that's kind of the cut-off point for most doctors of what's normal. Anything, you can really start wetting, you can keep wetting the bed up until age 6 and it can be completely normal. Okay. And then what causes bed wetting? What really causes it, the most common cause is that it runs in your family. If a child is wetting the bed between the ages of 6 and 12, 13, then most likely either the father of the child or some other relative has also been wetting the bed. It's very common, more common in boys than in girls. And with each year, although there'll be a drop off of a percentage of children who will stop bed wetting, it can actually go on until about 12 or 13 in some cases. Wow. So genetic factors there are a big one. Can a child have just a small bladder? Yes, they can have a small bladder. They could sleep too soundly, that's another reason. They could have a slight abnormality of one of the hormones that keeps urine in. And occasionally stress can make a child start bed wetting when they've been dry. Okay, difficulty waking up, that can be another one, right? Yes. Yeah. And then slower than normal development and that always makes us a little bit nervous when you're talking about that because we're just not sure what's on par. So we're going to start at six and anything after that we'll talk about in a moment. Okay, so then let's go into what does not cause bed wetting because that's important too. Absolutely. I think that's the most important job I have when I sit down with parents. It is not your child's fault. They cannot control this. It is not a behavioral problem. So what are the treatments then for bed wetting? Because I know you can either talk medicine or you can talk behavioral. Let's do the behavioral first because parents can actually really help with that part. Absolutely. And medicine is always a last resort when it comes to children. The most common things are you limit fluids right before bedtime. Some parents, their child doesn't drink anything after five o'clock. Then you have them go to the bathroom immediately when you're starting kind of getting ready for bed and then right before they usually fall asleep. You kind of nudge them, get them in there. Those are kind of the first line of treatment. And what can your doctor do to help? I'm sorry. So then what can your doctor do to help if those things aren't working? If that's not working, they're going to do a careful exam. They're going to test the urine, make sure there's no infection, make sure there's no diabetes. But they're also going to recommend maybe a bed wetting alarm system. That works for many, many motivated kids especially if they're nine years old or ten. A little detection of any kind of moisture which happens right before they would normally start peeing and that puts an alarm out and the child wakes up and goes to the bathroom. That really helps a lot of kids. Hey, you know the other thing we should talk real quick because we're almost out of time here is that there's a real emotional process here that happens with kids who wet their bed. They feel horrible about it. How can parents help them? Be supportive. Do not make them feel guilty. They can help with clean up if there is a bed wetting but do not make them feel like this is their fault. Just tell them you're going to grow out of it and everything will be fine and we can use some medications at a last resort, go back to the doctor. They'll give them something even if it's just for sleepovers. Alright, very good. Dr. Mary Ann Loferman, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate it.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4," 4

UqVI3Y6m4Sc,"Nobody likes to talk about it, but it's a lot more common than you might think. At the age of four, 25% are still waiting their bed. At the age of six, 15%. And at the age of 18 plus, between 1 to 2% are still suffering from bedwetting. In the States, it's estimated that there are between five to seven million children and teenagers that are still suffering from bedwetting. Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi, have helped more than 30,000 children in Israel over the past three decades. Sagi says parents often make mistakes. For example, a lot of parents wake up their child during the night. They try to help him. They want to prevent the bedwetting. But by doing that, they're taking all the responsibility from the child's side to their side. They limit the child's liquids, which is not so recommended as well. They punish him sometimes. They compare him to other siblings. Now they're offering their therapy program online. The kit comes with a state-of-the-art sensor and a plastic sheet. Parents input data on how often the children have accidents, and a virtual therapist responds. Both kids and parents like the interactivity, and the price is $250, as opposed to thousands for a live therapist. In Israel, much of it is covered by insurance. So what the child gets is a real therapist speaking to him, asking him questions. He will answer by clicking the right answer with the mouse on the screen. And then he'll get the right feedback. So we managed to create a virtual therapist that is doing exactly what we've been doing in the traditional program. Sagi says early results show the online program works just as well. And he can send it all over the world, even to Arab countries like Dubai via Europe. He says he hopes to reach hundreds of thousands of children all over the world.

The video does refer to areas of uncertainty. While it provides some statistics and information about bedwetting, it also mentions that the online therapy program is new and has not been extensively tested. The early results are promising, but it is unclear how effective the program will be in the long term or for a larger number of participants. Additionally, the video does not provide any information about the validity or reliability of the virtual therapist or the sensor and plastic sheet kit."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript describes the problem of bedwetting and the therapy program offered by Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi. It explains how the online program works, with a virtual therapist and a sensor to track the child's progress. However, it does not go into detail about how the therapy itself works, such as the specific techniques or strategies used to help the child overcome bedwetting. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes the benefits of the treatment offered by Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi, which is an online therapy program for bedwetting. The benefits include:

1. The online program allows parents to take a more supportive role instead of taking over the responsibility from the child.
2. The program does not limit the child's liquid intake, which is not recommended in traditional methods.
3. The virtual therapist responds to the data input by parents, providing interactivity and engagement for both the child and the parent.
4. The cost of the online therapy program is significantly lower than that of a live therapist, making it more accessible to families.
5. Early results show that the online program works just as well as the traditional program, and it can be sent to children all over the world."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment. It only talks about the prevalence of bedwetting, the mistakes parents make, and the online therapy program offered by Tal Sagi and his father. There is no mention of any other treatment options or their risks."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It mainly talks about the prevalence of bedwetting, the mistakes parents make, and a new online therapy program. It does not mention any consequences or outcomes of untreated bedwetting."," 4

Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices (the online therapy program) affect the overall quality of life of children suffering from bedwetting. The online program helps children and parents by providing a virtual therapist that guides them through the process, and it is more affordable than traditional therapy. The video also mentions that early results show the online program works just as well as the traditional program. Therefore, the video partially addresses how treatment choices affect overall quality of life."," 4

The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video discusses the traditional therapy program offered by Tal Sagi and his father, Jacob Sagi, which involves waking up the child during the night and limiting the child's liquids. However, the video also introduces a new online therapy program that uses a virtual therapist and a state-of-the-art sensor to help children with bedwetting. The video suggests that the online program works just as well as the traditional program and can be sent all over the world. Therefore, the video presents two possible treatment choices for bedwetting: the traditional therapy program and the new online therapy program."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making by presenting an alternative treatment option for bedwetting, which is the online therapy program. However, it does not provide enough information about the potential benefits and risks of this treatment, nor does it encourage the viewer to discuss the option with their healthcare provider.

lL8KZmVxqxM,"Hi, Dr. Windish from Sparks Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine here, and if I'm moving out of the frame you'll just let me know. Welcome back to our educational series for parents. Today we're going to talk about bed wetting. Please remember that these video blogs don't replace consultations with your physician. If you have concerns, make an appointment with your doctor to be seen. We'll be happy to see you here. Area code 775-359-7111. We're experimenting with a new tripod here at the request of several of our regular viewers, so if we're having some difficulty, bear with us. This is a learning experience for all of us. So bed wetting. Bed wetting up until realistically the age of six is not even an issue. The average age of toilet training success for girls is about three years of age and about three and a half for boys. So prior to three and a half years of age, it's not considered abnormal to not be toilet trained at all. And after three and a half to four years of age, about one out of ten boys and about one out of ten girls is not yet toilet trained. Especially at night. So to have episodes of bed wetting that lasts six, seven years of age is hardly unusual if it's happening to ten percent of the patient population. About ten percent of the patients who experience bed wetting after age six get better each year. The majority of these cases are what we refer to as idiopathic Enuresis. There's no known cause. However, if your child after age six is having bed wetting, it is important to be evaluated by a physician. We want to, among other things, sorry about that. So we want to make sure among other things that there's no evidence of sacrocoxigeal tumors, dysfunction of the genitalia, abnormal genitalia, missing parts, extra parts, parts not in the right place, stuff such as that. That's pretty easily ruled out with an appropriate physical exam. That then leaves us with regular bed wetting. And of course when we're talking about regular bed wetting, we're talking about bed wetting that's persisted for a long time. New onset bed wetting is a completely different disease and completely different list of things to worry about. So if your child has been dry at night and is starting to wet the bed all of a sudden, we want to see that child quickly. And there's a lot of things that can do this including diabetes and it's very dangerous. So if your child is a new onset bed wetter, we want to see you right away. Don't waste time. Please come in and see us. But for the chronic bed wetter who really has never been dry for any length of time, what is the most common cause? Well the most common cause realistically is altered sleep. Most of these children are sleeping so deeply they don't recognize the signals from their bladder to get up and use the bathroom. And so they sleep right through it. Many of these kids don't even realize they've wet the bed until morning. If you use bed wetting alarms for these children, the alarms go off, they'll wake up the entire house, but not the child who's wet the bed because he's so sound asleep. So the real treatment is to reprogram the sleep phase for the child. And we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. So they go to bed at their usual time and mom or dad needs to wake the child up when they go to bed. And the goal is to alter the sleep to prevent that altered deep sleep that's not really a normal sleep phase. And in so doing, we can avoid the sleeping right through the signal and eventually the children will learn to recognize the signals from their bladder to get up. Once they are able to be easy to arouse and wake up, then we can start using bed wetting alarms to further train them and finish the training of the process and ending the problem. We do want to make sure that the child doesn't have obstructive sleep apnea. That's another cause that can cause chronic bed wetting and that's something that needs to be treated usually through a pulmonary sleep center. A little more difficult to take care of. Fortunately that one's not quite as common as the altered sleep sensations. People ask me regularly, what about medicines for my child? The reality is there is no medicine to cure idiopathic Enuresis of childhood. It takes time. There are some medicines that will help with the problem including a nose spray called DDAVP and an antidepressant called imipramine. However remember if we put your child on these medicines, they stop the brain's ability to learn how to deal with the sensation of a full bladder. Consequently they are a temporary bandaid. When we take the child off the medicine, they regress back to where they were when we started the medicine. So all it does is delay the time necessary to achieve dry nights. So what is the role of medicine? Well the role of medicine is for summer camp, for sleepovers, to be able to allow your child to do normal childhood things but on a day to day basis they are a bandaid and they do not solve the problem. The child must have his or her sleep retrained and we do that by waking them up in the middle of the night. Remember again we are talking about long standing never been dry children. Children who have had dry nights for months to years who suddenly start wetting the bed we want to see them right away. That's something very dangerous and potentially very dangerous and needs to be evaluated quickly. I hope this has helped to shed some light on a very common, very complicated situation. Remember that again 1 out of 10 children have this problem after age 6 and about 80% are dry by 9 years of age but that means of those children who have bed wetting 20% are having problems after 9 years or 10 years of age. So if your child is one of those children although it's a very frustrating situation the good news is you're in very good company. It's not the end of the world and most of these children, almost all of these children go on to achieve dryness at night. We just need to be patient, make sure there's no long term emotional scars when we're done. This is Dr. Windisch, if we can be of assistance please give us a call at our office, area code 775-359-7111. We'll see you next time.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,2,2,2,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, but there are some parts that could be more explicit. The video aims to educate parents about bed wetting, its causes, and possible treatments. However, the video could have been more concise and focused, especially in the beginning, where the introduction and technical issues take up some time. Additionally, the video could have provided more information on when to seek medical help for bed wetting, as it only briefly mentions this towards the end. Overall, the video is informative and helpful, but could be improved in terms of clarity and organization."," 4

Explanation: The video provides useful information about bed wetting, its causes, and possible treatments. However, it could be improved by providing more visual aids, such as graphs or images, to help explain the concepts. Additionally, the speaker occasionally repeats himself, which could be edited out for a smoother viewing experience. Overall, the video achieves its aim of educating parents about bed wetting, but there is room for improvement."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant to the topic of bed wetting in children, as it provides information on the causes, types, and treatments of the condition. However, it is not a comprehensive or authoritative source of information, as it is an educational video for parents and not a medical journal or textbook. Additionally, the video has some technical issues and is not very polished in terms of production quality. Therefore, the video is partially relevant, but not entirely reliable or professional."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting, its causes, and treatments. However, it does not explicitly mention the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author, Dr. Windish, is a medical expert, but the video does not cite any specific studies or references to support the claims made. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear about the sources of information."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear in terms of the information presented, but it is not entirely up to date with the current medical knowledge. For example, the video mentions that there is no medicine to cure idiopathic Enuresis of childhood, which is true, but it does not mention that there are now more effective treatments available, such as desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) nasal spray and behavioral therapy. Additionally, the video does not address the possibility of psychological factors contributing to bed wetting, which is another aspect of the topic that is relevant. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially' clear."," 4

Explanation: The video is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it provides information about bed wetting, its causes, and treatments. However, it does not mention other possible causes of bed wetting, such as urinary tract infections or constipation, which could be considered incomplete. Additionally, the video prominently displays the doctor's contact information and encourages viewers to call for appointments, which could be seen as a bias towards the doctor's practice."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting, its causes, and treatments. However, it does not provide details of additional sources of support and information. The video does mention that the viewer should consult with their physician if they have concerns, but it does not provide any specific resources or organizations that could offer further support or information."," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects of bed wetting. For example, the cause of idiopathic Enuresis is unknown, the exact prevalence of bed wetting in the general population is not clear, and the long-term outcomes for children with chronic bed wetting are not certain. The video also mentions that some conditions, such as sacrocoxigeal tumors and obstructive sleep apnea, can cause bed wetting, but these are not the most common causes. The video does not provide definitive answers to all questions related to bed wetting, but it does offer some guidance and suggestions for parents and caregivers."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting and its causes, but it does not describe how each treatment works in detail. It mentions altering sleep phase, using bed wetting alarms, and medication as possible treatments, but does not explain how they work or provide any evidence for their effectiveness. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting and its causes, but it does not describe the benefits of each treatment. It mentions that altered sleep is the most common cause and suggests waking the child up in the middle of the night to reprogram their sleep phase.

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment for bed wetting. It only mentions one treatment, which is altering the sleep phase, and briefly discusses the use of medicines without explaining their risks. The video also does not mention other potential causes of bed wetting, such as urinary tract infections or constipation. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning the video partially addresses the question but does not provide a comprehensive answer."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It mainly discusses the causes, types, and treatments for bed wetting. The video does mention that some children may eventually outgrow bed wetting, but it does not provide any specific information on the consequences of untreated bed wetting."," 2

Explanation: The video does partially describe how treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but it is not the main focus of the video. The video mainly discusses the causes and types of bed wetting, and the treatment options mentioned are not explained in detail. The video does not provide a comprehensive overview of how treatment choices can impact the quality of life for children with bed wetting."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor discusses altering the sleep phase, using bed wetting alarms, and treating obstructive sleep apnea as potential solutions. However, the video also emphasizes that medication is not a cure and only serves as a temporary bandaid. The video does not mention other possible treatments, such as behavioral therapy or hypnosis, but it does acknowledge that there are multiple approaches to addressing bed wetting."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some information about bed wetting and its causes, but it does not explicitly encourage the viewer to discuss the issue with their own doctor or consider different treatment options. The video does mention that the viewer should consult with their physician if they have concerns, but this is not the main focus of the video.

T2gYbJatbUg,"This is an example showing how we can use classical conditioning to treat Nocturnal Enuresis. Nocturnal Enuresis is the fancy word for bedwetting. What we do with the, we're going to use the example of a child, a child who is a bedwetter and this is of course a child who is consistently wetting the bed. This is not a two or three-year-old who is wetting the bed. We're starting to be concerned let's say about our six and seven-year-old child who is still wetting the bed every night. It is a maturity thing, it's not a I'm drinking too many liquids before I go to bed or I'm being a lazy kid, it's a brain maturity thing. The brain secretes a hormone that tells us, those of us who don't wet the bed, it tells us at nighttime to decrease urine output. Well these children, their brain is, it's not secreting that message or it's not sending that message to see urine production and output at night. So we want to retrain the body to be able to do that. So what we're going to do is we're going to fit the child with a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm. That alarm you pin it to the child's pajamas up at the top and then it has a little sensor that you pin in their underwear where the monitor will sense moisture and at the first time that it senses moisture a really loud alarm sound goes off and of course that causes the child to wake up. The reason that is the unconditioned stimulus and unconditioned response is no one had to teach this child when this alarm goes off you wake up. It is loud, it causes the child to unconditionally respond to wake up. Well when we pair that with the sensation of a full bladder because when the bladder is full and out comes urine the alarm goes off and of course then the child wakes up. So what we do is we pair this together every time at night when the child is sleeping we have them sleep with this alarm monitor. Every time there's moisture the alarm goes off so the sensation of the full bladder also moisture coming from the bladder being urine output. So we pair this together enough times and research shows that with continual consistent working with the Nocturnal Enuresis monitor that there is a good outcome. We've had a personal experience in our family using it and it took two weeks. We had one of our children who is six years old who consistently wet the bed every night. We called him bed wetters but of course you know now we have pull-ups and goodnight diaper type things for older kids so you don't necessarily hear kids referred to as bed wetters anymore but we did this and it took two weeks of consistent usage to retrain her brain and her bladder and her body to wake up and she no longer suffers from Nocturnal Enuresis. So intervention can it behavior modification intervention is number one before you would want to try something like medications with the child because this classical conditioning example is very very effective.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video aims to demonstrate how classical conditioning can be used to treat Nocturnal Enuresis (bedwetting) in children. The video provides a detailed explanation of the process, including the use of a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm and the steps involved in retraining the child's brain and body. However, the video could have been more concise and focused, as it includes some unnecessary information, such as the age range of the children affected and the types of pull-ups and diapers available for older kids."," 4

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. It provides a clear explanation of Nocturnal Enuresis and how classical conditioning can be used to treat it. The video also shares a personal success story of using the Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to help a child stop bedwetting in two weeks. However, the video could have been more informative by mentioning potential side effects or limitations of the treatment, as well as discussing alternative treatments or when to seek professional help."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a specific treatment for Nocturnal Enuresis using classical conditioning.

The transcript provides a good explanation of Nocturnal Enuresis, the cause, and the treatment using classical conditioning. The transcript also shares a personal experience of using the Nocturnal Enuresis alarm and its effectiveness in treating the condition. However, the transcript could have been more detailed in explaining the exact mechanism of how the alarm and the sensation of a full bladder are paired together to retrain the child's brain and bladder. Additionally, the transcript could have provided more information on the research supporting the effectiveness of this treatment. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. It provides a clear explanation of the condition and the treatment method, which is classical conditioning. The video also shares a personal experience of success with the treatment. However, it could be more balanced by mentioning other treatment options and discussing their pros and cons. Additionally, the video could be more unbiased by acknowledging that not all cases may be successful with this treatment method."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details about the use of a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to treat bedwetting, but it does not mention any additional sources of support or information. The speaker shares their personal experience with the treatment, but does not provide any references to scientific studies or other professional opinions. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, it mentions that bedwetting is not caused by laziness or drinking too much liquid before bed, but rather by a brain maturity issue. This implies that there may be other factors or causes that are not yet fully understood. Second, the video discusses the use of a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to retrain the child's body to wake up when they need to urinate, but it does not provide any specific details on how the alarm works or how it is programmed. This leaves some uncertainty about the exact mechanism of the treatment. Finally, the video claims that research shows that this method is effective, but it does not cite any specific studies or provide any evidence to support this claim. This leaves some uncertainty about the validity of the research and the effectiveness of the treatment. Overall, the video refers to areas of uncertainty in the causes, mechanisms, and evidence for the treatment of bedwetting."," 4

Explanation: The video does a good job of explaining the concept of classical conditioning and how it can be used to treat Nocturnal Enuresis. It describes the process of using an alarm monitor to detect moisture and sound an alarm when the child is wetting the bed. The alarm is paired with the sensation of a full bladder, so that the child learns to associate the alarm with the need to wake up and go to the bathroom. The video also provides a personal example of a successful treatment using this method. However, the video does not go into detail about how the treatment works at a biological level, such as how the brain matures and learns to regulate urine output. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning that the video partially describes how each treatment works."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatment. It explains how the Nocturnal Enuresis alarm works and how it can help retrain the child's brain and bladder to wake up when they need to urinate. The video also shares a personal success story of a child who no longer suffers from bedwetting after using the alarm for two weeks. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the benefits of the treatment, such as long-term success rates, potential side effects, or alternative treatment options."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks of the treatment. It explains the process of using a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to retrain the child's brain and bladder, and shares a personal success story of a six-year-old child who stopped bedwetting after two weeks of consistent usage. However, the video does not mention any potential side effects or complications that may arise from using the alarm, nor does it discuss any alternative treatments or when to seek medical advice."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that bedwetting is a brain maturity issue and that the brain does not send the message to decrease urine output at night. However, it does not explicitly state the consequences of not treating the condition or the long-term effects on the child's life."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains the process of using a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to treat bedwetting and how it can help retrain the child's brain and body to wake up when they need to urinate. The video also mentions that this treatment is effective and can lead to a good outcome in a short period of time. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the treatment choices or discuss the long-term effects of the treatment on the child's quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video presents one specific treatment option, which is using a Nocturnal Enuresis alarm to retrain the child's brain and bladder. However, it also mentions that behavior modification intervention is number one before trying medications, implying that there may be other treatment options available."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as it explains a treatment option for Nocturnal Enuresis using classical conditioning. However, it does not provide any information about the potential risks or benefits of the treatment, nor does it discuss any alternative treatment options. This makes it difficult for a patient or their family to make an informed decision about whether to pursue this treatment. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'",set(),55

Hi, I'm Lynn Friedman. I'm a nurse practitioner at Lurie Children's in the Division of Urology. I love working with kids. I love how excited they get. They're also sometimes a little bit of a puzzle because they can't tell you in the same way as an adult exactly what they're feeling and what's been happening. High quality care, first of all, starts with listening to the family because they're with the kid every day, and so when a parent really just feels, you know, something's just not right, they're often correct and we just have to sort of tease out what that means. So that's often, I think, at the foundation of my sort of philosophy behind the visits that I do. Being a nurse practitioner, we're able to provide excellent care. We have been trained in the specialty that we're all seeing patients in, and overall providing high quality care is the mission of Lurie Children's, and I think everyone should feel comfortable having nurse practitioners serve that role.",4,4,4,2,4,5,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,4," 4

YbcvHnu520o,"Bedwetting in children What is bedwetting? Bedwetting, also known as Nocturnal Enuresis or incontinence, is an uncontrollable leakage of urine in discrete amounts while asleep. Nearly half of parents do not seek help, many believing that their child will eventually outgrow the problem. How common is bedwetting? Bedwetting is very common. It decreases with age and has remarkably similar prevalence rates across the world. Up to 16% of children aged at five years frequently wet their beds. The condition, however, is more common in boys than girls. After allergic disorders, bedwetting is the most common chronic childhood condition. Impact Children with this condition tend to feel a sense of shame, often isolating themselves and avoiding social situations. Children may suffer from feelings of low self-esteem at an age when image is extremely important for optimal personal development. In youngsters aged 8 to 18 years, bedwetting was seen as the third most traumatic event after divorce and parental fighting. Bedwetting can also have a negative effect on a child's school performance. Causes The causes of bedwetting are not fully understood. Mistakenly, 82% of parents believe that deep sleep or laziness are the major causes of their child's bedwetting. Bedwetting is best considered as a symptom that may result from a combination of three different predisposing factors. 1. Sleep arousal difficulties A reduced ability to wake to noise or to bladder contraction. 2. Nocturnal polyuria The production of an abnormally large volume of urine during sleep. 3. Bladder dysfunction Most commonly either a small bladder capacity or overactive bladder. There is often a strong family history of bedwetting with nearly two-thirds of children who wet the bed having one or two parents with a history of the condition. Treatment It is advised that parents of children who wet the bed consult their doctor as early as possible to discuss possible causes and treatment to reduce the impact of bedwetting.",4,4,5,4,4,4,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,3," 4

qgiGiTDhcLI,"How do you know when you want to ejaculate? While premature ejaculation is very fast, ejaculation before you want it, delayed ejaculation is the opposite, where you can't ejaculate when you want it. And it's defined by going on for quite a long time with your sexual activity, and you may or may not even reach orgasm. It's a lot less common than premature ejaculation, but it's very distressing. And we usually see it in men that are older, or men who have had some sort of neurological injury. It is much more difficult to manage than premature or rapid ejaculation, and you usually need to see some sort of sexual therapist. You should see a physician just to be sure there's nothing else going on that may cause that. Men can also have sexual disinterest. It's not just a problem with women. And that means that they don't have the sexual drive, they don't see the world in a sexual way anymore, and it's quite distressing for them because they think as men this is what they should have. And so what we can do about that is assess why that's going on. It's very important to see a physician to be sure there's nothing physiological going on. In other words, what are your testosterone levels? Do you have thyroid problems? Do you have depression? A very common reason for low sexual drive is depression. Is there some reversible thing that a physician can find to assist you with that? But really, there's a sort of a biological component to it, and there's a motivational component to it. So the motivational part needs to be looked at too. Are you in a relationship that you enjoy? Are you attracted to your partner? Are you working too much, and you just don't have any energy for this? So it's a very complicated thing to assess, and you need to see somebody that's capable of looking at both the medical end of it and the psychological end of it.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,2,2,2,2,3,4,3," 4

xLBLQBDNi1g,"I understand. A young man is asking, I can't ejaculate. Help. Delayed ejaculation is a condition in which it takes a period longer than 30 minutes of sexual stimulation for a man to reach sexual climax and ejaculation. Some men with delayed ejaculation are unable to ejaculate at all. In this case we call it inhibited ejaculation or anejaculation. Delayed ejaculation can be temporary or a lifelong problem. It is normal for men to have delayed ejaculation from time to time, but it's only a problem if it's ongoing or causes stress for you or your partner. Delayed orgasm is divided into types based on the symptoms. We have the lifelong versus the acquired. So with the lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time a male reaches sexual maturity, while the acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning. We have also the generalized versus situational. The generalized delayed ejaculation happens with all sex partners at all kinds of situations, while situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances. So what are the causes of delayed ejaculation? It can result from certain chronic health conditions, surgeries and medications, or it may be caused by substance abuse or a mental health concern. Examples of mental health problems could be depression, anxiety or stress. In many cases delayed ejaculation is due to a combination of physical and psychological concerns. There is also the retrograde ejaculation, which is a condition in which the semen goes backwards into the bladder rather than out of the penis. If you have relationship problems or bad communication with your partner, you might be having delayed ejaculation as well. So when to see a doctor? You should see a doctor if delayed ejaculation is a problem for you or your partner. Or if you have a health problem or you take medications that could be affecting your performance. Now, what to expect from the doctor at the doctor's office is two sets of things, mainly a set of questions and then physical examination and some blood tests. So you should be ready to answer your doctor's questions and it will help the doctor reach a proper diagnosis if you are ready with the answers. The treatment of delayed ejaculation depends on the underlying cause. So we might recommend taking medications or making changes in the medications that you are currently taking. There is also the psychological counseling or addressing the alcohol abuse or any other illegal drug abuse. An extra problem that might arise here is the inability to conceive. So if this is the case in your relationship, there are medical treatments that can assist with getting pregnant. Talk to your doctor about it. It is important to reassure your sexual partner that the relationship is not under stress because of this problem. Your partner might think that your inability to reach climax is a sign of diminished sexual interest in her. Communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your condition. Treatment is often more successful if the couples work together as a team. You may even want to see a psychological counselor together. This can help you address concerns that you both may be having to improve your relationship. All the best.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

zyYVK5orA7E,"Someone wrote to me and asked, Delayed ejaculation? Why? To which I'd like to reply, with 100 reasons, ejaculation of all kinds is intentionally or unintentionally delayed. Tell me in the comments which ones you relate to most. Intentionally, someone would delay ejaculation to lengthen the time you're playing with yourself and or others, because you're having fun. If you're not having fun, delaying can give you a chance to improve. It's a good workout to keep the sexual activity going before resolution, so you may delay as a form of exercise for yourself and your partners. You don't get a come bath until you've done 30 laps around the gym. Laps, laps, laps. It builds stamina, endurance, character. Delaying ejaculation builds anticipation. You may delay to prolong the excitement of your own orgasm, or to tease a partner with it. Am I going to cum? Delaying helps emphasize the experience. You're not rushing to some outcome. It also facilitates serial orgasms. If you separate orgasm from ejaculating semen, you can orgasm, orgasm, orgasm, then orgasm and ejaculate. Ejaculating typically means that there's a refractory period to go through before you can cum again, so if they're detached, not one, not two, not three, but four. This applies to partner's orgasms too. By delaying, your partner can have more liberty to cum again and again and again. Delaying ejaculation can mean keeping an erection longer, but not everyone wants, so another reason for delayed ejaculation is lack of control. It happens because of the physiology and or psychology. Your body is worrying, not wanting to bond, or get an STI, or impregnate someone. New sensations throw off the usual cycle of arousal. You're accustomed to masturbation, or porn, or no condom, and it's different, so the body has a different response. Drugs, alcohol, dehydration, and being tired can also delay ejaculation. So can performance anxiety. Edging is practicing control. It's the sexual act of taking yourself to the edge, then stopping, then starting again, then stopping before orgasm. This form of delaying ejaculation helps people become more self-aware, and or aware of what's going on for others while they're holding off. So delaying ejaculation can be like choreographing the timeline and level of excitement that you want. It increases confidence to know when you won't or will cum, and for those who risk pregnancy, edging to delay ejaculation really keys you in on withdrawal, pulling out. But again, not all delayed ejaculation is intentional. Depression can cause unwanted delay, anxiety, stress. Medications that treat these and other conditions can delay orgasm. Antidepressants, high blood pressure meds, diuretics, antipsychotic meds, anti-seizure meds. Whatever the reason delayed ejaculation occurs, there are benefits to working with it. Go with the slow. That time allows you to figure out what you really like, what feels good to your partner. Mmm, I can take all this time rubbing on you and kissing your whole body, all turned on and energized, because my sleep-inducing ejaculation is way over there. Time to try new techniques, new positions, practice new moves, to play, to connect. One reason delayed ejaculation happens is relationship problems. Poor communication, lack of trust, infidelity. While you're delaying, you may be assessing the situation. Is this someone I want to bond with again? Or for the first time? Other biggies are poor hygiene, resentments, conflicts with money, kids, work, the house, being human. Conflicts with our own bodies. If we get up in our head during sex and masturbation, our bodies can check out too. Maybe the delay is a lack of interest. It's like the sexual equivalent of twiddling your thumbs and then cumming. Delayed ejaculation can also result from worrying, being too interested in what might happen. Maybe even avoiding things after ejaculation. Like you're having sex this one last time before a breakup or a long time apart, and you're delaying it intentionally or unintentionally as long as possible. Mind games. There's definitely a game-playing reason to delay ejaculation. Can you get me to cum? Who can hold off longer? Experimentation. How many times can I edge you before you're going to explode? How much more fluid will there be? How much further will it go? Competition. What's the longest that we can have sex without ejaculating compared to previous efforts or previous partners? Are you delaying to outperform someone else? A sort of rivalry? Your ex went for two hours without blowing it. I made it for two hours and six minutes. Delaying can elicit a sense of accomplishment and mean bragging rights for whatever that accomplishment is. To a degree. Prolonged stroking, penetration, rubbing, licking, etc. can be uncomfortable. There's chafing, aching, fizzers. It doesn't feel good. So this is a reminder that even though there are all these reasons, delayed ejaculation isn't always desirable. I'm certain that for some people who struggle with delay, it's not a choice. They wish they could come faster and more easily. There are many medical reasons that ejaculation is delayed and may not feel like accomplishments. Birth abnormalities, injury to the pelvic nerves that control orgasm, infections like UTIs and prostate infections, prostate surgery, diabetic neuropathy, stroke, heart disease, nerve damage to the spinal cord, hypothyroidism, low testosterone, hypogonadism. Retrograde ejaculation is when the person ejaculates but it goes into the body rather than out. So the actual expelling of fluid is delayed sometimes until they urinate. If you're playing with someone else, one way to cope with an unwanted delay is to match your physiological response to slow everyone down. Being able to match another person's level of arousal is a reason in and of itself to delay. You're pacing yourself so that you can sync up. Physically and emotionally, sexual abuse can cause delayed orgasm. Abuse from individuals but also from religion, culture, government. Somatization is a defense mechanism wherein the body expresses physical symptoms for psychological distress. In this case, the symptom of delayed ejaculation to communicate, I'm not ready, insecurity, lack of trust, tain. Ejaculation can hurt for some people so they may hold off as long as possible or avoid it altogether. It may also be that something causes the pain like a dick bending in the wrong direction, not enough lubrication, or you're not turned on, period. Delayed ejaculation might just be the body trying to regroup or get aroused. If a person has recently ejaculated, subsequent efforts tend to take longer. And inversely, if someone hasn't ejaculated recently, or at least not in the manner that they're attempting, things might be slow to acclimate, adjust, work out the kinks. I could come right away if I used this vibrator on here like this, but I'd rather try it with your hands up in there. Even though delayed ejaculation is pathologized, treated mostly as a dysfunction or a disorder, studying it as a variation of sexual expression can be insightful. It's Despacito! Slow, sensual lovemaking. It's a way to add variety, to mark a special occasion, to follow along with a scene at a play party or in a porn. You can time ejaculation with a song or the winning touchdown. Play out a sexual fantasy! The reason for the delay could be as simple as it doesn't feel good here, here, here, or it feels so much better to delay gratification. Try it out. Delay ejaculation for your own curiosity. Stay curious. Can you not see my crotch? The laps like, ha ha ha, laps.",4,3,4,2,4,2,4,5,2,4,2,4,4,4,2," 4

PQqiFt8W7tc,"Hello, my name is Dr. Neil Baum. I'm a urologist in New Orleans, Louisiana, and I would like to take a few moments to talk with you about delayed or retarded ejaculation. In this five minute video, I will define the problem, tell you what causes it, and also discuss with you some of the treatment options for this common condition that affects millions of American men. The definition of retarded or delayed ejaculation is the condition when men find it difficult or even impossible to ejaculate and experience an orgasm during sexual encounters. Millions of American men suffer from this condition, and it's much more common as men age, and the number who suffer from retarded or delayed ejaculation is only going to increase with the aging of the baby boomers. Let's look at the causes of delayed or retarded ejaculation. Anything that disrupts the nervous system and the path to the penis or the testicles, such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, surgery in the male pelvis, diabetes mellitus, or alcoholism can cause delayed ejaculation. There are a large number of drugs that are associated with delayed ejaculation or retarded ejaculation, including medications for treating high blood pressure, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, and even some drugs used to treat the enlarged prostate gland. However, one of the most common causes of delayed ejaculation is aging with a decreased sensation to the penis. The diagnosis of delayed ejaculation or retarded ejaculation is usually made from a sexual history. Also the doctor may inquire about the use of fantasizing during sexual intimacy and will ask questions about the masturbation patterns or frequency of masturbation. Finally, let's look at the treatment options for delayed ejaculation. At the present time, there is no FDA drug that is approved for treating delayed ejaculation. There are behavioral techniques that are used, such as temporarily suspending the use of masturbation and limiting orgasm to sexual encounters. Also which is often helpful is to use increased sexual stimulation, such as can occur with a vibrator or with the couple watching erotic videos. However, treatment is usually successful for this common condition. In summary, delayed ejaculation is a common problem affecting millions of American men. It is usually related to aging or previous surgery within the pelvis. Behavior modification or increasing genital stimulation will significantly help resolve the problem. I hope you have found this video helpful and useful. If you have additional questions, I recommend you go to my website, www.neilbaum.com. Thank you.",5,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,3," 5

FXXLpFETLY8,"What's up everybody? Welcome to The Single Guy FAQ. The question I have today is how do I cure my delayed ejaculation? This is basically like you're having trouble coming during sex, you're having trouble ejaculating. And I know that when you go out sometimes you're doing, you know, you drink a little too much, doing drugs or whatever it is. And sometimes that can make it hard. And trust me, I know, I've been there. Sometimes you drink a little too much and things just aren't happening. I'm talking about when this happens when you're not on any drugs, you're dead sober and you're still having trouble coming. Basically what you need to do is you just need to not jerk off for two weeks. Don't do anything, try not to think about having sex. Do it for two weeks and see if that cures the problem. It should cure the problem instantly, you should be fine after that. You basically just need to give your mind and dick a break. So when you're having sex with a woman, you know, vaginas can be tight but they're not going to be anywhere near as tight as you can grip with your hand. And basically your grip is going to be stronger than anything that she can do. And if you're jerking off a lot, like if you're masturbating a lot during the week, I'm talking like, I don't know, three or four times, but maybe even less can have an effect on it if you're not getting laid at all. You basically just want to give yourself a break because you're desensitizing your penis to what a vagina actually feels like, which it does feel better, but because it's just used as such vigorous and aggressive stimulation, that's going to make it more difficult for you to ejaculate when you're with an actual person. So I would recommend just taking a break and the best way to do it is, you know, not jerking off is pretty fucking hard if you've been doing it your whole life. I know the longest I ever did was about three months. I don't think you need to go that long, I think that was a little bit crazy. But just stop for about two weeks and that should be long enough to let your body kind of correct itself, go back to the way it was, and then you should be coming just fine. But yeah, that's about all I have to say. I'm not going to discuss too much about pornography and that sort of stuff, but I think that the way you masturbate can help you out a little bit if you're just trying to bust that nook as quickly as possible and you're just holding it as tightly as possible and going very rigorous about it. I think that can have some detrimental effects, maybe trying to play around with your mind a little bit and see how things go. Because everybody's body is different, everybody's mind is different, and so there's not going to be one solution for everyone. I think in a different video I'll discuss the nofap and pornography use. Some people say it's really bad for you, other people say it's fine and people are overreacting. I think there's merit to both sides, but again, it depends on the person. Anyway, that's all I have to say about the subject. If you're a person who's suffering from delayed ejaculation, don't jerk off for two weeks, you should be fine. And yeah, that's it. If you have any more questions about any of these types of problems, not just sex, I do mostly about going out, being single as a guy, how to get women, that sort of stuff at bars and things like that, I'm your guy. So just leave me a comment in the section below. Let me know if there's any way I can improve this, and good luck out there.",2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1," 2

Do you all know a woman will experience close to 2,000 oragams throughout her lifetime, while the average man has over 4,000? But that is not the case for our next guest. At 18 he discovered he couldn't achieve orgasm. Now he's 36 and says he'd had less than 20 orgasms ever with a partner. Ben joins us now via Skype. Along with OBGYN, Dr. Millie Behera in our studio. Ben, thanks for being so open and honest about this. I wanna ask you, the first time you knew something was wrong. It started when I was 18 when I first had sex and that's how it was and that's how it carried on for the rest of my life. So I'm kind of resigned to the fact that that's how it is. Ben, thank you for your bravery in sharing your story and we appreciate your speaking with us. I guess just so we can understand a little better, are you able to achieve orgasm when you self pleasure and just not with a partner? It's easier on my own, but it's universally difficult. I think it's fairly common with most people that it is easier on their own. And it's just that for me it's hard to start with and it just gets even harder when I'm with a partner. Ben, you've seen a urologist and you've been checked out. I mean, there's no anatomic physiologic reason why you should be having this problem, correct? Yeah, that's correct. And that gives me a lot of confidence. You know, I've tried everything. I've tried every test going, I've tried hypnotherapy, I've tried working with a coach, I've tried all sorts of kind of men's groups. I've tried working with a sex coach itself, there's nothing wrong with me. And that's kinda led me to believe that this is something that mentally exists. Something that I've held on for whatever reason to from the age of 18. I really think that's a great point, Ben. Is it's nice to know that you've found that, it's reassuring that there's no underlying cause that leads to you know, knowing that there may be an issue with the parts or the function of everything together. I know that you're thinking about future fertility options as well and have had questions about that. But that is also a good sign that you may have good future fertility options and be able to explore that if and when the time is right. But let me comment really quickly, Ben. Because the reason I feel for you so much is because women may not realize how much pressure there is on a man. Because men are supposed to always perform and always succeed. And the assumption is that something is wrong with you if you can't reach orgasm. Or a woman might take it very personally. Most men have a powerful camera on their smart phone. But now a company is offering one for their (spring bounces). What? We have the real deal. Then. Our next guest at 18 discovered he couldn't achieve orgasm. This has destroyed most of your relationships. Towards the stage now where I'm thankful for this in my life. Plus. What if I told you combining the flu vaccine with a surprising medication could treat cancer? 90% reduction on the spread of the disease. All new.

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video seems to be about a man who has difficulty achieving orgasm and his struggle with it. However, the video also includes unrelated topics, such as a company offering a camera for their spring bounces and a medication that could treat cancer. These topics make the video's aims less clear and more confusing."," 2

Explanation: The video does not achieve its aims. The video starts with a discussion about the number of orgasms a person can have in their lifetime, but then shifts to a story about a man who cannot achieve orgasm with a partner. The video does not provide any helpful information or advice for people who may be experiencing similar issues. Instead, it jumps between unrelated topics and does not provide a clear message or solution. Additionally, the video contains inappropriate content that is not suitable for all viewers."," 2

MDQ_V5XcGV8,"Welcome to another Porn Free FAQ. In this one we're tackling the question of, will quitting porn cure my erectile dysfunction and or delayed ejaculation? Well, I've kind of already answered this in some of my other videos recently, but I figured I'd just key in right on this for the guys specifically searching for it. Yes, in most cases it absolutely will because if you've been a heavy porn user and masturbator and stuff like that for a long time, pretty much what you've done is you've trained your brain to think that sex means mouse, keyboard, and hand lotion, okay? Or whatever the heck it is that you use. Looking at a computer screen, it's like it's thinking, your brain has been taught to think that that's what sex is. This image on the screen, that's how you get off. That's what your reproductive process is. If that's what happens, then once you have a real sexual encounter, your brain's like, what's this weird stuff? What's this person here? This isn't sex. It doesn't turn on your equipment. It doesn't let it work properly. If you go through the process of quitting porn, you reboot and you spend a significant amount of time away from porn, well, guess what happens? Your brain heals. It goes back to its natural state, which is the capability to have regular sex. There are tons and tons of rebooting accounts that exist that talk about this kind of success. Just go check out yourbrainonporn.com or nofap.com and they've got plenty of evidence there. Anecdotal, sure, but it works. If you're a young guy who's got this issue, chances are it's porn-induced, and so quitting porn will fix it. If you're an older guy who's got this issue, maybe there's other things involved, maybe your health and that sort of thing. Obviously psychology can play a big part in all of this. Is it a complete 100% cure-all? Not necessarily, but it's a really good chance that it's going to fix your issue. Give it a shot and I think that it could absolutely work for you. Sometimes you may not need to give it a bit of time. I've heard of it taking up to a year or more to heal, but for some cases it's literally just a few months or even a few weeks sometimes is enough to fix it up. Go down the process. I don't know if I gave you any harder answers than that, but all I know is that I've seen it work repeatedly for a lot of guys, and you can probably find a lot of accounts even here on YouTube talking about it. Yes, it'll cure it. Just do the work. Quit the porn. Live a better life. All right, stay sharp. See you in the next one. If you're ready to kick your porn habit and start thriving in real life rather than living in a fantasy, then check out my free reboot regimen guide by clicking the link in the description. In it, I'll teach you the system of simple lifestyle and habit shifts that I've used to help thousands of guys quit porn and transform their lives.

1tZpKp2Yqs0,"Common to all stages of the human sexual response is an inhibitory influence of serotonin. It is therefore not surprising that drugs that increase synaptic serotonin, such as SSRIs and other antidepressants, can cause sexual dysfunction. Presumably, serotonin has a negative influence on sexual function because it can reduce dopamine neurotransmission by stimulating 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Thus, when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor increases synaptic serotonin, the serotonin can bind to 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors on GABA interneurons. This stimulates GABA release, which in turn inhibits dopamine release. Likewise, direct binding of serotonin at 5-HT2A receptors on dopamine neurons also inhibits dopamine release. This proposed mechanism by which serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause sexual dysfunction is supported by the fact that 5-HT2A antagonists do not induce sexual dysfunction. Of course, other mechanisms may also be involved. For example, some antidepressants have anticholinergic effects, some block alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, and paroxetine inhibits the synthesis of nitric oxide.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are clear, as it explains the relationship between serotonin, dopamine, and sexual function, and how certain drugs can affect sexual function by altering serotonin levels.

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses the relationship between serotonin, dopamine, and sexual function, which is a topic of interest for medical professionals and patients. However, it is not a complete explanation of the topic, as it only focuses on one possible mechanism of action for antidepressants causing sexual dysfunction. Additionally, the video does not provide any visual aids or examples to help clarify the concepts being discussed. Therefore, the score is 4, which indicates that the video is partially relevant."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication, as it cites specific receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C) and neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and GABA) that are involved in the proposed mechanism of sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants. However, it does not explicitly mention the author's sources, so it is not a perfect 5."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides clear and accurate information about the role of serotonin in the human sexual response and how it can be affected by antidepressants. The proposed mechanism for how serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause sexual dysfunction is well-explained and supported by evidence.

It is, yeah. So welcome. Thank you. Why did you decide to do the blog and the Instagram? Because this is something very personal, isn't it? Which most men don't talk about, which we'll discuss in a moment. Most men don't talk about it. Most men have never heard of this. So what is this condition? It's called delayed ejaculation. In terms of a condition, it's just something I've always had. The first time I ever had sex, it just didn't happen. So does it happen eventually? Does it happen half an hour later? It just doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. But what's the difference between delayed and not happening? Well, I think it's the wrong terminology. It shouldn't be called delayed. There are other names for it. Non-orgasm or non-orgasm. Yeah. I mean, it does happen sometimes. So how old when that first happened to you? I was 18. 18. Did you seek medical advice? Did you talk to anybody about it at the time? No, I didn't have any preconceptions. I had sex and it didn't happen. So when did you think this is actually going to be a problem for me? At the age of 30, I started to think, through my 20s, it had been a bit of a laugh. The lads would call it a bit of a gift. You can go on forever. Staying power. Staying power, exactly. Yeah. But at the age of 30, I started to think, well, family, and this had affected a few relationships negatively. It was something I didn't want in my life anymore. And it was somebody you met who was a life coach, psychologist, that you decided to talk to her that made you think, I need to really be open about this. Totally. She was helping my flatmate who had an injury through rugby. And I was like, well, if you're helping him with an injury, how about this? Can I talk to you about this? And she was like, yeah, of course. Well, we can help you with that. So we started having the conversation and she completely rewired my whole mind. And I think initially I always thought this was something physically that was existing and it was just the way it was. And then she taught me that actually this is probably something that arrived mentally. OK. Well, let's bring the doctor in at this stage. Doctor, why is it not happening for Ben? So your delayed ejaculation, delayed orgasm, and orgasm is the medical term for it, essentially is the failure to reach orgasm or the difficulty to reach orgasm despite sufficient sexual stimulation. It's very common for men and women to have a temporary difficulty achieving orgasm, for example, if you're stressed, if you're anxious, if you're drunk. That's not unusual. What is unusual is for it to be a persistent problem. We think it affects far more women than men. We think it affects about 5% of women. It's much rarer in men, even rarer in young men. And it can have a massively significant impact on your mental well-being. Quite understandable. Well, that's really where it comes back to you, Ben. You're not a professor. Ben, that's your Instagram name, the naked professor. It did affect you mentally. And that's why you decided to do the Instagram. What reaction have you had? And why do you do it naked? Just to get attention? Primarily. I mean, my message is about, well, the whole mental aspect has been very much around, I don't think I was very vulnerable. I think I was inauthentic and I was being, sort of following society. I was just being my way. And I don't think that was working for me. And I think that was part of the issue, if I'm honest. Making you anxious. Part of the anxiety, yeah. And exactly. And so I wanted to do something. I was, over the course of learning about what was going on here, I was growing mentally and started to embrace vulnerability, started to embrace freedom and trying to represent who I really was. So I started writing about this stuff, but I knew I needed a story, a tagline, a USP that might sort of get people's attention to see what I was writing about. Because if there's so much noise now, if you're putting this stuff on the internet, who's actually going to see it unless there's a catch? And the images represent the vulnerability that I'm trying to embrace, the freedom. Talking about people seeing you through the noise, what about people seeing you in the nude? Yeah. And how do you get away with that? Or what sort of reaction do you have to that? I'm really lucky. I haven't had any negativity whatsoever, which is great. And if I do, that's fine because people have touched their opinion. But these are very public places. So you're doing this very early in the morning when no one's around. Yeah. We're really careful. We're not here to offend anyone. So it's really early in the morning. But you don't get a tap on the shoulder and say, hello, hello, hello. The police not there. Have you never had any situations like that? It's not illegal to be naked in public. It's illegal to cause offence. So as long as there's no one there, then it's... So you can be naked and if they admire you, it's fine. If you offend people being naked, it's an offence, right? Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, in theory, yeah. That's right. So we're not going to take the risk whether people like it or not. So as long as no one's there, we're really quick in getting the image done. So the message is to raise awareness, obviously, of this condition. Is there something medically can be done for people with this condition? So first I've got to say, I take my hat off to you for talking about this because I think you all have helped so many people already and by doing this. Now, the vast majority of people that have this issue, it is probably nine times out of 10 a psychological problem. There are a small proportion of people who have a medical issue that can be treatable. So if anyone's going through this, first and foremost, go and see your doctor. They will check you out from a medical perspective to see if there's a treatable condition there. For example, you might have to look at your alcohol intake. You might have to look at whether you've got something like diabetes or whether you're on certain medication. Now, if that's not identified, then you need to go down the psychological route. That could be talking therapies. That could be sexual therapy, psychotherapy. And some people do benefit from taking certain medications that may help you. And have you done anything like that? I've done everything, really. I've tried all sorts of different medicines. I've tried urologists. I've tried doctors. I've tried hypnotherapy. I've tried everything. Nothing's worked specifically for that, but it has made me grow as a person. So there's almost an element of me being thankful to it. And I believe this, that everything shows up in your life for a reason because it's changed me as a person. And it's helped me grow into who I am today and led to me in the blog. So you're just living with the condition, dealing with the condition. I am, yeah. I believe that everything's there for a reason. And I also think everything will teach you, will stay with you until it's taught you the lesson it was there to teach you. And I think this has taught me a lesson that's not quite ready yet to... Well, it's very nice to see you, to see your face today. We've seen you on Instagram. And that's Ben, the naked professor. Thank you, Dr. Fenge.",4,4,5,4,4,3,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are clear, as it is about raising awareness of delayed ejaculation and sharing the personal experience of the person who has this condition. The video also aims to show how the condition affects mental well-being and how it can be addressed through various methods. However, the video could have been more concise and focused, as it covers multiple aspects of the topic and sometimes deviates from the main theme."," 4

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. The video aims to raise awareness about delayed ejaculation, a condition that affects many men, and to share the personal story of Ben, who suffers from it. The video also aims to show how Ben has learned to embrace his condition and use it as a platform to talk about mental health and vulnerability. The video does a good job of explaining the condition and its possible causes, both physical and psychological. It also provides some advice for people who might be suffering from the same condition. However, the video could have been more informative if it had included some examples of treatments that have been tried and tested for delayed ejaculation, and if it had provided some statistics or data on how common the condition is. Additionally, the video could have explored more deeply the relationship between the condition and mental health, and how Ben's journey of self-discovery and growth has been influenced by it."," 5

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a medical condition (delayed ejaculation) and its psychological and social impact on the person experiencing it. The video also features a medical expert (Dr. Fenge) who provides information and advice for people with this condition. The video is informative and engaging, and it raises awareness about a topic that may not be well-known or widely discussed."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author, Ben, shares his personal experience with delayed ejaculation and how it affected his life. He also talks to a doctor, Dr. Fenge, who provides medical information about the condition and possible treatments. However, the video does not explicitly mention other sources of information, such as books, articles, or research studies, that might have contributed to the author's understanding of the topic. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript is a conversation between a medical expert and a man who suffers from delayed ejaculation. The medical expert explains the condition, its causes, and possible treatments. The man shares his personal experience and how he decided to create an Instagram account to raise awareness and help others. The transcript is informative and easy to understand, but it could be improved by providing some visual aids or examples to illustrate the concepts discussed."," 3

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The transcript shows a conversation between a medical expert, a psychologist, and a man who suffers from delayed ejaculation. The medical expert provides information about the condition and its possible causes, treatments, and impacts on mental well-being. The man shares his personal experience and how he decided to be open about his condition and use his Instagram account to raise awareness. The psychologist also contributes to the discussion by helping the man rewire his mind. However, the video is not entirely balanced and unbiased because it does not present other perspectives or experiences of people with the same condition, nor does it explore alternative treatments or coping strategies. The video also focuses mainly on the man's Instagram account and his nudity, which may not be relevant to the main topic of the video."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as talking to a life coach, psychologist, or doctor. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that can help people with this condition.

Additionally, the video touches on the impact of the condition on mental well-being and relationships, which can be uncertain and vary from person to person."," 4

The video does describe the condition of delayed ejaculation and how it affects the individual, but it does not provide much detail on the treatments. The doctor briefly mentions that some people may have a treatable medical condition, while others may benefit from psychological therapies or medications. However, the video does not go into depth about the specific treatments or how they work. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

The video partially describes the benefits of each treatment for delayed ejaculation. The doctor explains that the condition is likely a psychological problem for most people and can be treated with talking therapies, sexual therapy, psychotherapy, or medication. However, the video does not provide specific examples of how each treatment has helped people with the condition or any evidence to support the effectiveness of the treatments."," 4

Explanation: The video does describe the risks of the treatment, but it is not very clear or comprehensive. The risks are mentioned in the context of the psychological and medical aspects of the condition, but they are not explicitly discussed or explained. The video also focuses more on the personal story and the impact of the condition on the individual's life, rather than the risks of the treatment options. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

The video does partially describe what would happen if no treatment is used. Ben, the person with the condition, talks about how it affected his relationships and mental well-being, and how he tried various treatments without success. However, the video also includes a lot of other information, such as the doctor's explanation of the condition, the reasons behind it, and the possible treatments. Therefore, the score is not a perfect 5, but rather a 4, as it partially addresses the question."," 4

The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video discusses the condition of delayed ejaculation and how it has affected the individual's mental well-being. The doctor explains that the condition can be a psychological problem or a treatable medical issue. The individual has tried various treatments, but none have specifically addressed the condition. The video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the treatment choices and their impact on quality of life, but it does touch on the topic."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the possible treatment choices for delayed ejaculation.

However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the possible treatment options or discuss the effectiveness of each one."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but not to a great extent. The video features a conversation between a medical expert (Dr. Fenge) and a patient (Ben) who has a condition called delayed ejaculation. They discuss the condition, its possible causes, and treatments. However, the video does not explicitly involve the patient making any decisions or considering different options with the doctor's guidance. The video mainly serves as an informational and educational resource for the audience, rather than a tool for shared decision-making.",set(),67

What I love to do is help people learn how to have passionate lovemaking. I teach people bedroom communication skills. And the third leg of that stool is all important and that's sexual health. Because without your sexual health, it's hard to have sex. So there are a couple of different erectile issues that men struggle with. One is delayed ejaculation. Often delayed ejaculation is a mental issue that's due to either a dopamine issue from porn addiction or a shame, deep shame from family programming, religious programming, cultural programming, something that's happened to them, sexual abuse. They can't ever quite get there. And then there can also be sensation loss, physical issues, sensation loss from things like diabetes or lack of vascularization, which is one of the things that Gaines Wave fixes.

However, the video also seems to be promoting a product called Gaines Wave, which is not clearly explained. The video could be more focused and informative if it either explained what Gaines Wave is and how it helps with the issues mentioned or if it focused solely on providing advice and resources for people struggling with sexual health issues."," 2

Explanation: The video does not achieve its aims because it does not provide any clear instructions or advice on how to improve sexual health or overcome erectile issues. Instead, it mainly focuses on promoting the speaker's credentials and the Gaines Wave product. The video also lacks any visual aids or demonstrations that could help viewers better understand the topic."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses sexual health and erectile issues, which could be important for some medical experts. However, the focus on a specific product (Gaines Wave) and the overall tone of the video make it seem more like a sales pitch than an informative resource. Additionally, the video does not provide any evidence or citations to support its claims, which would be important for a medical expert to evaluate its credibility."," 2

Explanation: The video is not very clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication, other than the author.

The speaker mentions potential mental, physical, and cultural factors, but does not explore them in depth or provide clear guidance on how to address them. Additionally, the speaker promotes a product (Gaines Wave) as a solution, but does not provide evidence or explanation of how it works or why it is effective."," 2

The speaker provides a detailed explanation of the self-insemination process and reassures the audience that it can be effective in achieving pregnancy. However, the video could be improved with more context about the specific situations or conditions that might lead to the need for self-insemination, as well as potential risks or concerns associated with the technique."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript partially achieves its aim of providing information on alternative methods for couples who have difficulty with natural conception.

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased because it presents an alternative method for couples who may have difficulty with natural conception. However, it could be more balanced by discussing other options, such as fertility treatments or seeking medical advice. The video also uses a casual tone and crude language, which may not be appropriate for all audiences."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about an alternative method of conception for couples who may have difficulty with traditional intercourse. However, it does not provide details of additional sources of support and information. It only briefly mentions the turkey baster technique and does not offer any resources or further explanation for those who may be interested in learning more about it."," 2

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in two ways. First, it addresses the uncertainty of couples who feel like they cannot have a baby due to ejaculation issues. Second, it introduces the self-insemination technique, which may not be widely known or accepted by all audiences. The video does not provide any scientific evidence or studies to support the effectiveness of the technique, leaving some room for doubt. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how each treatment works. It explains the self-insemination technique, which involves ejaculating into a cup, using a syringe to inject the sperm into the vagina. However, it does not provide any information about other treatments or alternatives for couples who have difficulty ejaculating inside the vagina."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains that self-insemination can help couples who have difficulty ejaculating inside the vagina during intercourse, and it states that the sperm can be equally as effective in establishing a pregnancy whether they are shot there by the penis or put there with a syringe. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the benefits of different treatments or address potential drawbacks or risks of the self-insemination technique."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment.

jqnBwAb9Cno,"So, I know that if you're looking at this video, you're probably feeling frustrated by either taking a really long time to have an orgasm or for some men, even with a lot of sexual stimulation, you just feel like you can't reach that point of inevitability, you actually can't ejaculate or have an orgasm with a partner. And so I'm here to express some of the reasons it can look that way. I think for many men it may have to do with medication side effects. Commonly, we associate antidepressants in particular the SSRI's with what we call Sexual Induced Dysfunction which typically can look like delayed ejaculation as well as decreased libido. So it's important to realize if this change is in timing with a medication, either increase or starting something new, that absolutely may explain this new symptom and you absolutely want to speak with your doctor to look at whether there are other treatments that would be available or whether they may be able to decrease that medication and add something else so that you're getting symptomatic relief without this unwanted or sort of less than desired side effect. I think for other men, sometimes delayed ejaculation can have to do with masturbation style. That, you know, if you're not ultimately using your hand and maybe preferring to rub up against a mattress or a pillow, that's what we consider idiosyncratic meaning the kind of stimulation that's bringing the orgasm is very difficult for a partner to duplicate. That also can happen when you're using porn and using a lot of physical stimulation, either speed or pressure. So, I often have clients experiment with using their non-dominant hand just to get a sense of more conscious of exactly what kind of stimulation they're using to see whether or not if they're feeling really frustrated and can't make it work with the non-dominant hand that maybe an additional factor. And lastly I want to include that for some men, first morning experiences are often not optimal and they're not fully awake enough and so they may not ejaculate. As well as if you just recently had a sexual experience with ejaculation because of what we call the refractory period, it's sometimes too soon to have another experience where you're going to be be able to be fully erect and ejaculate. Above all, regardless of the reason that you may be having delayed ejaculation, don't get sucked up into the frustration, because that in and of itself will hijack your arousal and the whole experience for you and your partner.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,4," 4

Wp-xvKWt1AQ,"Hi guys, I'm Kerry and I'm part of the counselling team at My Counselling Service Australia. Now for the last few videos we've been having a look at some of the sexual difficulties which might be impacting negatively on your sexual experiences. And today I thought we could have a look at a condition known as delayed or inhibited ejaculation. Now delayed ejaculation is when the man feels all the right emotions and desires and can achieve a nice firm erection but just can't relax enough to finalise into a nice orgasm. So let's have a look at some of the, first of all the thought processes which we might be able to change and then some practical suggestions as well. Okay so firstly let's make sure that we're not stuck in some negative self talk about your sexual experiences and your sexual abilities. So start to be kinder to yourself, make sure that you start to think positively rather than negatively. So think about things which you like about yourself, think about things that you do well when you have sex with your partner or partners. Also guys I know that pornography is very good for arousal and desire but don't become too dependent on this. Start to make and create your own sexual fantasies that turn you on and you don't have to share these with your partner they can be your own private fantasies so they can be anything that turns you on at all. You might like to start writing these fantasies down or even start to just create them mentally for yourself so that you have them there in your mind while you're having sex. Also before penetration make sure you're giving yourself enough time to build up and become very very very highly aroused before you begin penetration. So more in depth foreplay for yourself. And some nice techniques for this would be you might like to try running a vibrator on the tip of your penis. Also there's a piece of skin at the base of your scrotum between the base of your scrotum and the anus that you might like to try and tickle and get your partner to try and tickle as well. I know it sounds strange but this might help you to orgasm and relax enough to orgasm. So you can try a couple of these techniques. Also during penetration you might like to get your partner to close and clamp their legs very tightly so there's a lot of pressure on the penis. If your partner has climax and you still haven't don't keep trying with penetration and become frustrated and let the desire levels fall. After you've pleasured your partner you can start to pleasure yourself in another way. Bring yourself to orgasm through self stimulation or get your partner to stimulate your penis and come that way. And stay relaxed and focused on all your sexual fantasies and don't become too obsessed with having to orgasm through penetration. So I hope some of these suggestions are helpful for you and we'll talk again soon. Be good to yourself and be good to your partners and I hope you have safe and satisfying sex and we'll talk again soon. Bye.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,4,3,2,4,4,4," 4

XNob3rrcTMw,"Hi, I'm Kathy Bartoli from the intimacy dojo.com. I'm Reid Mihalko from meaboutsex.com. We have a video on premature ejaculation. It's really short. Oh my god, I can't believe you said that. Someone Email or messaged us and said that they had the opposite problem. They delayed ejaculation and they're wondering if we had any suggestions or solutions because it's kind of frustrating doesn't get off very often. Should I make a joke about this video being very long and going on forever? I think you are. Do you think it's gonna end? I'm sure people feel that way right now. So what suggestions do you have for someone who has delayed ejaculation? Well first, Jack Assery excluded like I Mean, I know it feels like the end of the world But bringing in some play in humor with the fact that we're human beings And that regardless of if you're you know, you have a vulva or penis When things are taking too long Acknowledge that yeah, because you will only ever get in your head more which is never the solution to achieving orgasm or erection or whatever So Understand that and just tell your partners like hey just so you know, like I want to come But I don't feel like I'm gonna be able or I'm getting in my head about taking this is taking forever Those kind of communication skills are useful one because it's your best shot to kind of quiet down this bad neighborhood up here Where you're gonna get mugged But also your role modeling for your partner took you for them to share what's going on for them Which opens up dialogue and that's just good for relationships the other Piece of advice I would give to people Is start under you won't understand a couple things one Are you on any kind of medication that can maybe that may be affecting your libido or your ability to you know to reach orgasm? That's just useful Two is this a condom thing like you're using condoms, you know, which a lot of people complain Dead in sensation. I think we talked about the premature ejaculation video like use more condoms Don't put baby on yes, but like use a condom to you know alleviate too much sensation in this situation if you're Masturbating a lot if you have a penis You're masturbating a lot without a condom and then you're using condoms for safer sex purposes or a pregnancy and that is Creating a situation where you're not able to ejaculate Then practice masturbating with a condom on as A means of starting to figure out your own body and what it needs For you to be able to reach orgasm in in kind of like a real-life situation I'm having sex with a condom on the other thing I would look at is Different positions that are easier for you to achieve orgasm in and now this we talked about this a lot with you know People with vulvas, you know, if I'm on top and I'm fucking somebody. Oh my god so much easier I'm on the bottom if I'm doggy style, but we don't talk about it for You know our penis owners Where we're having issues with ejaculating. Oh Let me try different positions Maybe Some may be the aha moment whatever that is for me You know fucking somebody doggy style Really useful for me if I want to try to get off for purposes of you know, I'm Usually on my knees or standing and for whatever reason me being standing or on my knees Is a lot it's a lot easier for me to come from that position It has a lot to do with pelvic floor muscles and a bunch of other stuff For other people having somebody on top Is gonna be easier for you because the pressure and the weight on your hips gives you something to hump into and that's gonna be better Exactly for me doggy style. I look down there's an ass and it looks awesome So like figure out to like your erotic pieces, like what are the positions or the situations for you?

So if you can take some time with your partner or yourself where you can actually take Ejaculation orgasm off the table and just enjoy touching each other touching yourself and enjoying the sensation Sometimes it's really hard to just have sex without having the code. Yeah, and there's nothing wrong with telling each other I want to come but I'm not gonna be able to do it fucking or with the blowjob or orally or whatever Can we just lie next to each other and masturbate and finish each other up? That's totally legit and super hot for a lot of people Don't make it you somehow fail.

i_U00apnsvM,"Hi all you guys out there. I'm Dr. Alex Pastaszak and I'm a urologist at the University of Utah specializing in men's health. A lot of men can have issues with ejaculation and orgasm which include either premature or delayed ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is when a man has an orgasm within less than one to three minutes of penetration and delayed ejaculation is when he lasts typically longer than 25 minutes. Either way both of these conditions can be really uncomfortable for men. So I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about treatments for both of these conditions. To take a step back we don't yet completely understand the causes of either premature or delayed ejaculation but there are a number of treatments that can be helpful. For premature ejaculation therapies can include behavioral therapy which can help men learn to suppress their orgasms, topical anesthetics which can decrease penile sensation and delay orgasms. Men can buy these either over-the-counter or with a prescription in some cases and oral treatments which include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or what are commonly called SSRIs which can strongly reduce the urge to orgasm as well as some opiate drugs like tramadol which is a weak narcotic but which can also increase the time it takes men to orgasm. For delayed ejaculation some therapies can include psychosexual therapy to treat sexual inhibitions and medical therapies all of which are still considered experimental but can include oxytocin which is a hormone that can actually speed up orgasm in men, cabergaline which is a drug that can drop prolactin levels and can also potentially speed up how quickly a man can orgasm and a number of other drugs which include drugs like amantadine or bupropion, buspirone, ciproheptadine and yohimbine. I know that these are all mouthful but none of these drugs have really substantial clinical evidence for efficacy but they may all help. Also acupuncture may also be helpful but again has fairly little supporting evidence so while a lot of men can be affected by either premature or delayed ejaculation and while we don't completely understand these conditions there are actually a number of therapies that have shown at least some effectiveness in treating them so if you have premature or delayed ejaculation and would like to discuss it come visit us at the University of Utah and talk with us.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,2,4,5,3," 4

vHiL46OWyMI,"Orgasm disorders are not as common in men as they are in women. Most men are able to reach climax and orgasm without difficulty, but some men have difficulty reaching climax or orgasm. Typically, but not always, this is related to one of two things. First of all, neuropathy or nerve damage. If you have neuropathy or nerve damage and you can't feel right on the genitals, it's going to be more difficult to climax. So men who have neuropathy caused by many different things, like diabetes, alcohol, drugs, head, neck or back injuries, Parkinson's disease or strokes, can cause neuropathy or nerve damage. If you have nerve damage, often it will be difficult to sense things on the penis. And if you can't sense correctly or feel things on the penis, it might be difficult to orgasm. The other main category or culprits when it comes to difficulty reaching orgasm is psychiatric medicines or pain medicines. Any medication that alters sensation could potentially alter your sensations on your genitals and your ability to reach climax. The biggest culprits are pain medicines. If it changes your sensation of pain, it might also change your sensation of pleasure. In addition, many of the psychiatric medicines that are commonly used for depression can also cause difficulty reaching climax. So difficulty reaching climax is typically caused by a neuropathy or nerve damage or medications.

I maybe it would work for you, maybe it won't. I really don't, I'm just gonna tell you what I did and how I fixed the problem I had my whole life. It is true that I could never ever ever ejaculate inside a woman.

The way I did it is like it's very very simple, it's gonna be three easy steps. Well yeah, what can I say? The first step for me is that I just quit porn. Yeah, just quit porn man. You have a problem, do it. Why you gonna say me? Because from my point of view what I realized is that porn reduced my motivation, it creates unrealistic expectations so what you can see there is not what you can do in your bedroom, it's not possible really. Porn puts sex on a pedestal, porn puts women on a pedestal and it makes it something like it lives in your imagination, it's not something that you can actually do. I don't know, just this was the first thing that actually changed my whole fucking life. My second tip stop masturbating for three weeks. Yeah, I suppose I had like a very strange pattern that I masturbated so after stopping that everything just fell into place. I started gaining the will to do stuff, I started gaining motivation, I don't know, I just want to get sex, just go after it after that. And finally my third and final step which is very very simple is just to start having sex after three weeks in case you do have a girlfriend and you actually want to get it off, you know, just masturbate but try to break the pattern, don't do things the way you used to do them. It's what got you there in the first place. Well what else can I say? This is what I had to say actually.

gz0Fkc3XeZY,"What causes a man not to ejaculate during sex? Hi! my name is Martha. I'm a Clinical Sexologist with a Doctorate in Human Sexuality. I'm also a Relationship Coach and you can find me at (eroscoaching.com) that's E.R.O.S. Coaching (dot) com. Regardless of the cause, when a man wants to but cannot ejaculate, this is known as delay ejaculation. It can be physical, it can be psychological. So, let me go more into physical. Physical ""Delay Ejaculation"" can happen, for instance, is his prostate was removed. If he has some kind of problems with his prostate, for instance prostate enlargement and when that happens, that causes physical difficulties with ejaculation, other physical difficulties (can take that) can cause a problem with ejaculation, can be a high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension. So, there might be a physical cause behind difficulties with ejaculation: health problems, surgeries cancer, so on and so forth. Then, that's the psychological component, which is, when they may have anxiety (and) stress around the sexual act itself or maybe around the relationship for instance. If they've had instances of not being able to sustain that erection, not even being able to ejaculate, these things can cause anxiety. Like, Oh my goodness! This is going to happen again, I better not screw up, I better not be a loser, things like that. So, I mean you have negative thoughts, this can also affect the ability to ejaculate and sometimes it can be both, it can be both a component of physical and psychological. Let me explain further, so I know of many men, who masturbate in the same way. Quietly, quickly, secretly and over time this way of masturbating, causes their penis to become desensitized and so when the penis is a less sensitive, they are finding it difficult to ejaculate. Because, they are used to using their hand, the friction, the grip, and when inside the vagina they haven't had as much time and experience being in a vagina. They might have anxiety, but they also might have actual physical sensation of feeling like the grip is not strong enough, so this is not about them, not having a tight vagina, this is actually about the sensation that true of habitual masturbation. So, what happens is that with practice, you can actually learn how to re-sensitized your penis, one of the things is self genital massage, so a lot of people say ""Yeah, why don't I just go and get people giving me massage or hand jobs"" It's actually the consistency of the practice and also when you touch yourself, you know the amount of pressure you're putting on yourself, so we sensitizing your penis it's actually part of it. This our online training program called ""Ready, Get Sex, Go!"" I know on the program it says that it helps men with premature ejaculation, but actually also helps men with delayed ejaculation. What it does is, instead of desensitizing the penis, the intention here is to re-sensitized the penis to make the penis more sensitive through all the practices. They are also in the same program, so the same program actually works on different men with different conditions, but it is the same program. So, yeah! Do check out the program that I'm talking about and also the other links that I'm sharing with you. The program you can find at (eroscoaching.com/RGSG) ""Ready, Get Sex, Go"" program So, yeah we'll check it out and if you have further questions you can drop me an email at (Ask@eroscoaching.com) So, that's where I am taking the questions and making them into videos, so it has to benefit more people.

Rl2JKQKgymI,"The ejaculation problem that most men don't talk about. Hi guys, JE here. We have discussed premature ejaculation problem a couple of times in this channel. But today, let's talk about another issue. And it's the opposite of that. It's delayed ejaculation. Some of you maybe think that if you can last longer, that's great. But those who suffer from things different, it could be mentally and physically exhausting. You can feel depressed or anxious, which makes the condition even worse. It's something that really can affect your sexual life and even affect your relationship. It's some serious stuff. And ejaculation is considered delayed when you have a tough time ejaculating or reaching orgasm during sex, even when you are enjoying it. The condition affects an estimated 8% of guys in the United States, different than premature ejaculation that is usually defined as ejaculating three minutes or less after penetration. There is an amount of time that is established delayed ejaculation. But some experts say you may have it if you can have an orgasm within the first 20 minutes after penetration. There are several things that can cause this condition. The process of ejaculation involves your nerves. And they are the ones that send a signal from your brain to your pelvis muscles, telling them to contract and release the semen. So when your nerves are not communicating properly with your brain, then this process could be delayed. So some of the causes are medical conditions such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis, drugs or medications that interfere with the central nervous system, including antidepressants, for sure. Another cause is the low levels of testosterone in your body. And last but not least, psychological issues like anxiety, depression, performance anxiety, relationship conflict, sexual change or sexual trauma from the past. What are the treatments for this condition? Your first step is to see an neurologist, preferably one who specializes in sexual medicine. The most successful treatment includes both medical intervention and counseling from a sex therapist. That session may include the participation of the couple if you are in a relationship, since this is also that can affect both. If you are suffering from delayed ejaculation, don't feel embarrassed to talk to your doctor. Take the step and put a stop to the suffering. You may find the solution faster than you can imagine if you do this. Thank you so much for watching. Drop a like or a comment if you find this video helpful.

k46r5RLeRXc,"What's up y'all? Welcome to downtown Asheville. I decided to come down here today to film this video where I'm going to talk about how to ejaculate if you can't ejaculate during sex with your girlfriend. So to be very upfront, this is not an issue that I struggle with. I came from the other end of the spectrum, which is having to overcome years of premature ejaculation and to get to the point where I am now, which is being able to have sex for a long time. So today I wanted to talk about a buddy of mine who I was talking with a few weeks ago who has this same issue. He came to me and he said, you know Taylor, like the work you're doing is awesome, but it's all focused on how to not ejaculate. My problem is that I can have sex with my girlfriend and just not ejaculate and she's fucking hot and she's awesome and I want to be able to have that experience with her, but I can't do it. So immediately I was like, oh wow, like let's have a conversation. I'd love to know what's going on for you. So we decided to talk about it and I asked him these questions and I think they might be helpful for you if you're struggling with this issue. So the first question I asked him was how much porn do you watch and to which he answered a fair amount. He watched porn like four or five times a week and my immediate response to that was wow, man, you know, that's probably impacting your ability to ejaculate with your girlfriend. It's certainly impacting your arousal system and the way you're responding to visual stimuli and how you can respond or not respond to the beauty of a real woman right there with you in the moment. You know, if you're watching porn all the time, your brain is flooded with these images of perfectly manicured, well, not even perfectly, like these fake manicured women that it just like fucked up your ability to appreciate what's right in front of you. So the second question I asked him was what are your masturbation habits and to that he responded he masturbates every night before he goes to bed and he also ejaculates every night before he goes to bed too. So this is a guy who's watching porn four to five times a week who is also ejaculating every night before going to bed who can't ejaculate with his girlfriend during sex. So he asked me what should he do and if you're in this situation here's what I would suggest to you because it worked for him. I suggested that he just like stop watching porn altogether. Try it for two weeks to see what would happen. And I also suggested that he stopped masturbating every night before before going to sleep and he was concerned that if he did that he wouldn't be able to sleep because you know it's this nice release, right? So I said why don't you try this cooling breath technique? That's in my semen retention course that's free right now for the next month. So check that out if you want and sure enough like he was able to after about a week and a half of doing this without watching porn or without masturbating and ejaculating every night he was able to ejaculate with his girlfriend in sex. So what he needed was a little counterintuitive. At first he thought like man I just need to like pound it out, you know like go harder more stimulation than sex and then he'd be able to ejaculate. That's actually the opposite of what was helpful for him. He needed to actually become more sensitive to sensitize his body to to go on a fast, right? So he needed to stop watching porn. He needed to stop ejaculating so his system could chill out and become more sensitive to the fucking glorious beauty of a woman with him in a sexual experience. So I hope this is helpful for you. If you're struggling with this issue I would recommend trying to cut out porn entirely. I would recommend trying to not ejaculate for a while and and see what happens. See if that impacts your ability to ejaculate with your partner. You know these are just two possible culprits to this reason. There's all sorts of other ones like a fear of vulnerability and a list that I can go into at some other point, but that's what I got for you right now. Hopefully it's helpful. I'd love to hear how it lands for you. I'd love to hear if it is helpful. Please leave a comment below and subscribe if you want to see more videos like this because I am I'm totally I'm a geek about this stuff. I love talking about sex. I love exploring sex and I love figuring out how to help men have better sexual experiences because I didn't have anybody to guide me through this shit when I was younger, and I wish I did. So hopefully I can be that for some of y'all and I'll see you next time. Cheers.",4,3,4,2,3,2,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,3,2," 4

WMUcNE6uWFQ,"🎶 Also read, Here is why you aren't enjoying intercourse with your partner Dear Eve, Wakatinibania mapensi nachuku amuda kama sijamwaga. Pia, natoa jajoujangi, so help me. Dear Eve, when I have sex I take too long to ejaculate. In addition, I sweat a lot. Please help me. Dear reader, thank you for writing to me about your concerns. I will answer you in English and hope that you understand me all the same. As you have described your problem, it sounds like delayed ejaculation, a situation in which it can take a man a long time to reach sexual climax and produce sperm, which is what ejaculation is. When we thinking about delayed ejaculation, a good average is having sex for over 30 to 45 minutes beyond what feels good for you and your partner. In other words, the length of time you're having sex is not really the issue so much, as it is the feeling that if you wanted to, you couldn't reach your climax without struggling for it. Here are five reasons why a man may experience delayed ejaculation. Health also read, Dear women, here are things that men find unromantic if a man is in poor health, he may struggle to finish without a struggle. Diseases such as high blood pressure, thyroid problems, heart conditions, low testosterone levels, nerve damage e.g. From diabetes, chronic illnesses like cancer, chronic pain, depression and or other mental health illness are just a few of the conditions that can affect a man's sexual performance to the point of delaying ejaculation. If you think you could be having an illness that is contributing to your delayed ejaculation, please do see a doctor sooner rather than later. Even though I suspect you're sweating too much during sex as a result of fatigue, a doctor will be able to assess it and give your appropriate feedback. Medication Sometimes medications can have a direct negative impact on our sexual performance c.g. Some of those that treat depression, SSRIs, are actually noticated in the way of sexual desire and performance. In addition, if a man has a chronic condition requiring constant medication, over time it can begin to affect him. Does this mean that we should stop or avoid taking medication for the sake of better sex? No, not really, especially because many of them may impact our general lives more positively. It does mean letting your doctor know the truth so they can make alternative recommendations. Even when there may not be alternatives treatment interventions, there are always ways to continue to have an enjoyable sex life despite any challenges e.g. The intervention of a qualified sex therapist who can help you work around the problem. Destructive lifestyle Some people enjoy the recreational use of some drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. People even joke about having drunk sex or sex while high, but it is important to note that these substances have the possibility of altering your sexual performance and delaying ejaculation. All of these substances can be used to help you avoid the problem. Also read, 5 genius ways to get your man turned on drugs and or alcohol work by inhibiting blood flow to all the right places because you're out of it, while tobacco, cigarettes, shisha, hookah, constrict your blood vessels, which means that the biological sensations that are necessary for arousal up to ejaculation are billed. It makes sense then your penis, mind and other pleasure centers would require more time, more energy and more effort just to reach climax and ejaculate. Sex is already a vigorous and tiring, albeit fun, exercise but with these substances, it is mostly an exhausting and draining affair. Destructive thoughts Many men who struggle with delayed ejaculation also report having negative attitudes and beliefs about sex e.g. overly religious backgrounds that equate sex to sin. Anxiety about sexual prowess and performance can also contribute to a man's inability or struggle to climax and ejaculate. If there is anxiety in a man's relationship or other areas of his life, his thoughts about that situation are likely to remove the joy sex, turning his sexual performance into a long, joyless and ultimately unsatisfactory experience. If your thoughts are interfering with your sexual performance and turning it into a struggle, I say this to you, guard your mind because your mind is your biggest and best sex organ. Destructive sexual behavior Engaging in sexual behavior that cannot be replicated in bed can interfere with a man's pleasure during intercourse thus delaying his climax and ejaculation. If, for example, you are masturbating too hard in a manner that cannot be replicated by the grip of vaginal muscles is likely to cause you problems. I've said before in this column that masturbation in and of itself is not the problem, the misuse of it is the problem. Here's a great example of how a man can turn a good thing into a sexually destructive thing. Masturbation is not mandatory, you don't have to masturbate if you don't want to. If you choose to masturbate, however, do it in a way that does not interfere with normal sexual intercourse for you and your partner. A good place to begin is to abstain for a while. All sexual bells and whistles can be added later, responsibly. I hope that you have gained some insight into what could be causing or contributing to your delayed ejaculation, and I hope that you use that insight to help you have a more enjoyable sex life, for your preferred duration. 2.

mfD4QCFeNMg,"Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. If you are a new subscriber, welcome. If you are a returning subscriber, stay tuned. So this is Paji Empire Sex Selection. In this channel, we do sex selection for couples who want to plan the sex of their children. And again, we also do other things. We discuss sexual matters, marriages, relationships, lifestyle measures. Apart from lifestyle measures, so many things. We also vlog in this channel. So today, I will be discussing delayed ejaculation. Delayed ejaculation, just like premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is when intercourse has lasted more than 30 minutes. Yes, when a man cannot come more than 30 minutes before intercourse. So the reason is, this thing is not a problem. It's not a problem because if your partner, like if your woman doesn't find it as a problem. Then like if both of you come at the same time, it will not really be a problem. But when it affects your relationship, that is when you will start looking for ways in order to help you out. At least so that both of you can reach orgasm at the same time. In women, we call it orgasm, while in men ejaculation. So in this video, I'm going to be discussing some things. You know it's a bit of a hick. I may not be pointing out everything. But if you have any questions, you can drop it in the comment section so that I can answer them. So stay tuned. A number of things can contribute to delayed ejaculation. I'm going to be mentioning seven things that can cause delayed ejaculation. Number one is psychological. Due to stress, depression, anxiety, that is anxiousness. You're anxious to meet your partner. You want to impress your partner. Maybe those kind of feelings can delay ejaculation. Sexual fantasies, like fantasizing to have a particular kind of pussy. You want to mount a tighter pussy. At the end of the day, you're mounting a loose pussy. I'm not just trying to say there is anything like a loose pussy. Yes, you're out there, you are laughing, you think that there is anything like a loose pussy. There is none. Just that a loose pussy can actually happen when... ...as a result of age and childbirth. And it can be sorted out anyway. It's not really that a loose pussy happens. It can happen because of childbirth and age. And it can be sorted out like when it should just be a different topic for another day. So, these are the things that are sexual fantasies. So, another one is called age. When, as you progress with age, you can lose that sexual pleasure. And it can delay your ejaculation or orgasm. It's not only in men, it's also in women. As you advance with age, you may not be finding sexual intercourse really interesting anymore. So, that is number two. So, number three is some medical treatments like surgery. Surgery to the prostate glands. Those things can actually affect your ejaculatory reflex. So, again, things like medications, like drugs, like anti-hypertensive drugs, diuretics. So many medications, even antidepressants can actually cause distance. And even muscle relaxants like diazepam. I understood that some people take diazepam or as in like they take it as normal medication. Like, or tramadol, something like tramadol. Some people take these medications. Maybe they want to be high or something. I don't know the reasons for taking these medications. But this kind of medication can actually cause delayed ejaculation. Or maybe some medications that you want to take in order to last longer. You see, those things can cause delayed ejaculation. So, if you take medications, please stop taking these medications. So, medical conditions. I'm mentioning number five now. Medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, can also predispose to delayed ejaculation. Number six is relationship problems like poor communication with your partner. If you're not telling your partner, look at the problem you have, you know, all those kind of things. It can generate two kinds. Another, excessive alcohol. Assessive alcohol if you are a heavy drinker, if you are a chain drinker. And even excessive smoking can also cause that as well. So, maybe you should look out for this, whether this is the reason why you are having delayed ejaculation. So, quickly let's go to the complications. Delayed ejaculation can predispose you into infertility. Yes, if you cannot ejaculate, you cannot impregnate your partner. So, guys, in my next video, I'm going to be talking about the remedies to help delayed ejaculation. I couldn't finish this video because of my kids. I had little distractions and I don't want to be dabbling into these things with distractions. So, I will see you guys in my next video. Please comment, like, share, give this video a thumbs up. I'll see you in my next video. Bye bye.",2,2,2,1,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,1," 2

t6PP67AsJaI,"Fetal surgery for spina bifida is an incredibly complex procedure. At Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the surgery was developed, a team of more than 20 people are in the operating room. They include up to four fetal surgeons, one neurosurgeon, two anesthesiologists, a maternal fetal medicine specialist, a fetal cardiologist and specialized nurses. They have performed this procedure more than any team in the world. Before surgery, the mother receives deep general anesthesia. Fetal surgeons make an incision across the mother's abdomen. The maternal fetal medicine specialist uses ultrasound to determine the position of the fetus and the margins of the placenta. The uterus is then opened with a specially designed uterine stapling device that controls bleeding, and the fetus is positioned so the spinal defect is visible. The fetal cardiologist monitors the baby's heart as the team closes the defect. The neurosurgeon removes a sac on the baby's back that covers the opening in the spinal cord. The sac is a thin membrane filled with fluid. The neurosurgeon and the fetal surgeon then close the defect in multiple layers using a lacing technique. First the muscle layers are closed over the defect. Then the skin is closed over the muscle layers. This ensures a watertight closure. The mother's uterus is closed in multiple layers, then her abdomen is closed and she is returned to her room. The pregnancy then continues until planned delivery at 37 weeks' gestation, most often in our Special Delivery Unit created for moms carrying babies with birth defects. ♪♪",5,4,5,3,5,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,2," 5

TuLAGDTpR6Y,"My name is Robin Bowman. I'm the director of Lurie Children's Multidisciplinary Spina Bifida Center and a fetal neurosurgeon with the Chicago Institute for Fetal Health, one of the few comprehensive fetal Care centers in the country. Approximately 1,500 babies are born each year in the United States with open spina bifida. In many cases, our experienced team can repair this birth defect while the baby is in the womb. This video demonstrates our minimally invasive fetoscopic repair for open spina bifida. This technique is designed to reduce the risk for mother and baby undergoing fetal surgery while preserving the option of vaginal delivery. Babies with open spina bifida who underwent back closure before birth have been shown to have long-term and improvement in their leg function, less of a need for hydrocephalus treatment, and improvement in the imaging of their brain. Open spina bifida occurs when the bones of a baby's back do not close properly. The baby's spinal cord extends through the open bones and attaches to the skin. This birth defect most often occurs in the baby's lower back region. Open spina bifida also has an impact on the developing brain. Babies with open spina bifida may develop an excess of spinal fluid known as hydrocephalus. The back part of their brain may also sink down into the neck. And this is known as hindbrain herniation. Fetal closure of the exposed spinal cord has been shown to help improve the hindbrain herniation and decrease the development of excessive brain water. The repair of an open spina bifida is done before 26 weeks gestation. Let's walk through this procedure. Once the mother is prepared for surgery and under anesthesia, we create an incision on her abdomen. A transverse or horizontal incision is made across the lower abdomen. In some cases a midline incision is made. The abdominal muscles are then opened in the midline. The abdominal cavity is entered. And the uterus is exposed. Intraoperative ultrasound is used to precisely identify the position of the baby in the placenta, which helps us plan our entry points while watching with the ultrasound. The initial port is inserted into the uterus. Warm, humidified carbon dioxide is then infused into the uterine cavity to expand our working field. We then insert a camera through the port and watch on the viewing screen as two additional 3 millimeter ports are inserted into the uterus. After all, three ports are inserted, the fetus is anesthetized and the back closure begins. We begin by releasing the spinal cord from the surrounding tissues. This allows the cord to relax back within the canal. We then close the spinal cord with a few stitches. Our attention is then turned to the dura or the tough membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, which holds in the spinal fluid. The dura is freed circumferential and closed in a watertight fashion. Lastly, the skin is undermined, enclosed in the midline. Occasionally, the defect is too large to allow primary skin closure. In this situation, a patch is used to close the skin opening. The fetal repair portion of the procedure is now complete. To further protect the baby for the duration of pregnancy, warm fluid and antibiotics are placed within the uterine cavity. All ports are removed, and the incisions are sutured closed. The mother's abdominal wall and skin are closed. The fetus continues to develop and heal for the duration of the pregnancy. During this time, the hindbrain herniation may also correct itself as the cerebellum will likely move back into place. Ideally, the pregnancy continues to full-term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally and cared for by our expert team of specialists. The Chicago Institute for Fetal Health and Lurie Children's Hospital is home to one of the oldest and largest multidisciplinary spina bifida centers in the world. This spina bifida team is comprised of a variety of surgical, medical, and rehabilitation experts, who are focused on assisting each child with open spina bifida reach and maintain their highest developmental potential.

4xOGmPla7e0,"... Hi, my name is Jason Hsu, and I am an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Keck School of Medicine here at USC. I'm also a pediatric neurosurgeon that works at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and I'm excited to talk to you a little bit about some of our ongoing work and our experience with fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. So myelomeningocele is a central nervous system malformation that occurs extremely early in life, and it results from a failure of primary neuralation where the caudal neural port fails to go from a sheet and roll over it to form a tube. The resultant malformation not only affects the spinal cord, but also the nerves, the bones, the muscles, and the skin in the back. There are also secondary effects that can occur in the brain as a result of this malformation lower down in the spinal cord. And in this picture, we can see our myelomeningocele in this newborn baby, but what's not immediately obvious in this picture is the other malformations that can occur within the brain, weakness in the legs or paralysis in the legs, bladder dysfunction, scoliosis, as well as symptomatic hydrocephalus. The traditional way that a myelomeningocele is treated is to repair it after the babies are born. However, a lot of work done in the 90s had looked for ways to repair the myelomeningocele lesion prenatally. And the researchers had shown that prenatal repair was effective in protecting the existing neural elements from continued injury in utero, as well as preventing spinal fluid leak from the myelomeningocele itself with a secondary effect of restoration of more normal CSF hydrodynamics. All of this work had resulted in a large randomized control trial that was published approximately 10 years ago. This trial is called the Management of Myelomeningocele, or MOMS trial, and the investigators had found improvements in rates of symptomatic hydrocephalus that required treatment, as well as improved motor outcomes in a number of the patients that were repaired prenatally. The benefits to the infants, however, did not come without risks. And there was noted to be very significant maternal morbidity related to prenatal repair, including severe complications such as placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, resulting in prematurity within many of the babies born, as well as a need for a C-section for the current pregnancy, as well as any future pregnancies. This is a picture of how the MOMS trial investigators had completed the prenatal repair. And what some of the maternal morbidity came about from was not only was a laparotomy required, but a hysterotomy was also required where the uterus is open in order to gain access to the myelomeningocele lesion. Despite the maternal risks, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has gained traction worldwide. Several centers within the United States have started fetal programs for myelomeningocele. In addition, several of these programs have attempted to refine the procedure so that there's less maternal risk and less trauma to the uterus. This is a technique that's described by Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Another technique had involved a hybrid approach where the uterus was externalized, however, the procedure was completed in a minimally invasive fashion where laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments were placed within the uterus in order to complete the myelomeningocele closure. Additionally, other groups, mainly actually in Europe as well as South America, have attempted to complete the myelomeningocele repair through a purely percutaneous approach involving the placement of the laparoscopes and working channels and laparoscopic instruments in a minimally invasive fashion through the skin. While this minimally invasive approach has mainly been done outside of the United States, here at USC we've collaborated with a group in Miami to try and bring this technique here. To date, USC and CHLA is currently only one of two centers in the United States to offer this percutaneous, fetoscopic repair for myelomeningocele. We are currently conducting a phase one study to evaluate its safety, and our goal is to try and achieve similar outcomes for our infants as the MOMS trial while improving maternal outcomes. This is a picture of our team, and as you can see, it's a very multidisciplinary team that not only involves fetal surgeons, OBGYNs, neurosurgeons, but also spina bifida, pediatricians, radiology as well as neonatologists. As you can see, it really takes a village to try and complete this work. We've done our first case in February of 2019, and as of October 2020, we've done 28 cases of 27 patients split between here and our collaborators over in Miami. This is a video of one of our cases, and here we have introduced our laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments. You can see the neuroplakode from before, and using laparoscopic scissors, we're able to carefully dissect out the neuroplakode and preserve any neural elements. After separating out the neuroplakode and the malformed spine from some of the surrounding tissue, you can see it pops down into a more normal position within the spinal cord. And once that's complete, we proceed with closure, and we try to do a multilayer closure to provide as much coverage and protection to the spinal cord as possible. So here, what we're doing is we're elevating and raising some of the muscles beside the spine to provide an extra barrier called the myofascial flap. This is a piece of dura repair, which we're using to reconstruct the fecal sac, and the myofascial flap is closed over top of this. Here you can see the myofascial flap is completed with complete coverage of our monomaniacal lesion. And you can see this, the skin is closed with a running suture. Here are some of our early results. In comparison to the MOMS trial, thus far we've had very similar gestational ages at delivery. One thing that's immediately apparent is the lower rate for cesarean section, and the other 13 patients were actually delivered vaginally, which was something that was not seen in the MOMS trial. We're still calculating our maternal risks, but thus far they've been comparable to what was seen in the MOMS trial. In terms of our infant results, we've seen very similar results in the MOMS trial as well. Of course, more data analysis is needed. However, what we've experienced is that we have had pretty comparable rates for the need for hydrocephalus treatment, as well as those improvements in motor outcomes. So in summary, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has become an increasingly popular treatment modality worldwide. The results of the MOMS trial had demonstrated improved infant outcomes in terms of symptomatic hydrocephalus, as well as motor outcomes. However, this did come with risks to MOM. Currently, in the United States, USC is undergoing a phase one trial as a collaborative work that's assessing the safety and feasibility of fetoscopic surgery in the United States. And our early data thus far has been very encouraging. Thanks for watching. And this picture here is a picture of our first patient. And that patient is doing extremely well. They have not required treatment for hydrocephalus and are able to ambulate independently. And this is another picture of a patient here who's approximately six months old and has been doing quite well.",5,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,4," 5

N_MaRhpBo6A,"It's important to understand that not all families want to have fetal surgery because of the requirements and the commitments and the risks that are involved. Families may come to us, undergo the diagnostic testing, and the defect may not be a defect that is included in the criteria for the surgery. Even if a family is an ideal surgery candidate, this may not be the best thing for them. And it is our obligation to help them understand that that's alright, that that's okay, that that's their choice, that that is the right choice for them. For families that want the traditional approach of having surgery after birth but still want to deliver at our center because of our multidisciplinary experience and care, we follow them as well. We generally have them come back at monthly intervals so we can monitor growth and development of the baby to look for progression in the hydrocephaly and all the markers of complications. We generally deliver them at around 37 weeks. The mother usually has a cesarean section in the special delivery unit. Our goal is to deliver the baby without any additional trauma to the myelomeningocele sac and also not to rupture the sac but to deliver the myelomeningocele intact. The baby then is evaluated by a neonatal resuscitation team. We have special equipment ready so that we can do different positions knowing that that spinal cord is still exposed. The baby then goes to the NICU where all the multiple subspecialties come and evaluate the baby. Neurosurgery generally take the baby to the operating room within the first 24 to 48 hours of life and do the neurosurgical repair. The technical aspects are pretty much the same whether I do it prenatally or postnatally. I have the same layers, I do essentially the same operation. The beauty of our facility is that we have our own delivery suite right here in the children's hospital so mother and baby are in the same place. So mother delivers, we get to look at the baby, we close the back the next day, I can talk to the mother about how things went and she can hold the baby the next day.",4,4,4,3,4,5,3,2,4,4,4,2,4,5,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, but there are some parts that could be better explained. The video discusses the different options for families who have a baby with a spinal cord defect, including fetal surgery and traditional surgery after birth. It also explains the process of delivery and the surgical repair for the defect. However, some terms and concepts, such as ""myelomeningocele"" and ""hydrocephaly,"" are not defined for a general audience. Additionally, the video could provide more information on why some families might choose fetal surgery over traditional surgery, and what the criteria are for determining eligibility for fetal surgery."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript achieves its aims partially. It provides information about the different approaches to surgery for spina bifida, including fetal surgery and surgery after birth. It also explains the process and the benefits of delivering at the center with a multidisciplinary team. However, the transcript could be more concise and focused on the main points, as it contains some unnecessary details and repetitions."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses the different options and considerations for families who have a baby with a spinal cord defect called myelomeningocele. The video explains the benefits and risks of fetal surgery, as well as the traditional approach of having surgery after birth. It also describes the process of delivery and care at the hospital. However, the video could be more relevant if it provided more information about the long-term outcomes and quality of life for babies with this condition, as well as the specific criteria for fetal surgery."," 3

Explanation: The video is clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication in some aspects, but not in others. The author mentions the multidisciplinary experience and care of their center, which implies that they are using the expertise of multiple specialists. However, the author does not explicitly mention any other sources of information, such as research articles, clinical trials, or guidelines from professional organizations. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video transcript is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The speaker explains the different options for families regarding fetal surgery and the traditional approach, as well as the process and care involved in both cases. The speaker also shares their experience and expertise in performing the surgery, both prenatally and postnatally. However, the transcript could be more concise and focused, as it covers multiple aspects of the topic."," 5

Explanation: The video transcript is balanced and unbiased because it presents different options for families with spina bifida, including fetal surgery and traditional surgery after birth. It also acknowledges that not all families may want fetal surgery and that it is their choice. The video does not promote one option over the other, but rather informs the viewers about the available options and the care provided by the center."," 3

The video provides some details about the support and information available for families who choose not to have fetal surgery or who opt for traditional postnatal surgery. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of additional sources of support and information. The video focuses mainly on the medical aspects of the surgery and the care provided by the center, but it does not mention other organizations or resources that could help families in similar situations."," 2

The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, it mentions that not all families want to have fetal surgery due to the requirements, commitments, and risks involved. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and that families must weigh the pros and cons of the procedure. Second, it states that some families may undergo diagnostic testing, but the defect may not be one that is included in the criteria for surgery. This means that even after testing, there may still be uncertainty about whether surgery is appropriate or not. Third, the video discusses the traditional approach of having surgery after birth, which involves monitoring the baby's growth and development and looking for progression in hydrocephaly and other complications. This suggests that there is ongoing uncertainty about how the baby will develop and whether the surgery was successful. Finally, the video describes the technical aspects of the surgery, which are essentially the same whether performed prenatally or postnatally. This indicates that there is still some uncertainty about the best timing for the surgery and its long-term outcomes. Overall, the video refers to areas of uncertainty"," 4

Explanation: The video describes how the surgery works in general, but it does not go into detail about the specific treatment for each condition.

However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the risks between the two approaches, which would have been helpful for viewers to make an informed decision."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It mainly focuses on the different options for treatment and the process of surgery, both prenatal and postnatal. It briefly mentions that some families may not want surgery, but it does not provide any information on the consequences of not receiving treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life in the sense that it presents different options for families with a baby affected by myelomeningocele, a spina bifida-related condition. The video explains the benefits and risks of fetal surgery and the traditional approach of having surgery after birth. It also shows how the center monitors the baby's growth, development, and complications, and how the delivery and surgery are performed to minimize additional trauma and ensure the best possible outcome for the baby. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the quality of life outcomes for babies treated with fetal surgery versus the traditional approach, nor does it address the long-term effects of the surgery or the impact on the family's emotional well-being. Therefore, the video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life."," 5

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The transcript mentions that not all families want to have fetal surgery, and some may choose the traditional approach of having surgery after birth.

LHwQeNHc0TE,"We of course had the life plan, you know, pay off the student loans, house with the backyard, travel a bit, kids. Had a pretty good pregnancy the first 16 weeks and then they called us and said that the protein in the blood was elevated which is abnormal and that led us to eventually getting Jack's diagnosis and everything changed in that moment. Myelomeningocele is a birth defect that children have that about 80% of them or so are going to, in addition to having the issues associated with the spinal cord defect, will also develop hydrocephalus. The issue of hydrocephalus or water on the brain which is a lifetime problem, is a problem that requires management when it develops. It requires often multiple surgeries over a lifetime. The prenatal surgery eliminates that for a significant percentage of children. These kids are not coming back to the hospital as frequently with issues related to their hydrocephalus because they simply don't have it. The morning of the surgery we got up and I remember feeling fairly calm. I think that I was pretty comfortable and knew what to expect and we had met with everyone enough that I knew what the procedure was going to be and knew how it was going to go. I knew that they were going to stay in touch with Kevin. Remember they came in and they were ready to take me and they asked, do you want to walk in or do you want to go in a wheelchair? And I was like, I can still walk in. I want to walk in. Like, let's do this. I remember you walking away down that hallway. This isn't a neurosurgery program. This isn't an MFM program. This is a fetal care program. So the fetal care program is a multidisciplinary group that includes all the specialists that would interact with mom's care. To have a program where you can offer complex fetal surgery, it requires the presence and the infrastructure of a strong overall collaborative program. The objective of surgery is to close the myelomeningocele with as little or no scar tissue as possible and to recreate the layers that should have normally formed. And so it's to close the placode or the neural tissue into a tube and to close the dura or the covering of the spinal cord as it should have normally formed. Ideally to pull in fascia or connective tissue as it normally would be there and then to have the skin covering so that they don't need to be treated for hydrocephalus. And then Dr. Goodnight came out after the procedure was done and gave us an update and said everything went well and you were up resting in the recovery room and that we'd be able to come and see you. You know, overall you were, you were a trooper. We were well cared for. We had a good team. Even to this day when I tell people about Jack's diagnosis and what that means, it's not until you meet him that you can see beyond the diagnosis. Hi buddy. Okay, are you ready? Yeah. Hi buddy. I've been fortunate enough to do this long enough now that I've watched people graduate from high school, get married, have families, have jobs. I joke with them when they come to my clinic that I'm going to schedule extra visits so that they can just come see me and visit me in clinic because I love hearing how they're doing and how they're developing and you know how they're doing in school and things forward. He gives you the sweetest looks and the biggest smiles all the time and he's just, he's a really good boy and he's very resilient. He's really the opposite of the picture that was painted for us when we got his diagnosis in December. Every doctor we met with in the UNC fetal surgery team, they were so patient and they just took the time to make sure that we were very comfortable. Their optimism and hope really gave us optimism and hope.",4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

I was lucky enough to connect with the first six moms that had fetal surgery at Mott. - When I was on bed rest after the fetal surgery, I got connected with Erica, who happens to be the fetal surgery number two. We were number three. - It started out as just us fetal surgery moms, and then it's growing. - [Nicole Sandulowich] So through the Mott system, we've connected. - [Erica Hopp] And so we decided that we wanted our children to experience the community of having kids that had the same thing that they did, but they have a common bond and so we decided a camping trip would be fun. - When the doctors tell you the worst case scenarios, you get scared to death. Cruz is now a very happy, strong boy. He does everything independently. You just gotta look for the future. You've gotta be positive and know that it's not always the worst case scenario that comes out. - From the moment we got to Mott for our first appointment, we were blown away by the kindness and the professionalism that we had there. They were so pivotal in getting us to the point of, you know, when we got there to where we are now. Kids with spina bifida are resilient. They are stronger than any person I've ever known.

hwKXYIiUUmo,"I was going in for my ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby and they had found out one of my tests that came out positive, my blood test. So they sent me to a specialist, a terrible in general, to see exactly what was going on and then she found out the defect. So then they sent me here to find out more exactly about the defect. As part of prenatal testing you do what's called a quad screen and the quad screen actually will look to see if your baby is at risk for having a hole in the spine and it just so happens that her quad screen back is positive and it said, hey look closer at this baby's spine, there may be something going on with it. She just let us know that was a spinal defect and you know what can cause it and what we would be dealing with and then she told me that we would have to come here to really figure out you know exactly where it was and exactly what our outlook was. Spina bifida is a failure of the closure of the back, particularly of both the spine and the spinal cord to properly form in the first month after the baby is being developed. And when that happens it leads to a defect in the back and the spinal elements that actually stick out of the back often in a sac that can be nonfunctional and that can lead to problems with movement of the limbs below that level of impairment that can involve sensation impairment below the level. Use of the bowel or the bladder properly is difficult due to those and there's also an association with hydrocephalus or fluid in the brain that accumulates due to that abnormality. Back in 1997 was the first procedure where they actually were, where someone took the chance of saying let's open up the uterus, let's close this defect and let's see if we can't keep these outcomes from happening or can we make better outcomes. Between 1997 and 2003 there was about 200 of these cases done across the nation and people were saying hey we're getting better outcomes with these babies than we are if we left them alone. And there was a lot of debate about well is it really worth the risk to the maternal health, is it really worth the risk to the fetal health, this is a dangerous thing to do, some of the medicines you're doing are very dangerous for the pregnancy, is this really the right thing to do? And so what happened was back in 2003 the NIH supported a study what they called the MOMS trial. All the pediatric surgeons got together and said we are not going to offer this until we kind of get an idea if this makes a difference or not. And so that was actually published in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine and that's the study that really kind of got us fired up here is because it actually showed that there are better outcomes. We're able to make these babies do better with this in utero procedure and so me and Dr. Bui had got together and said listen this is something that we need to offer in the region. I think we have enough volume of these babies that we see in my clinic to make this technique that we can offer here at Oster. So we're able to actually have a window up in the uterus and then be able to bring just the babies back through. So once we're able to get to the defect then the night takeover and under high magnification we actually do the repair. The good thing about Oster is that we have pediatric neurosurgeons, we have a pediatric cardiologist, we have a high risk pregnancy doctor, we have high risk anesthesia. We've got everything that we need here. The team was well prepared and that gave me a lot of confidence that we would be able to pull it off without any problem. We've been fortunate so far none of those children as of yet have required a shunt to be placed for hydrocephalus. They're doing very well with their growth. They do still continue to have some bowel and bladder problems but they're very manageable and they have had less overall orthopedic and neurologic impairment because of the surgery than they likely would have otherwise had. I think it's definitely a landmark procedure for Oster but it's also a landmark procedure for the state. I think this is a first in the state if not the region. Currently there are less than 10 programs in the country and that's because it does require quite a bit of expertise. I think that this really does highlight what Oster does well which is to bring together a lot of high end specialists into one area. His name is Kobe Damian Boudreau. He weighed four pounds and twelve ounces when he was born and that's 17 inches and a half long. Pretty much after the surgery his outcome is pretty much good. He's moving his legs like he should and his ultrasound of his brain came out fine and his incision looks good. He's doing pretty good. So this doesn't look very dissimilar from just a normal baby without spina bifida at this point. That's good. Okay so I think that you know the at least right now I don't have any real concern for a shunt and as far as the back and whether there's any leakage or breakdown of the wound the back looks about as good as we can hope for. I think that's you know because the baby had all that time of year within the belly. You had the absolute best result that we could have a whole family. Very, very happy about it. Yeah so well we'd get them. Oster has always been on the forefront in a number of areas of trying to do things that are game changers, really make a difference for the patient and this is one of those instances where you really are making a difference for the patient and over the years there have been some of those in adults and some of those in children and this is one that is really going to be a great advance for children. Now that he's here and we've gone through everything I'm very, very happy that we went ahead and did it because his outcome does look a lot better than what it would have been if we didn't do the surgery so I'm very happy about that. You know the difference for a family having a wheelchair bound kid versus a kid that can you know that can walk that's what makes it worth it is the ability to really change one's kids whole entire life with an operation early on.",4,4,5,3,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4," 4

Explanation: The video is partially clear about its aims. The transcript provides a detailed explanation of spina bifida, the surgery, and the outcomes. However, it lacks a clear introduction or statement of the main purpose of the video.

dSjzCM4-6Y0,"Fetal surgery is about trying to save the lives or improve the lives of children by doing something before birth. It sounds like a crazy idea, operating inside the womb, but it's actually 30-years-old now and we've been doing it a long time. Spina bifida is a birth defect where the spinal cord and the spine don't form normally before birth. It fails to close. And because of that, that spinal cord is exposed to the elements in utero and then in theory, after birth. In the old days, we just took care of that problem after birth and protected the spinal cord, closed up the skin so that children would not get infected. They wouldn't get meningitis, an infection in the spinal cord, but we never had the expectation that it would improve their paralysis. We just assumed that paralysis was part of the problem of spina bifida. But we started to learn through the advent of ultrasound and by doing some studies in mice and things like that, that it appeared that the spinal cord, even though it was exposed was normal when it was formed. And it just seemed to lose function during gestation, that it was the trauma in utero. The exposure to amniotic fluid, just bumping up against the uterine wall that actually damaged the spinal cord. So, gosh, almost 20 years ago now, we asked the question, if we operated before birth, could that make the outcomes better? That's a study that was called the MOMS Trial. And interestingly, that was just finishing at the time I came to UC Davis. And what we discovered was that if you operated before birth, if you did fetal surgery, that in fact, those children did have a better outcome. I mean, this was miraculous. For the first time, the babies had some improvement in the ability to move their legs and it appeared that the spinal cord was somewhat improved. And I thought, ""If we can get some improvement, maybe we can get more improvement."" We looked at different kinds of cells. iPS cells were popular at the time, but we finally settled on mesenchymal stem cells from the placenta. We collaborated with Jan Nolta's group in the Institute for Regenerative Cures here at UC Davis, got advice and assistance from her. And then we took these special cells from the placenta, cultured them in a unique way that allowed these cells to secrete what I like to call ""magic stem cell juice."" We don't know exactly how it works, but we certainly know that it secretes lots of important growth factors for the spinal cord. We used a patch that is already approved by the FDA to repair problems either in the spinal cord or the brain when they need an extra layer to sort of close up what we call the dura, the lining of the central nervous system of the brain and the spinal cord. And we thought, ""Well, let's see if our cells can grow on this already FDA approved ""dural patch."" And not only did they grow, they seem to love it, but it's the same repair that was done for the big national trial. But this time we'll use a repair that includes this patch with cells on it. The reason it's important to do it almost exactly the same way it was done before is so that we can compare the results in a similarly rigorous fashion. So that we know it's really the cells that are making a difference.",4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4," 4

jpFLPfsUr1c,"Heather Jovanola, MD My name is Heather Jovanola. Brian Jovanola, MD And I'm Brian Jovanola. Our son Thomas is three and a half. Heather Jovanola, MD Thomas is our first son. So he was my first pregnancy. We did all the normal testing that you thought they would do. All my test results came back perfectly normal. And then when we went in at 21 weeks for our mid-pregnancy ultrasound, that was the first time that we saw that there was something wrong. That there was, you know, developmentally they were seeing some signs in his head and some signs on his back that he had this diagnosis of spina bifida that we had never heard of before. Dr. Heather Jovanola, MD For a young couple, finding out that they have a fetus with a problem is one of the most devastating things that can ever happen. One of the reasons that we fetal surgeons wanted to attack the problem of spina bifida is that spina bifida results in lifelong disability. A child is born with this disease and has it for life. And there's very little that's been able to be done after birth to improve the outcomes of these children. Brian Jovanola, MD And in the past, the surgical treatment for that has simply been to repair the defect which is in the lower back. And it mainly is a way to protect the skin, protect the nervous system, but not as a way to try to improve any of the disability that the patients have. Dr. Heather Jovanola, MD What the doctors at UCSF made sure we knew was that this was a huge risk to me as a mother. So the baby has to have the surgery at some point to close up his back, but he doesn't have to have it right now. On the other hand, UCSF is very good at this. We pioneered prenatal surgery. So that was very comforting going in, even though we knew this is a big deal. It was a long day. And finally the doctor came walking out, big smile, said, your son has a really cute butt. And so we kind of knew everything was okay when he was joking around. It was a big relief. I think for mothers who have a fetus diagnosis of spina bifida, I think it becomes an extremely important consideration and a very compelling case to be made to consider a fetal surgery very seriously. Another thing he'll do, and we love to have him do it, is when he comes grocery shopping with me, he wants to walk around and see all the things that are right at his eye level. He wants to grab things off the shelf and put them in the cart. So we let him do that. And he can handle walking for an hour and a half in the grocery store because it's so much fun for him to have the freedom to move around and see whatever he wants to see. And that really makes us feel good that the choices we've made and him being able to have the surgery have on some level allowed him to be that mobile instead of in a wheelchair.",4,5,5,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,4," 4

Yh47aMX-_9M,"So myelomeningocele is the most common form of spina bifida and it results from lack of closure of the primitive spinal cord which is the neural tube in the fetus at the bottom end and so the spinal cord and nerve roots and covering layers of the spinal cord are fused to the skin and muscle and it leaks spinal fluid out and leads to other complications over time including a Chiari malformation and subsequent hydrocephalus or the build-up of spinal fluid in the head and patients who undergo postnatal closure have an approximate 80% risk of hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventricular peritoneal shunt which is an implanted device. Unfortunately shunts are associated with a lot of morbidity and complications during childhood and life for children with spina bifida and myelomeningocele. So why do we do this in utero? For generations this repair has been done postnatally but as pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons what we found is that over time the dye is already cast by the time the baby is born. Obstetricians have noticed for several years now that they've been able to see many of these fetuses moving their legs in utero but by the time they're born they're no longer able to move their legs and they're paralyzed. So it was thought really that there's some ongoing injury that occurs during the pregnancy. The goal of doing this operation early before birth is to try to improve the function of the baby, to improve their leg strength and perhaps their bowel and bladder function and also importantly to minimize their risk of developing hydrocephalus that conditioned fluid on the brain. And when they do develop hydrocephalus and they need a shunt those shunts unfortunately don't work perfectly and they lead to all kinds of complications and it turns out that by doing this operation before birth it seems to cut that shunt rate in half and so we're very optimistic that we can have that same result for this infant. The patient is Naomi, she's 23 years old and this is essentially her first pregnancy to this point and the baby is around 25 weeks gestation, remembering of course that a normal pregnancy gestation is around 40 weeks so we're just a little tiny bit over halfway in the pregnancy. The baby has an open spinal defect called a spina bifida and the object of the surgery today is to close that lesion for a number of reasons. The leakage of the fluid out of this open lesion does two things at least that we know of. One is to expose the nerves to the amniotic fluid and two is to allow the leaking of fluid such that the cerebellum at the base of the brain can undergo pressure, this is called a Chiari 2 malformation and that kind of pressure on the intracranial structures can result both in issues with the cerebellum and with the ventricles of the brain so the baby's ventricles can become dilated. So by closing this lesion we're hoping to prevent ongoing injury and hopefully preserve neurologic function and in even some cases we believe it's possible to regain some neurologic function. It's a rather tricky operation that we did today. It's open fetal surgery so the mother is asleep under a very deep anesthetic. We have to then perform a C-section type incision on the mother to open up her tummy and to expose the uterus and then we have to open the uterus. This is the pregnant uterus that's filled with amniotic fluid so we have to open that up and the amniotic fluid will come out and then we expose this spina bifida deformity in the fetus and then the neurosurgeons Dr. Bolo and Jay today came in and did that repair of that spina bifida defect and then very importantly we then have to close that uterus up with stitches and keep it pregnant and keep the baby inside the uterus and we have to have it so it doesn't leak that amniotic fluid and that the pregnancy can continue and that's where this becomes pretty tricky and pretty difficult. Well so far the operation went perfectly today. We were able to open the uterus very nicely, expose the deformity in the fetus, the spina bifida repair seemed to go very smoothly and we were able to get that uterus closed up very nicely and so far mom and baby are recovering very well. I don't see any signs of labor. The uterus seems to be snugly closed and the mother is now recovering from the anesthesia and she's doing very well. It was really a multidisciplinary total force with all the different disciplines present everybody worked well seamlessly perfectly, it was a well choreographed perfectly executed surgical procedure. It's not often that surgeons use the palliatives but this is actually one of those times that I think it's rightfully deserved.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

m5N2fFPzKBc,"Probably the most expectant time that families have is once they go home, what's going to happen then. And I think that is a major hallmark of our center that we continue to follow these babies. It's important to bring all the healthcare professionals to the baby. So that's what we do in the multidisciplinary spina bifida clinic at CHOP. The spina bifida program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was the first multidisciplinary program in the world. So there's 50 years plus of experience. It's an interdisciplinary, comprehensive spina bifida program that really is geared at long-term management. And there are hundreds of kids in the program as well as adults. The impact of these babies is very important for their care, but one additional issue and benefit is that these patients teach us. Only with that ongoing commitment of these parents to share their lives and their children with us are we going to continue to provide that information for future generations.

aW_mLBlZES8,"Everything was going well with the ultrasounds and the checkups and on our 18th week they said we wouldn't hear from them unless there was an issue. The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless. Words can't express our gratitude and our thanks for the blessings that they've given us with our child. We couldn't ask for anything more.",4,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5," 4

NjQBq0GH8BM,"Hello, my name is Dr. Gina Miller and I am the leader of the Fetoscopic Spina Bifida Repair Program at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy. In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible. If you have additional questions about this procedure, please contact us. We are always eager to help. Thank you for your attention. .",5,4,5,3,5,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,2," 5

kuMHLfb8U_E,"It was just like, you know, any normal pregnancy that starts out. We were just going to our OBGYN appointment and just someone was saying that he looked good. So the doctor's doing the ultrasound and I'm thinking nothing of it. I mean, what are we looking at? And honestly, I fully expected him to say, oh, it's okay, everything's fine, you know, nothing to worry about. But he didn't. He said, yeah, we're looking at a case of spina bifida. It's a pretty severe case. Worst case scenario, they can't walk, you know, that they have trouble going to the bathroom and all of that. And I was just like, what do I do? So the doctor then took a plane to us. He said, well, there's a surgery that they can do while they're in utero, you know, and they can repair that. In utero surgery to close up spina bifida is basically to close up the defect of the baby's back to keep further damage from occurring that could occur if the closure happens after the baby's born. Something inside me said, you need a second opinion. I hadn't given up that faith. Fetal surgery is the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. It leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability. The day that Dr. Cass told us that they would be willing to do the surgery, Kimmy was 25 weeks pregnant and three days. They don't do the surgery past 26 weeks. The operation went perfectly and the outcome for both the mom and the fetus were as good as possibly could be expected. The scar on his back looks great. It's healing the way we want it to heal and everything was looking good. There's no word to express how grateful I am to everybody that was involved. I want him to do all the normal things that Boyd growing up should be able to do, but also through this be able to help other people. He has a purpose for his life, even if it is just telling the story to other people as he grows up to give them hope. He has a best life with three kids under the age of three.

Additionally, the transcript does not mention any other treatments for spina bifida, so the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes the benefits of the treatment for spina bifida, which is in utero surgery. The speaker explains that the surgery can close up the defect of the baby's back, preventing further damage and leading to the best outcome with the least amount of long-term disability. The video also shows the successful outcome of the surgery for the baby, who can now grow up and do normal things. However, the video does not describe other treatments for spina bifida, so it is not a complete description of the benefits of each treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe the risks of each treatment. The risks of not treating spina bifida are mentioned, such as the baby being unable to walk and having trouble going to the bathroom. The benefits of fetal surgery are also discussed, such as leading to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the risks and benefits of different treatments for spina bifida, so it does not fully describe the risks of each treatment."," 4

The video does partially describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The doctor mentions that in the worst-case scenario, the baby would have trouble walking and going to the bathroom due to spina bifida. However, the video mainly focuses on the successful surgery and the positive outcome for the baby. It does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the potential consequences of untreated spina bifida."," 5

The video does describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video shares the story of a pregnant woman who was informed that her baby had spina bifida, a condition that could severely impact the baby's quality of life. The doctor suggested an in utero surgery to repair the spina bifida while the baby was still in the womb. The surgery was successful, and the baby's quality of life was significantly improved. The mother expresses her gratitude for the successful surgery and hopes that her child can live a normal life and help others by sharing his story. The video demonstrates how the treatment choice of in utero surgery can positively affect the overall quality of life for a baby with spina bifida."," 4

The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The transcript mentions one specific treatment option, which is in utero surgery, and it is described as the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. However, it does not explicitly mention other treatment options or alternatives, so it is not entirely clear if there are no other choices or if there are more."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as the mother in the video seeks a second opinion before deciding to proceed with the in utero surgery for her baby's spina bifida. However, the video does not provide a lot of information about the process of seeking a second opinion, the factors that influenced her decision, or how she weighed the potential benefits and risks of the surgery. The video mainly focuses on the outcome of the surgery and the mother's gratitude for the medical team. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' supports shared decision-making.",set(),96
qRtspxmhYnA,"Once a family decides to pursue fetal surgery, things happen pretty rapidly. All the components of our rather large team meet to discuss the case and then have the parents come in and we go through the entire process once again so that there's a clear understanding of what's involved and give them the opportunity to ask any additional questions. We had to be down here, I don't know if it was five o'clock or six o'clock, but it was very early in the morning. I was so nervous. And you know, still a lot of consultations and things like that going on and you know. Flurry of activity. They put an epidural in was the first thing they were going to do and I had to be awake for that. You are knocked out for the surgery. I remember bending over getting that epidural and they're talking to me and all of a sudden you go, oh, I mean if it hadn't hit us already, it hit me then. This is big time. Seventeen days before that, life was normal and all of a sudden here we are. We're doing fetal surgery for something that's cutting edge. We have a special OR that we use for fetal surgery. It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue. Once the uterine wound is closed, the maternal abdomen is closed, including the skin with a plastic surgical closure. All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4," 4

Wn2wqi7QbsY,"(bouncy music) - Hi, I'm Karin Muraszko. I'm the Chair of Neurosurgery here at the University of Michigan and what I'd like to talk to you about today is what happens after the baby is born. A child with spina bifida will have life-long issues that will need to be addresses and followed up with doctors in a variety of subspecialties. In the first hours of life, a group of physicians including the neonatologist and neurosurgeons will assess a child in the intensive care unit. The neonatal intensive care unit is generally the place where such children are placed shortly after birth. It's that assessment which helps us decide when and how we're going to take care of the child in the first days of life. So after the baby is born, one of the most important things that we need to make certain of is what we do for all children, which is are there any problems in terms of breathing? Are there any problems in terms of infection? Is their heart working well? And after we get through all of that, the vast, vast majority of children will have no problems in that area, we then are particularly interested as to whether the baby will have the development of hydrocephalus. The repair of the myelomeningocele usually occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours and the decision about whether any kind of diversionary procedure for the cerebral spinal fluid to deal with the hydrocephalus is something which also will be made within the first day or two of life. But in many cases dealing with the hydrocephalus is something which needs to be followed over time and therefore may not be done at the same time as the repair of the myelomeningocele. After that there are other additional things that need to be looked at. The doctors from urology and orthopedic surgery will examine the baby to make certain that the bladder and the bowel functions are okay, that there are no specific problems with how the legs are working or the spine. And the neurosurgeon will be particularly important to look at whether the baby has any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention. If the baby has had a repair of the myelomeningocele in utero then the neurosurgeon will be primarily looking at that repair site to make certain that it's okay and not having any problems. If the baby did not have a repair in utero then that's something that will also be done in the first days of life. The timing of that will depend a little bit on each child. We need to make certain that the baby is safe for an anesthetic and we also need to make certain that we often use our plastic surgery colleagues to help us make certain that there's adequate skin closure in these children. Over the lifetime of a baby they'll be necessary follow-up with each of the specialists I talked about. The neurosurgeon to make certain that the neurologic function continues and that there's no problem. The orthopedic surgeon to make certain that the spine, particularly with respect to scoliosis, and the lower extremities, particularly with respect to how they're formed and how the walking is going. And the urologist because almost all children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, have problems with their bladder and bowel function that will require the urologist to follow them. Children with myelomeningocele require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Because the life expectancy of a child with myelomeningocele is really quite good and that we expect them to grow up to be adults and to have normal lives with respect to their disabilities, we also recognize that it's a lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care to achieve the best results for these children. Therefore it's a group of specialists who understand the complexity of myelomeningocele, who'll be taking care of the child, not only as an infant but as a young adult and onwards into full adulthood.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects of the care and management of children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele. Some examples of these areas of uncertainty are:

1. The development of hydrocephalus, which may require diversionary procedures that need to be decided within the first day or two of life.
2. The repair of the myelomeningocele, which may be done in utero or in the first days of life, and may require additional neurosurgical intervention.
3. The timing and adequacy of skin closure, which depends on the repair of the myelomeningocele, the child's safety for anesthesia, and the involvement of plastic surgery colleagues.
4. The long-term follow-up with various subspecialists, such as neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and urologists, to address the lifelong issues related to spina bifida.

They are scheduled for an entire day of diagnostic testing and counseling. The diagnostic process involves radiologic studies, maternal fetal ultrasound that's usually two plus hours in duration in which we look at everything. How big the lesion is, what segments of the spine are involved. They look for the degree of hydrocephaly, evidence for the Chiari malformation, and we look for evidence of paralysis or function of the lower extremities. A fetal MRI that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes and requires the mother to be still inside the MRI chamber. A fetal echocardiogram to look at the fetal heart. Fetuses with myelomeningocele typically do not have any problems that are wrong with the fetal heart. However, as a fetal cardiologist, it's very important to make sure that we're not dealing with any abnormalities whatsoever of the heart, even if they're mild. Part of the evaluation when a family comes to our center is not only the detailed imaging of the fetus, but a careful evaluation of the mother herself. And then we meet with the family to go through the results of those tests and tell them what we know about the diagnosis. The counseling involves a multidisciplinary group. An experienced nurse, neurosurgeon, fetal surgeon, maternal fetal medicine specialist, social worker. This is a team that can provide information to the family, review the results of the tests, and present the options. It was amazing how much information they were able to convey, and we understood it. Very caring and it just made you feel like if they say this is an option for you, it was a potentially great thing for us. Families faced with the diagnosis of spina bifida in utero are now able to make choices. Many families after hearing the range and potential severities of the disabilities and problems these children face choose to terminate the pregnancy. They have the option of staying here at CHOP, delivering here, and we'll do conventional treatment, which is we'll deliver the baby and I'll close the back, put in the shunt, whatever's necessary in the newborn period. Or now they have the option of pursuing fetal surgery, which really does change the natural history of the disease as we knew it before.",4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,5," 4

gwSUxO8ahIU,"Our journey began back, I guess, in 2013. We found out we were pregnant with twins, so I was high risk. So we went to a specialist to have an ultrasound and one of the twins had passed and then I can remember the doctor just doing the ultrasound over Emerson to make sure everything looked good. He was taking a bit longer than I had expected, so I finally asked him, I said, is everything okay? And he said, you know, I'm looking at her head and he said, I'm seeing some signs that are indicative of spina bifida. And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her? And he said, it means that she will probably never walk. It's a birth defect where the back is open. She will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life. It was heart-wrenching at that time. It was a bad day, especially for my wife. You know, when you lose a child due to miscarriage and then get this diagnosis. So I immediately started researching that when we got home and that's when we found out about the fetal center here at Texas Children's. We were able to come in and do the qualification process, which is a two-day process. It was very, very intense, met with so many physicians, surgeons. It was a long day. When the patient is coming to us with a diagnosis of neuro tube defect, first we have a comprehensive evaluation of the fetus. The patient will have the fetal MRI ultrasound. The patient will have a meeting with our pediatric surgeons, with our pediatric neurosurgeons, and with the fetal intervention team. And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive. As she heads into the school years, I think her prognosis is second to none. She's a mess. She loves to run and jump and play and swim. Very spunky. She definitely has an independent streak, but she is so sweet, so full of life and joy.",4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5," 4

qPmzl95kOpo,"Our goal with fetal surgery repair for spina bifida is to get the mother to 37 weeks. Babies who undergo fetal surgery tend to be born prematurely and in the MALMS trial they were born at an average gestational age just beyond 34 weeks, but 10% were born at 30 weeks or prior to that time which is quite premature. Over 65% of them get past that 35 week mark and then it becomes a matter of timing of delivery. We've made an incision in the uterus that is not in a safe part of the uterus to allow the woman to labor in any pregnancy going forward. So the baby is delivered via a cesarean section in the special delivery unit. The special delivery unit was built for the mother carrying a baby with a birth defect, was built for the mother carrying a baby with spina bifida. We as the resuscitation team feel like we are very prepared for those deliveries. We have excellent communication with the obstetricians and we have access to all their prenatal imaging. We know those babies very well and we coordinate their delivery and their care. Dr. Johnson delivered Sean. He came out very healthy, 6 pounds 7 ounces. Which was a very good size for a child that's born at 36 and a half weeks. He was a big boy. We always make a point of bringing the baby to the mother prior to bringing the baby down to the NICU so that the mother and father and any relatives that they want can see the baby. And from there we take the baby straight down to the newborn infant ICU and the moms are close, you know they can come down as soon as they're feeling well and if there's something going on we're able to go straight back up to their unit.

Jfp3Up3dUr8,"It was our first child. We were very excited and of course we were doing the countdown like every new parent does. We were looking forward to having our first ultrasound for our new baby and start our family together. Well baby ultrasound they called it, you know, just to check everything out. No big deal. We weren't even going to find out if we were having a boy or a girl. And of course we didn't get exactly the great news we were expecting. The technician found that our child's brain was not forming correctly so we had to go to a higher level ultrasound. So we did that and they confirmed that we had a baby with spina bifida. And of course our lives were turned upside down. All those hopes, dreams and everything else you had for your child were just gone. In the context of families getting a new diagnosis of spina bifida they may or may not know much about it. It may not only be quite a shock but because they may not understand what that means is probably pretty terrifying. And we start talking about paralysis and catheters and shunts and wheelchairs and they start to cry because this is not what they imagined. All of their hopes and dreams for that child are readjusted, are reorganized. Most of the time they get this diagnosis before they actually come to see us so they've had some time to adjust to it. And one of our jobs at our center is to make sure that mothers have every option available to them. To educate them, to advise them, to help them so that whatever choice the mother and the family makes is the right one for them.",4,4,5,2,4,4,2,5,2,2,2,2,4,4,4," 4

jlDZA2PNW2o,"The term “spina bifida” comes from the latin “split spine,” which is actually a pretty good description, because spina bifida is a birth defect where the tissue on the left and right side of the back that normally come over the spinal cord to protect it, don’t completely meet up to form a nice seal, leaving behind various degrees of an opening right down the middle of the lower back. Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called ‘open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum—the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus—an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one’s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, ‘occulta’ is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don’t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don’t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn’t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she’s even pregnant, and therefore she’s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida—myelomeningocele—is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother’s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus’s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother’s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can’t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

6Ii_v3t9hpU,"Spina bifida, or its most severe form, myelomeningocele, is the most common central nervous system or neurologic birth defect in the world. Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray. And what it is, is that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, that has a lot to do with control of motor movements, is wedged down into your neck. The cerebral spinal fluid that cushions the brain and cushions the spinal cord leaks out through the back through the open spina bifida defect. That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain. The water isn't on the brain, it's inside the brain. If you don't treat that, then you end up with a massively enlarged head, you die, or you end up with severe mental retardation. So in order to minimize that ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, the pediatric neurosurgeon places a shunt tube. It's a simple device. This is a shunt. It's made out of silicone. This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function. So it's a lifelong issue of disability.",4,4,5,2,4,2,2,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,2," 4

In the school setting, he has been self-catheterizing since he was 3 years old. When we sent him to preschool at four, he went with a three-alarm watch and a bag of catheter supplies, and we gave him the confidence that he could do it. Josh Joines - I like being part of my medical team because they listen to me better than my parents. Angie Joines - From the very beginning we always thought that this spina bifida was just something on the side. We never allowed the spina bifida to come first. My name is, Ramu Mundakizhi Kaledi and I’m a Health Policy Analyst at the CDC. I graduated from Georgia State University, with a bachelor’s in public policy. My parents, especially my dad, pushed me to do things, just to lead a normal life. If I felt like I couldn’t do something he would push me. Everyone has to learn to be independent and living on their own, managing their own lives, I’m beginning to do that as well now. I go to my own doctor’s appointments and manage all my doctor visits and my medical issues. I play actually on a wheelchair league and, because it’s a wheelchair league, it’s a small league and it’s all about the community. If I could give a young person one major bit of advice, have dreams in life and, stick to those dreams. Everyone has adversities in life and your adversities although different from others aren’t going to keep you from accomplishing your dreams.",4,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,2,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

bLnYzCcTEEA,"In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is usually done between 20 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. The womb is then open to expose the back of the fetus using a specially designed staple to control bleeding. The tissue over the defect is then opened and removed. Next, the spinal cord is free from surrounding tissue before it is protected using the Dura. We then close the muscle layers over the defect to further protect the spinal cord. The skin of the fetus is then closed over the defect. If a fetus does not have enough tissue on its back for primary closure, we will repair the spinal defect using patches as shown here. First, we protect the spinal cord by suturing a patch over it before we lay down a second patch to reinforce the repair. We then close the large skin defect using a piece of skin substitute to complete the repair. We then close the womb and conclude the surgery by closing the mother's incision. Ideally, the pregnancy is continued until 37 weeks gestation before the baby is delivered by c-section.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,2," 4

asl-c1zmHmk,"(soft music) - Spina bifida is a fairly common birth defect that occurs in one to two out of every 1000 live births. What normally should occur early in fetal development or the development of your baby is the neural tube. Starts off as a flat plate of cells, and then around six weeks into development, that flat plate zips itself closes and forms the neural tube. Inside that tube, the nerves from our brain run down to our limbs, so to our arms and to our legs, and the neural tube forms a protective barrier so that those delicate nerves don't get damaged. In cases of spina bifida, also known as a neural tube defect, what happens is that zipping process doesn't go quite right and there can be a gap in the neural tube that allows those delicate nerves to come out of the body, usually out of the skin and they're damaged, as, in exposure to the amniotic fluid. When there is damage to those nerves when the babies are born, we do surgery to repair the opening, but the nerves have usually already suffered some damage. As a result, people or babies with spina bifida or children with spina bifida usually have some degree of paralysis or the inability to use their legs to some extent. So some people with spina bifida will undergo surgery and have a limp or need some sort of help with bracing. Other people with spina bifida will use a wheelchair, so there's some degree, but usually no matter when we are able to do surgery, there's some damage to those nerves. Spina bifida can happen in any pregnancy to any woman. We know there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida and those include moms who are diabetic, when there's been a family history of other individuals with a neural tube defect, or some women on certain medications. But most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk, and that's why we talk so much about folic acid. Folic acid is a B vitamin that we know helps reduce the incidence of spina bifida. Usually people get folic acid in their diet, but we recommend that any woman of any childbearing age take a vitamin that has 0.4 milligrams of folic acid. Because that neural tube closes so early in pregnancy, sometimes a neural tube defect has formed before a woman even knows she's pregnant. For women that we identify that are at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida, we'll typically recommend more folic acid so it's a good idea to talk to your OB if you're considering having a baby and think you have any risk factors that would increase the risk for this birth defect.",4,4,5,4,4,4,3,4,2,2,2,4,4,4,4," 4

YG4nrRnAlcc,"Decatur was actually brought to our attention before she was actually born. We knew that she had a fairly large myelomeningocele or what most people would understand as spina bifida. The spinal cord is open. If your spinal cord is open, that means your cerebral spinal fluid, it's all in communication with the outside world. So the biggest risk at that point is they can get an infection. If they get an infection, that's meningitis and that's very serious in a baby. But what we aim to do is close the skin, create a barrier between the outside world and the spinal fluid and therefore prevent an infection. Reach in with this forcep and grab the white band. Over time, it became obvious that Decatur was not actually going to be able to get away without needing a BP shunt. We follow the child's head circumference and if the head grows inappropriately, which is a sign of fluid under pressure, then we make arrangements to place a ventricular perineal shunt, which is the treatment for hydrocephalus. People who have hydrocephalus, they don't absorb the fluid, although they continue to make it. Yeah, I'll take a couple more of those and then some derma bond. So you need to move it somewhere else. So the shunt is basically plumbing to move the fluid from the brain down to the abdomen where it's ultimately reabsorbed into the bloodstream, just like it would be in the normal situation in the head. It looks good. And then once she finally got to the point where she had stabilized, was eating well, we were actually able to get her home at that point. There's our beautiful baby. We're enjoying her home right now. I think the one thing that gives these kids the best opportunity for the best outcome is that there is a coordinated kind of care center that our neurosurgeons and other specialists manage for the spina bifida clinic and that they are actually able to help these kids end up with their best outcome.",4,4,5,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

He tries to pretend that he's shy and is the complete opposite of that after about 30 seconds. He is Specter and he's compassionate. If I'm not feeling good or if I have a headache the next day he'll say, Mom are you feeling better? And those things stick with him. He is a self-taught gymnast so he loves doing head stands and flips and he tries to flip over the couches and jump off things and jump off stairs and so he is just a big jumper right now so we're really into that. And we love dancing so we will turn music on in the house and we'll dance away right? I am talking about you. Yeah. June 24th we went in for our ultrasound then a doctor came in and she introduced herself and she said I'm a high-risk OB so she said she wanted to take a look and that she thought our child might have what's called spina bifida. Spina bifida is one of the more common birth defects. It's the second most common birth defect that we see in the United States. It results from the spine failing to close very early in pregnancy and it is the level of the lesion or where on the back the defect is present that determines what the level of function will be for that individual child. We met with the maternal fetal medicine team and Dr. Treadwell we met her that day and then she brought up the in utero fetal surgery but we would perform that surgery when you were still pregnant. Before the procedure even happened I had kind of talked to Dr. Treadwell just to get an idea of like what to expect and I said you know is there anyone that I can talk to so I know like what's gonna happen maybe what to pack what you know what to expect once we go home and she said well actually Casey you would be the first one. The Hilton family was the first family that had the in utero spina bifida repair here at Michigan Medicine. When we talk about prenatal surgery for spina bifida what we're literally talking about is opening the woman's abdomen opening up her uterus while she's still pregnant operating on the baby while the baby is still in the uterus closing everything up and trying to continue the pregnancy for an additional 10-12 weeks. We were told originally if he walked that he would have a very hard time with it most likely would be in a wheelchair Carter does have a wheelchair it's in our garage because he doesn't really use it the fact that he is just blown everyone away and is running around our house asking us to chase him um is definitely something that I have to like remind myself hey you know I was told that this might never happen and so if he asked me to chase him around the kitchen then gosh darn it I'm gonna chase him around the kitchen.",4,4,5,3,4,4,4,5,2,2,2,4,4,4,2," 4

Explanation: The video does not explicitly describe what would happen if no treatment is used. However, it does mention that spina bifida is a birth defect that results from the spine failing to close early in pregnancy, and that the level of the lesion determines the level of function for the child. The video also discusses the in utero fetal surgery that was performed on the child, which suggests that without treatment, the child might have faced more severe consequences. Therefore, the video partially describes what would happen if no treatment is used."," 4

The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video mentions the in utero fetal surgery as a treatment choice for spina bifida, which can potentially improve the child's mobility and function. The video also shows how Carter, the child with spina bifida, is able to walk and play despite the initial prognosis that he might not be able to do so. This demonstrates the impact of the treatment choice on his overall quality of life. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different treatment options or their effects on quality of life, so it is not a complete answer."," 4

The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mainly focuses on the in utero fetal surgery for spina bifida, which is one treatment option. However, it does not explicitly mention other treatment options or alternatives."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about spina bifida and the in utero surgery, but it does not explicitly discuss shared decision-making.

0Gf6o2ZEQkc,"[Fetoscopic spina bifida repair animation] This animation shows a spina bifida repair, done prenatally, using a fetoscopic technique. In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back, with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is most commonly done between 22 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. We may use either a transverse incision, shown here . . . or a midline incision, as shown here. This animation shows a transverse incision. After we make the incision and cut through the layer of muscle, the womb is exposed. Ultrasound helps us to confirm the position of the fetus and shows us the best location to place the first port for the surgery. We then expand the amniotic cavity using humidified and heated carbon dioxide, which creates more space for us to do the repair. To enable us to see inside the womb, we insert a camera into the amniotic cavity through the first port. Two additional ports are then placed under direct vision to allow placement of instruments for the repair. We inject a cocktail of pain medication, paralytics and medication to protect the baby’s heartbeat into the gluteal muscle. We then place a stabilization stitch in the baby’s upper back, above the spina bifida. We first open up the sac all the way around the spina bifida defect. Once the sac is completely open, we free the placode, or exposed portion of the spinal cord, from the surrounding tissue. This procedure, which is called untethering, allows the placode to fall back down nicely into the spinal canal. We then raise the skin flap around the defect to loosen up the skin. This will eventually help us form a water tight closure of the spinal defect. To protect the placode, we place a patch into the defect. We anchor the patch on one end to the baby’s back using dissolvable sutures. A second patch is then placed to give additional protection, and again, it is secured with dissolvable sutures. We then close the skin over the spinal defect using dissolvable sutures, when the baby has enough skin to do so. If the defect is too large and we are not able to close the skin, we use a skin patch, forming a water tight closure. The stabilization stitch is removed. The repair is now complete. The ports are removed and the port sites are closed with dissolvable sutures. The amniotic fluid we removed is now replaced with warm fluid, and antibiotics are placed into the amniotic cavity. Finally, we close the mother’s abdominal wall muscle, and then close the skin. Ideally, the pregnancy continues until term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally if there is no contraindication.",5,4,5,4,5,4,2,2,5,4,4,5,5,5,4," 5

E080qJuHWdQ,"Every year thousands of babies are born with spina bifida. It's a birth defect where the spinal column doesn't close properly, exposing nerves to the environment. Most babies born with spina bifida in the United States have surgery soon after birth. But some children in other countries aren't so lucky. A little boy from Algeria suffered terribly for more than two years until his community helped raise money to send him to Mayo Clinic. Unbearable. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He had to live with this pain all the time. This YouTube video is not easy to watch. Munim Fershishi was born in Algiers with a severe form of spina bifida. His spinal cord did not close and his nerves that control walking and other functions pushed out into a sac of fluid called a meningocele. He could not walk or even sit. His mother Salima says her son spent the first two years of his life tilted forward on his stomach. He was in pain and doctors didn't do anything. Then the sac on Munim's back broke. He developed meningitis and slipped into a coma. His eyes were closed and he was breathing through a tube. Doctors in Algiers operated on Munim, but it did not help. Then, thanks to donations from the community, Munim was transported to Mayo Clinic. Probably the only reason the child survived, truthfully, for two years was due to the tremendous, obvious love and energy of the mother and the family. Neurosurgeon Frederick Meyer teamed up with other specialists in plastic surgery and pediatrics to customize a treatment plan for Munim. First, they cleared his body of infections. Then, Dr. Meyer opened the skin covering on Munim's spine and put the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal. Then, he closed the spinal canal and plastic surgeons closed the skin. No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery. He can move his feet, he moves his legs, he can sit down, he can eat with his own hand. Salima says Munim is without pain. He can play and laugh for the first time. Physical therapists are helping Munim get stronger and walk better than expected. Doctors aren't sure how far Munim will go with physical therapy, whether or not he'll be able to walk unassisted. But now, there's a promise of a full, productive life. He's my life. Munim is only two and a half, but he says when he grows up, he wants to be a surgeon, like Dr. Meyer.

-sU7NIB35cA,"(light music)  Finding out that your baby is less than perfect is hard, it really is. Especially that this is our third child. And we've had two healthy pregnancies, no complications whatsoever. It was really shocking for us to find out that anything was wrong. I mean, not that I would, but I didn't feel an different being pregnant, I didn't have any suspicion whatsoever. Spina bifida is so different in the way that it affects each child, so even when you're researching, you have so many possible outcomes.  It was nice that we actually had genetic counseling at that time, but to a certain regard, you kinda feel like you're on an island by yourself at that point. And we were looking for someone to really help us become grounded and know where we were gonna be going in the future.  Doctor Baschat: It's a 4D probe phase.  Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity. And that is a major advantage for life.  The idea that I also got to have a vaginal delivery was really, really important to me. My recovery was pretty easy after she was born and that made a huge difference in my ability to be there for her and for my other kids.  Doctor Miller: Because we have such a small core team who's involved in the total care of these patients, any small change, we can observe immediately.  We have regular followup appointments with a lot of doctors, but that's okay. We see neurosurgery every three months, just to keep checking on things and making sure things are going well.

_FZntuo_W20,"Hello friends, I am Dr. Anurag Saxena, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon and Spine Surgeon at Naranath Superspecialty Hospital, Gurgaon. Today we are going to talk to you regarding Spina Bifida. Spina Bifida is a condition which refers to a developmental defect in the spinal column of the child which means that there are certain areas of the spine of the child, bony spine and neural spine which are not able to form during the development of the child as a fetus. This leads to a defect in the back, it is usually more common in the lower side of the back but this can happen at the other extremity that is in the cervical region or the back of the head also. And this defect leads to a swelling which is called as cystic swelling or meningosil, myosil and sometimes there can be fatty tissues in it and it is called as a lipoma. So broadly Spina Bifida can be divided into two categories, one is called as a Spina Bifida Occulta which means occult or hidden which means that the defect you cannot see from outside and there is a covering of a skin or a fatty tissue over the defect and the other category is called as Spina Bifida Apperta or where it is apparent or where you can see it when there is a defect which is visible or there is a big swelling of a fluid containing sac which is available. The fluid containing sac can be meningosil and myosil which we are going to describe further in this video. We need to know exactly how it happens is it happens because the spine closes like a zip of a cloth when the patient, when the baby is in the womb and during the development this zip like closure of the spinal cord or your spine is sometimes hampered at either end of the spine that is in the upper end or the lower end and this leads to a defect which remains and in this defect certain tissues goes in from like body fat and muscles can go in and sometimes the neural tissues which forms a tube are not able to form a tube and sometimes there can be absence or inactive neural tissues inside this kind of swelling which leads to spina bifida problems. What exactly causes this kind of problems is not known however there is a clear association with deficiency of a vitamin called as folic acid in mothers especially at the time of conception and during the first trimester of the pregnancy. Other causative agents include certain type of drugs and genetic factors also. So if there is a family history, if somebody in the family is suffering from this kind of disease then the chances of one having baby with spina bifida increases as compared to general population. So when the cystic swelling contains only the fluid or the CSF or the cerebrospinal fluid then it is called as a meningosy. When this cavity contains fluid and the neural tissues which can include the spinal cord or nerves then it is called as a meningomyelosy. Because it is a developmental defect then sometimes the babies can have associated developmental problem in the brain like building up of the fluid which is called as hydrocephalus and sometimes they can have problems in their lower feet like club foot. Very rarely these kind of babies can have developmental problem in other organs of the body like heart and gastrointestinal organs. So apart from the swelling in the back or anywhere in the back like from your cervical spine to lower spine, most of the time in the lower spine this swelling is apparent and these patients usually have weakness or less movement of the legs and their control of their urine and bowels is also hampered. Now there are series of diagnostic tests which can be applied before birth. They are called as antinatal diagnostic tests and then there are after the baby is born then there are certain diagnostic modalities like MRI and the treatment largely depends on the type of the spinal bifida. The diagnosis and the treatment will be covered in the next part of this video. Thank you.",4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,3," 4

EU3C20Myax4,"Spina Bifida is a major malformation where the bone of the spine will not cover the posterior part of the nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and the skin on top of this will not close properly as well. This will result in an uncoordinated and disordered development of the nerves into the lower limbs with a afinalistic innervation of the different muscles. It normally consists in a full palsy of the muscles and sometimes in some spasticity of the residual part of those. It is probably due to a lack of folic acid during pregnancy that will not allow the meninges to develop properly. Spina Bifida can have different degrees of malformation, it can also be Spina Bifida Occulta when is not present clinically at birth But some malformation of the vertebrae involved of the spine are present. Treatment of the Spina Bifida includes physiotherapy more frequently but sometimes you need surgery to correct progressive deformity- Life expectancy of Spina Bifida is quite long unless some complication will shorten it like hydrocephalus, infection of the derivation and chest infection or general diseases that can decrease life length. Surgical treatment is mostly orthopedics. Only at birth you need surgical closure of the bony and nerval part of the posterior spine but in the rest of the life hip dysplasia and dislocation deformity of the knee the ankle and the feet will normally touch every patients and they will undergo major surgery for more than once in their life. In my department you need latex free and we have surgical theaters, because they are allergic to latex so patients with spina bifida need a special preparation of the operating room with special instrument. We have a referral center for spina bifida and cerebral palsy in Milan where we perform for spina bifida at least 120 operation per year.

RlkrW3AW0ZU,"Open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect the spine and spinal cord. Myelomeningocele, or MMC and Myeloschisis are both serious forms of spina bifida and occur when a baby’s spine, spinal cord and spinal canal don’t close as they normally would. Spina bifida occurs in the first three to four weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when the spinal cord is forming. At this point, a baby’s developing brain and spine are referred to as the “neural tube.” Normally, during these first few weeks of development, the two sides of a baby's back fold to form a tube called the spinal cord. If a baby has an open neural tube defect, the neural tube doesn’t close completely, leaving a small gap. This is the defect. With an open neural tube defect such as MMC, the bones of the spine don’t completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. Because the spinal canal remains open, the spinal cord and meninges protrude from the baby’s back. Babies with MMC-type spina bifida can have a sac protruding from the opening in the spine. This sac may contain: cerebrospinal fluid, nerves, and parts of the spinal cord. At the Colorado Fetal Care Center, MMC is surgically repaired in utero with either an open procedure or the newly developed fetoscopic surgery. During open surgery, an anesthesiologist will put the mother to sleep in order to relax the uterus. The anesthesia passes through the placenta to the unborn child. Then, incisions are made in the abdomen to open the mother’s belly and uterus. The baby’s spine and defect are then exposed. From there, the defect is repaired and the skin of the baby’s back is closed over the opening to protect their still-developing neural tissue. Following open surgery, the baby will be delivered via c- section. The fetoscopic surgery involves opening up the mother’s belly like during the open surgery, but instead of cutting into the uterus, tiny incisions are made and instruments are inserted to access the baby and repair the defect. Following fetoscopic surgery, the baby can be delivered vaginally. The Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation. Here, you will have individualized care with experts who have spent years researching, innovating and performing repairs of spina bifida.

Of protecting like because it had flat feet for 28 years Almost like a structural growth there to as like a, what's the word? It is a type of progression. Ahhhh Okay I will show you the proper way Okay Okay You are doing bodybuilding? I am doing two years of competition. Ahh But I am competing for the best. Ahh Okay So I am going to do it in a car. Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay You are very quiet this time. I am trying to be able to do it. I am trying to do it in a car. Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Wow Okay Okay Okay That is all. I will show you guys what my foot looks like at home. Thank you guys so much. If you guys want to see me do more treatments because I am going to have to do leave the video the thumbs up. I would really appreciate it. And if you are new subscribe. But I will leave it there. I will see you in the next one. Peace. Did you get that pain that you were complaining about? Yes I did. Yes like that back pain. My lower back and my feet. But I am very worried especially what he said about my the nodules in my feet. Especially where the arch is supposed to be. So hopefully it is something I need to look into and probably going to come for a few more times and get the soles for my shoes. Awesome.",2,2,2,1,2,2,2,4,2,2,1,2,2,2,1," 2

So what exactly we're gonna be doing Okay, first part of the treatment will be my special release of the thick fibrous tissue called the plantar fascia Which runs from the hill to the toes? So how are we gonna fix that through the myofascial release to release that tension in that tissue and the second part? We're gonna look at exercises of the foot core muscles, which will be guided by max. I Am so scared. You should Gently give it a thumbs up my pain. I know it's about to be bad I So this arch is completely sort of collapse Yeah as well as what can explain yeah, so I mean you can just feel how tight it is already I mean, I'm literally doing this for I am fear So we're just gonna warm it up for this day and then we're gonna we're gonna get into okay you look a bit scared I'm so worried.

-Ot-dP1xST4,"Up-right sprinting, one of the biggest common mistakes during upright sprinting is for the athletes to be tosey. This is what Jene calls it and I really agree. Landing on the toes or landing only on the ball of the foot. We want to land flat-footed, meaning getting that door side flex movement with the foot before you hit the ground. Heel barely misses the ground, she's landing flat. So our way of fixing it, as we talked about, our philosophy is to use forced mechanics drills versus only talking about things. She's going to give me A-skips, a two-stroke movement up to the Z down, but now you're going to land on your heel. So can you just get your foot up, hit your heel a little bit, just get some kinesthetic awareness to remind yourself of the part of the foot that will be hitting the ground. This is very safe and very appropriate. So come up to the Z, land on the heel, very controlled, just feel landing on the heel. Go ahead. Just a regular A-skip. On the heel, on the heel, the part that you hit. Now we're really teaching the door side flex movement and getting her to land on the heel to really get her toes up. A little exaggeration to make sure that she's getting the constant. You're going to turn around. Now I want you to hit your heels one more time just to remind yourself, this is the contact of the point to the ground. You're going to give me B-skips, landing on the heel. Before you go, can you get your toe up, just get your foot up, dangle your toe down. Now her foot coming to the ground, now her leg is so long, we want to make sure that the leg is short so it can swing quicker to the ground because the faster it comes down to the ground, the more force you get out of the ground, the more productive you'll be during the air mechanics, the flight phase of the sprinting. In baseball, if you have a hitter that's swinging the bat and they're slow, what they do in baseball, they bring them a shorter bat to be able to swing quicker. In sprinting, a longer foot, a longer leg will swing slow, produces less force, thus sprint slower. Now we want to make sure that that foot, that leg is shorter by getting door side flexion and make sure that we're landing flat-footed to take advantage of her powerful calf muscles. So give us B-skips, landing on the heel. Calfs close to the hamster on the way up, then land on the heel. Take a break, walk back here. Great job. If you want to just come back here. Now recovery mechanics in upright sprinting, just get the calf close to the hamster, get up to the Z. Yep. One more time. From the ground, pull it forward to calf to hamstring. Bam. This is what we're looking for in recovery mechanics. It makes her leg shorter, thus can swing up faster. Thus, she'll be faster. If that angle is too open, looking not like a Z, like an L, that's a capital L for me. That's a uppercase L. That's a longer lever will make the thigh swing slower coming up. This is not what we're looking for. We want to come up quick, calf to hamster to the Z, then push directly down. Do it again. Come up, push directly down. This is what we're looking for. We're going to add one little thing. We're going to do A skips on the heel, stretching your arms up. If the athletes are slacky, if they're broken at the hips, they're basically losing a lot of force. It's as if you're trying to shoot a cannon out of a canoe. Your force is going all over the place. We want to have a stable posture because this is our platform to apply force. Stick your arms up there, making sure that she's tall at the hips, knees, and ankles. Come up to the Z and land, just A skip movement, land on the heel. Go ahead. Stay tall and land on the heel. Stay in tall and land in a dorsiflexion, getting the heel close to the butt and the way up to make sure that we have a shorter lever at recovery, which will make it faster. Now we're going to do B skips, stretching the arm up, making sure that we're stiff and tall so not wasting force. Land on the heel as well. Stretch your arm up. Calf close to the hamster on the way up, shorter recovery, and land on the heel. Great dorsiflexion, great tall body, stable body posture. Now we're really efficient in applying our force.",4,4,4,3,4,4,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2," 4

sf_Q9NSiPvk,"The procedure is started by making an L-shaped skin incision on the lateral side of the heel to expose the calcaneus, the heel bone. This incision is used to protect nerves and tissues, which will allow for optimal scar healing. A saw template is used to make an accurate cut through the calcaneus bone. The template is secured to the bone by lightly tapping the pins in the template with a mallet. A saw is then used to make a precise cut through the bone. Once the cut has been made, the saw template is removed. The template will leave two perfectly sized holes for placement of guide pins. The calcaneal step plate is secured with two locking drill guide towers and then placed over these guide pins. One of the pins is removed and a drill is placed through the tower for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the first screw. The drill guide is removed and the first screw is securely locked into place. This step is repeated for the second screw placement. Following placement of the second screw, the drill guides are then attached to the next available slots in the plate and used to push the cut portion of the heel towards the internal side of the heel. An S-shaped guide can also be used to assist the surgeon in pushing the heel into an accurate position. While maintaining this position, the surgeon will then place a drill guide through a slot in the plate, which will allow the surgeon to compress the plate with a screw into a secure and accurate position. Once the compression screw has been placed, the surgeon will then proceed to use the drill guide towers for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the remaining screws, to secure the plate into its final locked position against the heel bone. The surgeon will then repair the L-shaped incision with great care. This Calcania step plate was designed with a low profile so the patient should not feel any screws or hardware that have been secured into the bone. It can also be used in pediatric populations.",4,4,4,4,5,4,2,2,5,4,4,1,2,4,2," 4

1LogN1M_dyY,"- Hey, have you struggled to fix your flat feet all your life? Well, today I'm gonna show you how I went from this, to this. (bright music) - Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health, where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do it yourself programs. The exercise in question is the arch raise. I'm gonna show you how to do it, and then I'm gonna explain to you why it's proper execution is crucial to fixing your flat feet. To perform this exercise, you've got three key points. Number one is, as you lift yourself off the floor, like so, you're trying to move your Achilles tendon out this way, so it's like you're trying to roll your ankle out this way as you lift your foot. Key point number two is, as you roll your ankle out, you're trying to keep the big toe mound on the floor, as much as possible, so you've got your ankle rolling out one way, and you've got your forefoot rolling in the other way. That's two key points so far. The third key point is, as you come up on your heels, try not to grip the floor with your toes. Your toes will be somewhat active, but they shouldn't be trying to scrunch the ground like this as you lift your heel, because that will get in the way of getting that pure big toe mound bend that is essential to this exercise. To understand how this exercise helps, let's review the conditions of success of a strong and staple foot. Among those conditions are, a vertical Achilles tendon when seen from behind the ankle, and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then your Achilles tendon when seen from behind is probably going to be angled inward, and in this exercise, we're training your ability to roll your ankle out, moving that Achilles tendon from that inward pointing position to an outward pointing position. Outwards, so that you now have the range to get it right back in the center when you need it to be there. But if that's all you have, if you're only able to roll your ankle out to get your Achilles tendon to be vertical, without changing the rest of your foot, then you've got this big toe mound that's off the floor, and that's not a very stable foot either. That's where the second key point of this exercise comes in, which is intend to press the big toe mound onto the floor, even as you are rolling your ankle outwards. What this does is it reinforces your ability to create that foot tripod position while you maintain a vertical Achilles tendon. Lastly, the third key point, you need to be able to keep your toes relatively relaxed compared to what the rest of your foot is doing, because if your toes are stuck in this death grip mode, then, when you raise your heel off the floor, you're not gonna be able to keep your big toe mound pushing into the floor. Your toes need to relax in order for you to get that big toe mound pressing into the floor, creating that foot tripod that we want. Now that you understand the three key points of this exercise, and the why behind them, if you're having trouble performing this exercise exactly the way that I'm showing it to you, then feel free to modify this exercise. For example, if you're having trouble staying balanced, and that's really throwing off your ability to get at three key points, then maybe stand at a wall, maybe hold onto a stick as you're performing it, maybe take a wider stance, do what you need to do to get the three key points. Now, you may be wondering, ""How many sets, how many reps of this exercise should I do?"" The answer to that is it depends. What does it depend on? Depends on what does it take for you to be able to get a training effect from this exercise. That means if this is your first day, and you really need to slow down your reps to feel the right stuff happening, and you're only able to get five total reps because of that, that's totally fine, do five super, super, super slow reps. Do what you need to do to feel like something has changed after you've done the exercise. Perhaps in a month, after you're more used to this exercise and you're just using it for your warmups, for maybe after your lifting sessions, and you're able to pump out, let's say 30 reps, and they're all pretty quick, and you like it that way, and you feel like that gives you a training effect as opposed to the five super slow reps that you started with, then do that. The principle here is do what you need to do to get a training effect from this exercise. That does it for this exercise.

k2HKIN1iuFA,being on your toes or being flat-footed which one is better which one should you be doing on this video i'm going to give you the pros and cons of both of them so you know which one you should be doing and when you should be doing it because there's a lot of benefits to both of them and there's a lot of negatives to both of them as well my name is tony jeffries olympic bronze medalist former undefeated professional seven times national champion european champion welcome to my youtube channel big thank you to sam kirkdale for requesting this video in the comments below guys if you've got any video requests you want me to make please let me know in the comments below i'll be reading them all so should you be on your toes should you be flat-footed it's funny because when i turned professional after having a very successful amateur career where i was on my toes a lot everyone told us tony you need to slow down you need to plant your feet and throw them punches but a lot of them people were wrong and i'm going to tell you exactly why first thing i'm going to break down is flat-footed the pros and cons of being flat-footed so the biggest pro of being flat-footed is you can generate more power in your punches so when i'm here i'm flat-footed and as you can see i'm generating a lot of power right there as long as you're turning your hips and fully extending exhaling doing all the right things you can generate so much power when you've got your feet planted here then also your balance is better when you're flat-footed compared to being up on your toes you're flat-footed you can throw my balance is really good there throwing these longer combinations guys i've done a full video on how to keep your balance when throwing long combinations you can check that one out after here and yes balance is very important once you've got your feet planted you get really good balance and kind of following on with your balance is you can work better inside when your feet is planted so i'm inside so now because these feet are planted that can work great inside and another massive benefit of being flat-footed is you're saving more energy if you're walking around the ring like this you know you're not using much energy at all so you can save a lot more energy so let me tell you about the cons of being flat-footed the first one is your punches from the outside are generally slower because you're flat-footed yeah your punches are going to be slower and then for me the worst thing about being flat-footed is you're relying on head moving and reactions for defense you'll be inside and the only way you can really defend is by you moving your head blocking here taking the punches here if you're not moving your feet to defend it's very risky because that means you're always in range to get hit now on your toes the pros and cons of being on your toes the number one is you've got better defense if you're on your toes you can defend better and footwork is by far the best defense that you can do because if you think about it if i'm here and someone throws a punch and i step back i've got out the way the punch but if they if the punch is coming and it is landing and i'm stepping at the same time it's going to take the sting out of the punch so footwork defense is the best sort of defense you can do so when i'm on my toes i'm gonna be in and out defending always ready for that punch coming back and getting out the way of it also a big massive pro for this is you can punch faster yes you can punch faster when you're on your toes i've done a video on how they instantly punch faster check that out and one of the things that i talk about is moving in and out with your feet when i'm moving in and out with my feet i punch faster and Manny Pacquiao was an absolute master at doing this he would step and punch at the same time and that's how he generated so much hand speed another thing it looks better you look like a better fighter when you're here on your toes compared to here plodding forward you know this doesn't really look very good but if you're on your toes that looks way better but for me the big one is the defense moving in and out keeping your opponent thinking and this is why i prefer to be on my toes compared to being flat footed and there is a time and a place for both but now let's get on to the cons of being on your toes the biggest one is it uses more energy but what one of my old amateur boxing trainers David Binns who was an amazing coach he still is amazing coach used to tell us was if you can box on your toes and box like that for four two minute rounds you can do it for 12 three minute rounds all it comes down to is conditioning now if you look at someone like Muhammad Ali in his early days he was a master at moving around on his toes so that kind of dismisses that con about using more energy even though it does you've just got to condition yourself to be able to do it for longer now another con is that your punches is not going to be as hard but when you mix it up on your toes with plant in your feet you can still punch hard that's why you should master both of them being on your toes and being flat footed and then the other con i guess is balance you know you you might be losing your balance when you're moving around trying to throw these punches but when you practice this you're only going to get better at it and you're never going to lose your balance so which one should you be practicing guys before i tell you this please if you haven't already subscribed this channel hit that bell notification to get notified every time i upload a boxing education video like this one also give me a like any comments below i'll be reading them all so you should be practicing both a bit of both i would advise practicing more on your toes because it's harder to box on your toes like this than it is flat footed so once you master moving in and out being on your toes working on them fast punches all of the pros that i said about being on your toes then you can work on being flat footed but i believe so much that working on your footwork is very important footwork is the most important thing in boxing without your feet underneath you you're going to be probably useless everywhere else there's not many great fighters who didn't have great footwork

GPS10HfgYDY,"Flat feet are typically caused by a bone inside the foot that is hypermobile and comes out of alignment. It's called the talus bone. And if you can use the analogy of a stone bridge, that if you have stones that come up to the center of the bridge, and you pluck out that middle stone, then the bridge collapses. Well, essentially, in the foot, the talus bone, which is inside the ankle joint, acts like that stone bridge and that center stone. And typically what happens with a flat foot is that the talus bone migrates forward on ambulation. So when a person steps down and puts their full weight, the talus moves forward like this, which then causes the midfoot to unlock. And then you have a flat foot. Now, we do have treatments for this condition. And typically you do want to treat a flat foot because if you don't, there can be issues with ankle pain, with knee pain, hip pain, and back pain. Because if you can imagine your base is out of alignment, then the rest of your joints can become out of alignment. Which our thought is that this can cause arthritis at a premature age and various kinds of joint pains up the extremity, up the kinetic chain.

That's pretty severe. - [Bob] Yeah. - Okay. And if that's happening with you you probably have some special shoes if you're going that flat. Okay. So that's what we're calling flat foot or pronation in the therapy world. - [Bob] Right. - Okay. So what happens is the tissues underneath here, the plantar, the bottom tissues when your foot splays out, they get stretched. And over time they can continue to stretch, stretch stretch. And like I said, get that navicular bone right down to the tape right down to the floor which is not what you want. So some supportive shoes which I'll talk about in a little bit, the next thing if we go up to the knee, what happens to the mechanics of the leg when that foot pronates and flattens out the tibia rotates this direction this way. So look at the red tape right there. It goes in and we got a little rotation there and that can throw the mechanics of the knee off slightly. Therefore you can, you know, get some arthritis arthritic changes prematurely in the knee, Bob. - [Bob] It's amazing how the slightest little change there can affect this and that can affect pain - Yep, and create problems along the way But wait, Bob, there's more. - [Bob] Yes, there is more - Okay. That in turn rotates the tibia and look at the knee. it also puts a stress on the MCL, the ligament here. And you get that bowling - Your collateral ligament, - Knock knees. - Yeah. So you can see both knees are starting to get knock kneed because I'm flat foot. And you see that quite often on people, Brad they're walking along and I can see their they're flat feet are causing them to be knock kneed. - Right. It's going right up the chain. And then even up into the hip, the femur will rotate in and that can put some stress on the posterior muscles on the back side of the hip and into the the joint itself. Again can cause problems as we age prematurely as if you, you know, if you didn't have. - It's like a little hole in the dam, isn't it. - Right. So what's a easy way to correct this. We do have a video with some exercises that can help this. - Sure. - But you know, the, the probably the better way is to get the proper pair of footwear for this. And you can do this without getting custom footwear for five or $600, depending on the severity of your case. But let me get a shoe here. And if you go and you're gonna ask for to a good shoe store and say, I need a pair of shoe for flat footed people or technically they called motion control shoes. If you say the term motion control, - I'll put the word down below Brad, - Any good salesperson should know exactly what you're talking about. And this is not a motion control shoe but on a motion control shoe you're gonna notice a very thick, sole right through here you're not gonna have this end in here. It's all the way across. It's very thick and it's, it's that way. So support so that when your foot flattens it supports it. - Right. - And, and if you do this to motion control shoe you will not have this bend. It'll be like, almost like a board and just a tip bend a little bit. - Sure. Very, very stiff. - They're gonna be about 150 bucks or so dependent on what you get, so buy 'em on sale. If you're like me and that's, that's it. - Yeah. That'll help control the problems going all the way up the. - Yeah. But even if you get these motion control shoes it's not gonna do anything for that broken heart, Bob. - That's right. We can fix just about anything but we can't fix broken heart. Darn. - What do you say to that Leopold? - I sure hope we can figure, figure that out sometimes. So thanks.",4,4,4,3,4,2,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,4," 4

SEocnyAGcFg,"The Arthrex internal brace spring ligament augmentation repair is a surgery for people who have flat foot due to weakness or rupture of the spring ligament or posterior tibial tendon. Spring ligament is the connecting tissue located under the foot that connects the calcaneus and the vicular bone. This ligament is often repaired in people that have a condition called flat foot. It is when the arch of the foot collapses, coming into contact with the ground. The repair begins with the surgeon making a cut on the side of the ankle where the calcaneus, vicular bone, and medial cuneiform are located. Next, the surgeon will create a bone tunnel by drilling into the sesentaculum tali of the calcaneus using a guide wire and drill guide. The bone tunnel is made in the calcaneus to prepare for a Swiveloc suture anchor loaded with fiber tape. The Swiveloc anchor is screwed into place. Next, the FDL tendon, also known as flexor digitorum longus, located on the medial side of the leg is identified, cut, and then tagged with a fiber loop stitching technique. A bone tunnel is made in the navicular to prepare for an additional Swiveloc anchor. The ankle structures are tensioned and fixed into place by taking one part of the fiber tape and passing it from top to bottom with a suture passing wire. Then, take the other part of the fiber tape with the sutures from the FDL tendon and passing it from bottom to top. The surgeon then holds it in place by inserting the Swiveloc from bottom to top. The remaining sutures are cut. The supporting structures of the arch of the foot are now repaired and held together with the internal brace, causing the arch of the foot to be restored.",4,4,4,3,4,4,2,2,5,4,3,2,4,4,2," 4

lZ22SfQVKRg,"Flat feet is when the arch of the foot comes in contact with the ground. This can be a normal condition. The causes for flat feet can be congenital, in that you're born with it, or acquired, which develops with age. Acquired flat feet typically occurs secondary to wear and tear on the tendon on the inside of your foot called the posterior tibial tendon. Through repetitive trauma or acute trauma, this tendon can weaken and the arch can lower. Flat feet may not hurt. Some people just have flat feet, and it may not be a problem all their lives. However, there are quite a few conditions that are associated with flat feet. The development of bunions and hammertoes is common with people with flat feet.

Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects. First, the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is not definitively confirmed, as the doctor only observes pain on the bottom of Griffin's foot and some foot collapse. Second, the taping method is not a permanent solution and may not work for everyone, as it depends on the individual's arch structure and muscle function. Third, the long-term effects of the taping are not discussed, as the doctor only mentions that Griffin will need to continue strengthening his foot muscles. Therefore, the video partially addresses areas of uncertainty."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment works. It explains the process of taping the foot for plantar fasciitis and how it supports the arch. However, it does not provide a clear explanation of why the taping works or how it helps in relieving the pain.

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of the treatment. It only shows the process of taping the foot for plantar fasciitis and how it can provide temporary relief. The video does not mention any potential side effects, complications, or contraindications for the taping method."," 2

The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only shows a taping method to provide temporary relief for plantar fasciitis. The video does not mention any long-term consequences or the natural progression of the condition without treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It shows a specific taping method for plantar fasciitis that can provide temporary relief and support for the arch. However, it does not discuss other treatment options or how the taping method compares to other choices in terms of effectiveness or long-term outcomes."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor explains that the taping method they are using is temporary and not a permanent solution, and that there are other muscles and arches in the foot that could be involved in treating plantar fasciitis. The doctor also mentions that the patient will still need to do some strengthening exercises. This indicates that there are other possible treatment choices beyond the taping method demonstrated in the video."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some information about plantar fasciitis and how to tape the foot for support, but it does not involve the patient in the decision-making process.

r0o-RBA6ygc,"Music We're watching Lorelei here in slow motion. Please pay attention to not only her knees, but her ankles and her feet. Most people when they come in to complain state that the ankles are turning inward. When the reality is it's actually the talus bone within the ankle that is going down and inward. Here we see her walking at normal speed. Notice the toes also trying to help out. And the just complete collapse of her arch and where her ankles are. We're going to see shortly what she looks like after reconstruction and correction. Here you really see how devastating this flat foot is. This is also very mentally challenging for patients, especially women. Now this is her after she had her right side done. About four months after surgery. You can see the comparison between the right and the left. She's still not walking quite normally yet because of the imbalance of only having one foot corrected. But there's a pretty stark difference between both. Now you'll see the amazing transformation that Lorelei underwent having these procedures done. And now that her muscles have acclimated to the new position. Her knees are in better position. Her gait is significantly improved. She can function now. This truly was a remarkable transformation for Lorelei both mentally and physically. You're now going to hear from Lorelei who's a bit on the shy side. But I think you'll see one happy patient despite going through what she did. Which ultimately will give her happy and healthy feet and legs for the rest of her life. I would encourage you to go back and look through the previous video to really see and compare the before and afters. Thank you. We're over a year out since your flat foot reconstruction on both feet, correct? And I just wanted to ask you one question. If this surgery changed your life, if so, how did it from before you had surgery to now? It changed my life a lot because before I was having a lot of pain and it hurt to walk and run. And now it's not such a bad problem. It's getting better. And how about from just the mental aspect of it for you? By that I mean, you know, when you had those really flat feet, were you depressed about it? Were you unhappy? Did you notice it? I mean, now that you have feet that are not flat anymore, is there any difference there? I noticed it when I wore shoes that the shoes would cave in on the inside and I didn't like that. Okay. I don't know. That upset me. Okay. And is that happening anymore? No. No. So your shoes are not breaking down on you? Yeah. Okay. And so for anyone with flat feet like yours, you would say this is definitely something they should do? Yeah. I understand that when you were doing cheerleading, that when you would take your shoes off, some of the kids would make fun of you. Is that true? Yes. I'm sure that didn't go over so well.

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video aims to show the transformation of a patient with flat feet before and after surgery, and how it improved her physical and mental well-being. However, the video lacks a clear introduction and a specific focus on the surgical procedure or the benefits of correcting flat feet. The transcript also includes some irrelevant information, such as the patient's experience with cheerleading and the comments from other kids."," 5

Explanation: The video achieves its aims because it demonstrates a clear before and after comparison of Lorelei's condition, showing the significant improvement in her gait, knee position, and overall quality of life after the surgery. The video also includes Lorelei's personal testimony, which adds credibility to the results. The video is informative and engaging, making it effective in conveying the benefits of the procedure."," 4

jzJZRl4tN4M,"You've probably heard the term flatfoot or pes planus. I'm sure you've even heard some of your friends or colleagues discussing the flatfoot as well. And I'm sure there's a few of you out there who've been diagnosed with having a flatfoot. As a podiatrist, it's one of the questions that I most often get asked. Do I have a flatfoot? My name is Gerard. I'm a podiatrist here at Singapore General Hospital. Let me tell you a little bit more about flatfoot. Flatfoot is a common condition that affects the Asian population. Estimates suggest it occurs one in every five individuals. To identify someone with flat feet, you need to observe the way a person stands or walks. During standing or walking, those with flat feet tend to flatten their inner foot or arch. Furthermore, the foot may roll over to the inner side. However, for children under the ages of 10 who may not have fully developed foot arches, assessing whether a child has flatfoot can be difficult. There are a number of contributing factors for flat feet. Often hereditary causes may contribute to having certain tight or weak muscles or even ligament laxity. Also, poor footwear can play a major role in causing flat feet. For example, wearing shoes that limit toe movements such as high heels when young can lead to flat feet in adulthood. Having a flat foot does not necessarily increase the incidence of injury, nor does it usually cause a problem. However, flat feet may put a strain on your muscles, ligaments and joints, which can cause pain in your feet, legs, hips and back when you stand or walk. Furthermore, individuals with flat feet tend to develop tired or aching feet after prolonged periods of walking or standing. Treatment is only required if the flat foot causes pain in the foot or lower limb. Besides treatment, there are exercises you can do to improve your flat foot condition. It is important to perform these exercises in a safe and comfortable position. Stop immediately and inform your podiatrist if you experience any pain. To ensure your safety is maintained during exercise, pick an appropriate time to do the exercises. Be well rested and ensure your symptoms are well controlled by your medication. Exercise at your own pace. Avoid jerking or bouncing, instead maintain a comfortable and sustained stretch. Perform these exercises several times at one go and do them repeatedly throughout the day. Sit barefoot in a chair and place a small hand towel on the floor in front of you. Place the ball of your foot on the edge of the towel and reaching out with your toes as far as you can, grab the towel and scrunch it back towards you, bunching it under your foot. Keep reaching out and grabbing more towel until you run out. Repeat on the other foot. Stand on a step with only the ball of your foot on the board and the rest of your heel and foot hanging slightly below the toes. Start with your foot in a neutral position and raise up to your tiptoes by pressing down with your toes. When you lower, resist the urge to drop to your heel too far below the stair line. Do three sets of stair raises ten times per set. Stretching your calf muscles can help loosen tight calf muscles that contributes to a flat foot. To stretch your calf and Achilles tendon, sit on the floor with your legs fully extended in an L shaped position and your toes pointing upwards. Place a towel or TheraBand over your forefoot and hold. Pull it towards you. You should feel the stretch at the back of your left leg below the knee. Hold the stretch for twenty to thirty seconds and repeat with the opposite leg. Repeat the stretch three times on each leg and do this exercise three to four times daily. Start with your foot. Place flat on the floor. Try raising all ten toes upwards. Hold for five seconds. Then relax and repeat ten times. Hip weakness can contribute to flat feet so it's also important to strengthen the muscles that control the outward movement of the leg. This helps to ensure that the joints of the leg stay in proper alignment. One such exercise is side lying leg raises. Begin by lying on your side with one arm bent and resting under your head. Keep both legs straight with your bottom leg touching the ground while raising your top leg one feet above your bottom leg. Hold for two seconds then return the leg to the ground to complete one rep. Perform a total of ten reps three times a day. Don't let flat feet ruin your quality of life. Get treatment today and do the exercises regularly. Start today and you can be pain free from flat foot.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,4," 4

u7kBYZTtsls,"We're now watching Lorelei walk through the We're now watching Lorelei walk in my office and you can see the severe deformity in both feet with complete collapse of the arch, eversion or valgus of the heels, and the outward position of the forefoot. For lack of a better terminology, she's walking like a duck or Charlie Chaplin. And you can see the gross deformity here. She's not able to function very well and this is a poorly functioning foot. Participating in any sporting activity is almost impossible, yet she has been a real trooper and trying to persevere. And she was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of this problem. And as you can see, that's not the case. We're now going to see the post-operative results on the right here. You can see the straight line that I drew showing the new position of the foot. Again, here we're looking on your left side, which is the right foot. We're seeing a much straighter foot with a restoration of the arch. Again, we're seeing the arch on the right foot, which is pretty dramatic, relative to the left side, which shows here no arch and a completely collapsed foot, which is not functional at all. In this picture, we're looking at the titanium calcaneal graft that was put in here to lengthen the lateral column and help restore the arch. And now we're looking at the top of the foot where a similar graft was placed into the menial cuneiform to help bring the arch more prominent. This is the preoperative x-ray where you'll note the lines that I've drawn that help indicate the deformity. Looking at the red line below in the blue, and now we can see that little blue line near the implant is now elevated along with the arch. And we can see all the implants in the foot that brought the arch up. This is the before picture where you see the foot is completely turning outward and the proximal portion is going inward. And this is the postoperative result, which is very dramatic. You can see the foot is perfectly straight now and looks much better as it did in the video. Here we're looking at her walk now three months out, which has just only been walking now for a couple of weeks, and already it's dramatic the improvement. Again now we'll look at the x-ray preoperatively and postoperatively next to each other and you can see the dramatic improvement.

For example, the speaker mentions that the patient was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of the problem, but this did not happen. This uncertainty is not fully resolved by the surgery, as the speaker still needs to explain the reasons behind the failure of the initial prediction and the success of the surgery. Additionally, the long-term outcomes of the surgery are not discussed, leaving some uncertainty about the patient's future function and well-being."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe how each treatment works. The narrator explains the pre-operative condition, the surgical procedures performed (titanium calcaneal graft and menial cuneiform graft), and the post-operative results. However, the video does not provide a detailed explanation of the rationale behind the treatments or the specific steps taken during the surgery."," 4

Explanation: The video does describe some benefits of the treatment, such as the restoration of the arch, improved function, and the ability to participate in sports. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the benefits of the treatment versus not treating the condition or other possible treatments. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video does describe the risks of each treatment, but it is not very detailed. The risks are mentioned in the context of the patient's experience and the improvements seen after the surgery. The video shows the severe deformity before the surgery and the dramatic improvement after the surgery, but it does not explicitly discuss the risks of the surgery or any alternative treatments."," 5

The video does describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The transcript shows the severe deformity in both feet, the complete collapse of the arch, eversion or valgus of the heels, and the outward position of the forefoot. It also mentions that the patient is not able to function very well and participate in any sporting activity. The video then shows the post-operative results, which demonstrate a significant improvement in the foot's function and appearance. The transcript and video together provide a clear illustration of the consequences of untreated foot deformity."," 5

Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The patient's severe foot deformity made it difficult for her to function and participate in sports. The video shows the dramatic improvement in her foot function and quality of life after the surgery, which included implants to lengthen the lateral column and restore the arch. The patient's postoperative walk demonstrates the successful outcome of the treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The transcript mentions a specific surgical procedure that was performed on the patient, but it does not explicitly state that this is the only treatment option available. The surgeon describes the surgery in detail, but also acknowledges that the patient was initially told by pediatricians that she would grow out of the problem, implying that other non-surgical options may have been considered or tried before resorting to surgery. Additionally, the surgeon does not explicitly state that this surgery is the best or only option for treating the patient's condition. Therefore, the video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as it shows the patient's condition before and after surgery, and the improvements in her foot function. However, it does not provide any information about alternative treatments or options, nor does it involve the patient or her family in the discussion of the surgery or its outcomes. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'",set(),134
BuQdGkBXJOk,"Hey, have you tried a bunch of stretches to try to fix your flat feet but nothing seems to work? Well, today I'm going to show you one key stretch that I use to go from this to this. Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do-it-yourself programs. So the stretch in question is the hero pose. I'm going to show you how to do it. I'm going to show you some modifications you can try to optimize it for your body. Then I'm going to explain to you why its proper execution is crucial to improving your flat feet. So to set up for this pose, I'm going to start in tall kneeling position with my heels slightly outside of my knees and my toes pointing inward. Next, I'm going to get onto my hands and knees and slowly rock my butt back towards my heels. My butt should be landing inside of my heels so that my heels will eventually be touching the outside of my butt when I get all the way down. And my toes should still be pointing inward as I get into the full pose. Once I'm in the full pose, I'm going to aim to lengthen my spine so that when seen from the side I've got that nice neutral spine shape. I can do some anterior and posterior pelvic tilts going back and forth between the extremes to find what feels neutral, to find the zone where my sit bones feel like they're directly underneath of the rest of my spine. And from there, I'm going to try to relax as much as I can as I feel this super intense stretch around my shins and the top of my ankles. So for this stretch, I like to stay in it for as long as it takes to feel something change. That may take two minutes, it may take five minutes, it may take ten minutes. For example, when I first get into this stretch, I may not feel anything stretch around my hips, but if I allow myself to stay in it for long enough, sometimes I'll feel something let go that I did not even realize was holding tension before. So this doesn't just apply to the hips, sometimes I'll feel it in my quads, sometimes I'll feel it in my calves or my feet. Each time, I'm just aiming to feel like something has changed from the time that I got into the stretch to the time that I get out of it. And when you're done, just get out of it in a way that makes sense to you. So modifications for this stretch. If you're having a ton of discomfort getting all the way down, then what you can do is grab a couple of yoga blocks or anything that will allow you to sit your weight down without bending your knees all the way. But the key points, the key points from the full pose still apply here. So trying to keep the ankles outside of the butt, still trying to point the toes in and keep a long spine once you've rested your weight on the yoga blocks. Another modification you can try once you're comfortable with the version shown prior is you can start leaning back further and further until your back is resting all the way on the floor. But the same key points apply. You're still trying to keep your heels outside of your butt and your toes pointed inward. So now let's go into the why of this exercise. If you watched another video we made on foot training, you will remember that the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot are one, a vertical Achilles tendon and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then when you're walking around your Achilles tendon is going to be collapsed inward and your whole foot is not going to be a tripod. This exercise addresses that by improving your ability to move your Achilles tendon outward while planting your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor. How is this relevant? Well consider that if you develop the strength to roll your ankle outwards and get that Achilles tendon to be vertical, but that this causes your entire foot to lift off the floor, then you don't have that tripod anymore. To get that tripod back, you need to be able to press your big toe mound into the floor while maintaining that vertical Achilles tendon. And this exercise, it does just that. By pinning your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor as you sit back on your ankles that are rolled out, you're improving your ability to get at the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot. So that does it for this stretch. If you'd like to check out the exercise that this stretch pairs extremely well with, click the link. And if you found the video helpful, please like the video, comment, share it with anyone you know who may also find it helpful, subscribe to the channel, and as always, remember that pain sucks, life shouldn't. I think showing that whole sequence of me getting out of it is not slowly. I think that could be valuable. Now there's gonna be... Somebody's like, how do I get out of this stretch?",4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2," 4

iKQmFoA7dsQ,"There are a number of causes of flat feet. And really the most common cause that we see is the hereditary type of flat foot that generally runs in families. Commonest type is the younger patient in their teenage or adolescent years that comes in with their parents complaining of a painless and immobile flexible flat foot. Other causes that we do see later in life usually the degenerative conditions mainly affecting the post-iliotibial tendon which will then result in gradual weakness of the foot and deformity with collapsing of the medial arch. Other conditions such as arthritic conditions and post-traumatic conditions may also present with flat foot deformities. Avoidance of flat foot deformity obviously depends on the cause and the stage of presentation. Ideally, if a patient is concerned, a full assessment by an orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist would be appropriate because the treatment may well depend on the cause and the severity. Usually, in the early stages simple orthotics and attention to correct shoe wear may help. And these would really form a medial arch support with possibly a small wedge on the inside of the orthotic and obviously a shoe with a medial support and space to fit the orthotic. If the initial stages are not manageable with simple shoe wear and orthotics, occasionally, surgery may be required.",5,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,3,3,2,3,5,4," 5

hBNstjxuGCg,"So a flat foot is when someone has lost the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. So on the big toe side you typically have a little bit higher arch than you do on the outside or the pinky toe side of the foot. And so when you've lost that, you can have pain on the inside of the foot or the arch of the foot, on the inside of the ankle. You tend to progressively notice that the arch will collapse. So once it starts to collapse it usually continues to progress. And you can even notice that the toes begin to kind of drift outward a little bit and point out to the side as opposed to pointing straight ahead as you're walking. The progression of flat foot takes months to years. It's not something that you would necessarily notice over days or weeks unless you have a traumatic rupture or injury that's causing a flat foot which can occur. But that's not the typical flat foot that we see. You can have a congenital flat foot and that's not something that necessarily needs treatment. In general we don't address a flat foot with orthotics or surgery unless the patient is having symptoms. If they're not having any pain or any issues with the function of their foot then it's just kind of one of those things that's the way you were made. So the reason that the medial longitudinal arch will collapse is usually contributed to by a tight calf muscle. When the calf muscle is tight and it increases the tension across the Achilles tendon that tries to point the foot like a ballet dancer and the ground as we're walking we don't walk on our tiptoes. And so because of the force of the ground and the tightness of the Achilles tendon the arch gets extra stress and over time can succumb to that stress and collapse. So treatment for flat foot is typically reserved for those patients that are having pain or are symptomatic from their flat foot. So if you're walking around and happen to know that you've had flat feet your whole life and they've never bothered you we don't even attempt to correct that. But if you're starting to have arch pain or you're having pain along the inside of the ankle or even the outside of the ankle typically again we always start with non-operative treatment. So that would be orthotics. Sometimes we can do injections however we try not to inject tendons due to risk of rupture for tendon injection and physical therapy to try and stretch out the calf muscle as well as strengthen the tendons and ligaments that are supposed to support the arch. Flat feet is something that we see often within the foot and ankle clinic. A lot of people coming in with medial arch pain or lateral ankle pain find out that they have flat feet and that is the cause. The majority of patients that come in for flat feet are able to be managed pretty well with conservative treatment that gives them pretty good pain relief and allows them to continue the activities that they enjoy. I would say probably 30% of patients end up having to go on to surgery and that increases with time. So maybe for 5-10 years you've done really well with orthotics and with physical therapy but as time progresses and your flat foot progresses eventually you reach a point where the pain is just too debilitating. Similar to a lot of other foot and ankle conditions it's up to the patient when it's time for surgery if they have a flat foot and they continue to have pain after we've tried therapy and injections then that's when we discuss surgical management. There's actually multiple different options for treatment for flat feet as far as surgical approaches depending on the flexibility of the foot and how mobile the foot remains and how easily we are able to correct the flat foot manually in the office as well as how much arthritis the patient has will determine what surgical option we choose or we recommend. Sometimes we're able to do that with what we consider to be joint sparing surgery meaning that we're not fusing any of the functional mobile joints so we don't stiffen the foot at all with surgery and it's mostly osteotomies and tendon transfers and maybe gastroc lengthening or calf muscle lengthening. However sometimes if the foot is more stiff and rigid or if arthritis has already set in or if it's an older patient we'll elect for arthrodesis which is the same as a fusion so we'll fuse the hind foot to stabilize the arch and to improve the function of the foot.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

iwX4_G6JZ_0,"Hello, my name is Lewis and I'm a podiatrist at East Coast Podiatry in Singapore and today we're talking about common problems associated with flatfoot. What is a flatfoot? So we've identified that this foot type is flat and what we tend to see is a flatfoot is more in an everted position like this. It's incredibly common, typically we see this a lot in children, especially of Asian descent. So typically, hypermobile flatfoot, which means very flexible, flexible in the joints, the knees, the arms can link to flatfoot. So the number one problem that we see with flatfoot is plantar heel pain. So with a flatfoot that's typically very flexible, we can stress the plantar muscles and tendons and ligaments on the bottom of the foot. So most commonly what we see in my clinic is plantar fasciitis or plantar heel pain, which is very common associated with flatfoot. Another problem we see very often is bunions. So due to the foot being in this position here, we can get a bunion formation on the big toe joint. Now this can be very painful. However, the good news is it can be addressed quite quickly, conservatively, if it's found at an early stage before it develops. So for us, what we look at doing is we identify the problem, okay? We identify why the problem is there and what's the root cause of it, and then we would manage that conservatively. High archfoot is typically associated with people of Caucasian descent. High archfoot is associated also with being stiff. So we see flexible flatfoot and we see often a rigid high archfoot. The rigidity and flexibility are both different. It's not better or worse. We just see different problems. What we would see more commonly an ankle sprain with a flatfoot. With a higher archfoot, we're much more likely to get shock impacts to the heel, Achilles tendon problems, and also we can get ankle sprains or even fractures as well. So high archfoot, the common problems that we see is heel pain because the calves tend to be very, very tight and we impact the ground very, very firmly with no shock absorption. Another one is arthritis of the big toe joint. This again associated with the stiffness means that with a rigid foot, we don't have the natural shock absorption and we smash the big toe into the ground, especially with runners. So lots of marathon runners, heel pain and knee pain with high archfoot is what we see. Typically for us, what we want to do is when patients come into my clinic and they say, Lewis, I've got a high archfoot or I've got a certain pain here. Once we've established the root cause of it and that we are dealing with a high archfoot, we then need to determine whether we need treatment or not. Now, these problems that I'm talking about, such as Achilles tendonitis at the back and the arthritis of the big toe at the front are very common. And we can actually address these conservatively without the need for steroids or injections or medication if we address it at the right time. So if this problem is picked up quite soon, we can normally identify the problem, identify the long term management of a higher archfoot with footwear, custom insoles to take away the pressure from these high pressure areas. If you feel that you're experiencing foot and ankle pain or any discomfort in the lower limb for that matter, hip pain, knee pain, especially with sports, if you're active, if you're elderly, if you're a junior, podiatrists are the people to see. They're experts in the lower limb. So if you're having foot and ankle problems and you feel that you may have got a high archfoot or a flat foot like this or anything that we've said today has been relevant and is applicable to you, please let us know in the comments below.

9tlzxA8o0w0,"Flat feet can be observed from two years old or anytime during the adult years, where the medial arch or the inner side of the foot is lowered towards the ground. If this develops during childhood, it is congenital flat foot. If it develops during adulthood, it is adult acquired flat foot. Leaving a flat foot condition without treatment can lead to long-term chronic pain. The medial arch of the foot rolls inwards, causing a chain reaction of destabilization on the ankles, knees, hips and spine. Higher up from the foot itself, the most common complaint is knee pain. This could lead to knee arthritis if it is a chronic condition. A flattened foot that has been functioning as a suboptimal orientation for so many years will eventually cause one side of the knee joint to wear out. The problem may have been prevented by correcting the feet early on in life. Flat foot is actually an umbrella term for many conditions. For example, tarsal coalition, ankle equinas, unstable OS navicule, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, midfoot arthritis, hallux upfoot for valgus and so on. Each of these conditions should be carefully considered before designing the shoe insoles. Conservative treatment for flat foot is often customized insole. Podiatrists are specialists in integrating clinical diagnosis with orthotic design, creating a specific prescription each patient needs for their optimal control and correction of the flat foot. This is never as simple as just pushing up a low arch profile with an insole. Also, podiatrists design in millimeters, not centimeters. That means our orthotic corrections must be accurate to a person's foot biomechanics by less than a fraction of a millimeter. Pain from flat feet can be easily managed conservatively.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

y6FYrADwUUs,"Flat feet affects a large percentage of the population throughout the world. Flat feet occurs because the tendons holding the joints of the foot together are loose. Dr. Aaron Bean of Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs explains this condition further and the treatments currently offered. 30 percent of adults and even kids have flat feet, the other 30 percent have a high arch foot and the rest of us have a normal type foot but probably about 30 percent of us have flat feet that may or may not hurt. There is a familiar component, we know that patients that come in even kids with a symptomatic painful flat foot, I'll always ask them, does your mom or dad have a flat foot and I'd say about 80 percent of the time they say, yea dad's got flat feet, they hurt too and we know its about time to bring him in. So definitely we think there is a genetic component. So a lot of times they get pain, the foot starts to collapse and the foot rolls in or we call pronates. So they get a lot of pain on the inside of the foot in the arch and in a severe flat foot, sometimes they'll pain on the outside of the foot or the ankle because the foot is actually collapsing and pinching the outside of the foot. Typically I start seeing kids around seven, eight years old and a lot of times these kids by the time they hit four or five years old they have a flat feet, most kids do and they grow out of it, they start to develop an arch but about seven, eight years old is when they start having pain in these feet and that's when we start seeing them come in the office and evaluate them and start a treatment program. So in the early stages especially with children, usually it's a flexible deformity. In rare cases you get an abnormal bone bridge or a congenital deformity that needs to be surgically corrected more immediately, but in most of the cases we start with a custom orthotics. So we take a mold of these children's feet- it's a match for their arch and then they wear this device that will support and lift up this flexible flat foot and a lot of times, it relaxes the tendons takes the pressure off the foot and in some instances can prevent having surgery down the road. So usually that's what we start with is a more custom molded device that fits into their shoe. Flat feet and plantar fasciitis, there definitely is a connection there. We find that patients when that arch collapses, they start to develop pain in that plantar fascia which is a ligament on the bottom of the foot. I'd say about 50 percent of my patients with a symptomatic flat foot also have plantar fasciitis. So again, we usually start with a custom molded orthotic to lift up the arch and support the foot. The arch of the foot it's not just a bony structure, there's tendons and ligaments that contribute to that, so we start with that custom orthotics and stretching and anti inflammatory and most patients get some relief with that treatment. If these patients don't respond to conservative treatment, then we have a surgical protocol that we follow that's tailored for the patient. We actually do a fair amount of flat foot surgery on patients and patients get a lot of relief. We find that with this flat foot surgery, we're preventing an arthritic foot that would have to be fused later on down the road so in patients that are in their forties and fifties, they are a good candidate for this reconstructive flat foot surgery that can prevent them from having arthritic problems that would be a more drastic motion limiting surgery down the road. We can actually restore a more normal arch and provide a foot that mechanically is more stable so that twenty, thirty years after these reconstructive flat foot surgeries the patients have a normal functioning foot and a lot of times we're finding that these adults that put off this flat foot surgery and just deal with the pain. They come to us when they're seventy, eighty years old and have a collapsed arthritic foot that can sometimes be difficult to reconstruct at that time.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4," 4

While sparing the peroneal tendons, the nervus suralis and the vena saphena parva, we incise the periosteum of the calcaneus at the level of the planned osteotomy. We use Hohmann hooks in the wound angles. Using the fluoro for guidance, we determine the osteotomy line. To ensure a planar osteotomy area, we perform an osteotomy with the oscillating saw through a cutting gauge. The osteotomy runs transversally from proximal dorsal to distal plantar at an angle of approximately 45°. Next, we mobilize the dorsal fragment with a wide chisel and move it medially by one centimeter. In the corrected position we insert a 1.6 mm thick wire from the tuber calcanei from the lateral plantar direction over the osteotomy into the anterior part of the calcaneus. After a check using the fluoro, we apply pressure to the osteotomy from the outside with large forceps. The branches of the forceps are inserted dorsally at the tuber calcanei and ventrally at the talus. Then we insert a second 1.6 mm K-wire into the transition of the plantar skin to the normal skin in the direction of the talar neck. Since the K-wire must not by any means get bent during the insertion, we use a 1.6 mm K-wire in the first place to later determine the exact position of the Shark Screw. After another check with the fluoro, we replace the 1.6 mm K-wire with a 1.2 mm K-wire, over which we then progressively drill the core hole so that the bone does not get hot. With the 5.5 mm drill we carefully enlarge the hole to the point where the end of the Shark Screw diver is supposed to be positioned later. In this case, we drill the channel 2 cm deep. That facilitates the Shark Screw diver to later slide over a bone canal to the beginning of the female thread. For a 5.0 mm Shark Screw diver, we cut the thread slowly with the black 5.0 mm thread cutter. The bone canal and female threads must be thoroughly rinsed to remove any bone debris. We then insert the Shark Screw diver using the fluoro for guidance to determine the exact position and bridging of the osteotomy gap within the calcaneus. The same procedure is followed to introduce the 2nd Shark Screw diver. We use two 5.0 mm Shark Screw divers for the calcaneal osteotomy. Finally, the smoothing of the lateral osteotomy border is performed. The patient will now be repositioned for the FDL transfer. We incise the skin along the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle behind the medial malleolus to the navicular bone. We open the tendon sheath. The tendon is resected to a 1 cm long distal stump. We expose the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle as far as the knot of Henry. In this spot, the tendon has mostly fused with the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. The tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle is severed just before the knot of Henry. If there is no connection between the tendons, as in this case, then the distal stump of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle must be sutured to that of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. We expose the navicular bone both dorsally and plantarly. We place a 1.2 mm K-wire from dorsal to plantar. After checking with the fluoro, we gradually drill up to size of the black drill and cut the female thread with the black tap, so that we can then insert a 5.0 mm Shark Screw for the tenodesis. Beforehand, we reinforce the flexor digitorum longus tendon and pull it through the hole in the navicular bone from plantar to dorsal with a threading wire. While pulling on the reinforced tendon, with light supination, and in a 20 degree equinus position, a 5.0 mm Shark Screw is threaded dorsally into the drill channel to firmly anchor the tendon in it. Since the calcaneo-navicular ligament and the medial capsule of the talonavicular joint are overstretched, we apply purse-string sutures. The proximal stump of the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle and the flexor digitorum longus muscle are sutured together in the area of the medial malleolus. This is followed by layered wound closure. The Shark Screw diver transplant is made of cortical bone and has excellent visibility on the postoperative x-ray. Due to the physiological bone metabolism, the graft is completely integrated and rebuilt. The respective postoperative care should always be assessed by the treating physician as it may vary from patient to patient. In this case, we apply a split lower leg cast in partial adduction and equinus position for 2 weeks. Following this, a closed lower leg plaster cast for another two weeks without weight-bearing, and for 2 weeks with weight-bearing, again in slight equinus position is applied. From the 7th week to the 12th week, normal street shoes can be worn with a supportive ankle brace.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,5,4,4,2,2,4,2," 4

WHGCRT9xgu0,"A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about .1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number.

0Fe0m0IF6r8,"Hi, I'm Dr. David Hill and today we're going to talk about natural cures for cluster headaches. Now cluster headaches are a particularly severe, nasty form of recurrent headache. A cluster headache is pretty much always felt on one side. Sometimes it feels like it's just an ice pick going right through your eye. It may be associated with neurologic symptoms such as tearing or even a facial droop and they tend to be intensely painful. We call them cluster headaches because they come in clusters. They're grouped together. You may have ten in one week and then none for a year after that. But when they're occurring, they can really be crippling. Now there are some medical therapies for cluster headaches but there's also one at least promising natural remedy that involves the extract of the cayenne pepper plant. This chemical is called capsaicin. Now all peppers have some degree of naturally occurring capsaicin. Some have very, very little of it. Some such as the habanero pepper have a whole, whole lot. Capsaicin is a naturally occurring irritant. That's why it gives you that hot burning sensation on your tongue when you eat it. It can also be used for pain relief by irritating the nerves that over lie the area of pain. That irritation sets up a competing response in the brain which stops paying attention to the original pain. Some people looked at this and thought, well, maybe we could use this for cluster headaches by squirting a capsaicin spray up into the nostril on the affected side of the head. And based on one relatively small trial, it does seem to be helpful. Now that said, in medicine, we like to see things repeated in multiple trials. We also like to see them put to a test for safety and efficacy in a large population. With the capsaicin spray, that hasn't happened yet. So I can't tell you that capsaicin spray is definitely very effective and definitely very safe. We just don't know that. But short of seeking medical therapy, it is one thing to try and if there's at least some indication that it may be helpful. So talking about natural therapies and remedies for the pain of cluster headaches, I'm Dr. David Hill.",4,3,4,3,4,4,2,4,3,3,2,2,2,4,2," 4

KtIeO9xn9G0,"Alright, today we're talking about headaches. Headaches are a huge issue in America. They can be caused by a couple different things. Stress for sure, but it could be chemical stress, it could be emotional stress, and it could be physical stress. Now headaches are the big reason why I got into the profession that I'm in now, which is chiropractic. I tried all kinds of different medications and treatments available to try and get rid of headaches and didn't have any success. Now there's a couple different types of headaches. There's just your normal tension headaches, there's migraine headaches, there's cluster headaches. I fell into the category of cluster headaches, which are the most severe you can think of. It's like a stabbing knife in your temple and they come in clusters. So you get one every 20-30 minutes and you get multiple headaches a day and it continues for multiple days. So it's really debilitating and doesn't let you live your life at all. And so when I was diagnosed with this issue, they gave me migraine medication, they gave me oxygen tanks, they gave me Vicodin, pretty much anything you can think of. And most of it didn't do anything for me. It helped maybe once or twice and then it just ceased to fix anything or help anything. So I went to the hospital most of the time when I had these headaches because it was the only way I could relieve them. And what they gave me was morphine shots. Now the problem with morphine shots is you only get a couple before they cut you off completely. And the reason they cut you off is because the stuff is so addictive that they can't give you too much of it. Now needless to say I used up all my shots really quickly within a couple months. And at that point I was like where do I go now? So I went to the massage therapist and the massage therapist massaged and it helped a lot. It relieved me my pain for a little while but always came back 10-15 minutes later. And the reason it always came back is because what I had going on was pressure on my nerves. Pressure gets put on my nerves by the bones and the tissue surrounding it. Now if you don't do anything to remove that pressure, like taking a drug or an Advil or getting massage done, that pressure is going to stay there and it's going to continue to come back as soon as the drug wears off or as soon as the beneficial effects from the massage wear off. So luckily I found a chiropractor and the chiropractor explained to me what was going on and then proceeded to adjust me. After my first adjustment I never had the headaches again. They were gone. Which is obviously why I'm doing what I'm doing today because it was such a life-changing experience for me. Now to say that everybody has those kinds of effects, it's not the truth. Because a lot of people take more than one adjustment. Some take three, some takes more than that. It just depends on where your body's at and what you've been through. It just so happened that I only needed one but the next person down the street might need more than that. But what I do know is that chiropractic can absolutely help headaches. Not just cluster headaches like I had which tend to be the most severe cases but the migraine headaches and then just the tension headaches that we get every day or that I see coming in my office every day from people at work looking down at their desk. I'd love to talk to anyone who wants more information on this topic, has questions about it and wants to know how chiropractic can help them. Comment below, subscribe to the channel and I'd love to hear from you guys.",4,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,3," 4

eftSLa_Li6M,"Cluster headache is the topic for this video. And cluster headache is one of the many types of headaches, but it's commonly tested on the licensing exams. And it most commonly occurs in men. It can occur in a very range of ages, but 20 to 40 is most common. And the symptoms, obviously from the name of the topic, it's obviously a headache, but it's in particular unilateral, one-sided. And it commonly occurs at night, so it awakens the person from sleep. And there's certain keywords that they tend to always use when describing this headache, and one of them is excruciating. So these are some of the keywords. If you really sort of get into the actual symptomatology, or symptoms, some of the key symptoms that they commonly describe are runny nose, rhinorrhea, teary, lachrymation, and pitosis, which is a drooping of the eyelid. And this headache can be pretty distressing and can occur again and again. And it can also be episodic in nature as well. The diagnosis, really, there's no diagnostic test. It's really just based on symptoms and history. Treatment. The most common treatment that they test on the licensing exams is you give the person 100% oxygen. That is actually the treatment for cluster headaches. There are two medications that are used as well. The first one is called ergotamine. And the second type of medication is known as atryptan. That's the class. And one of the most common is sumatryptan. So, that's the treatment. So, quickly recapping. Cluster headache. You've got a unilateral presentation. In terms of location, they describe it periorbital around the eye. Possibly even temporal region. In men, 20 to 40 years of age. Symptoms include drooping of the eyelid. You've got lachrymation. Runny nose, rhinorrhea. And you can also have these attacks in clusters, and hence the name. But what you really mean by that is sort of like this episodic nature where you have it for 1 to 3 months. And then it goes away, but then it comes back. And then the treatment includes oxygen, ergotamine, and the tryptan class of headache medicines. So, let's look at some clinical vignettes. 50 year old man presents with history of recurrent attacks of headache which manifest with peculiar rhythmic pattern. Each attack begins on awakening approximately at the same time. He reports severe unilateral plane located in the right eye and temple. Accompanied by runny nose, lachrymation, and sweating on the same side. The attack spontaneously resolves after 2 hours. Neither his siblings nor his parents had similar headaches. Temperatures 96, blood pressures 130 over 80, pulses 80. Pupils are equal and normally reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is most likely diagnosis? There's a lot of clues in here. You've got the fact that it awakens him. It's around the periorbital and temporal region. You've got the rhinorrhea, the lachrymation. So, all points to cluster headache. Next one. A 55 year old man comes to the physician because of severe daily severe periorbital right-sided headaches over the past 6 weeks. Pain often awakens him from sleep and is so excruciating that he wants to bang his head against the wall. He reports nasal stuffiness and nausea. He has had similar episodes on 2 previous occasions. Physical exam shows right-sided pitosis, lachrymation, and reddening of the right eye. Lab studies, hemoglobin 16, hematocrit 49, leukocyte count 6000, and ESR 5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Again, a lot of clues in there. They throw in this ESR because that's elevated in temporal arteritis. They talk about that because in temporal arteritis the ESR is elevated. So, just in case you're wondering why they put that in there. But this case is clearly describing a cluster headache. And one last one. A 43 year old man comes to the emergency department at 3 am because of constant severe headache for 1 hour. Pain is localized behind the left eye. He also had a watery discharge from the left nostril. He has had similar episodes nightly over the past week. He has had a history of similar symptoms over a 3 week period to 2 years ago. His left pupil is smaller than his right and the raspitosis on the left watery discharge is visible in the left naris. Most likely diagnosis is. Again, a lot of symptomatology pointing to cluster headache.",4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,4," 4

7N8gzaATY2o,"During one particular bad attack there was a Black & Decker drill that was lying actually on the window sill and I really seriously thought about picking it up and drilling through my temple. It's like someone drilling through the top of my head and at the same time they're trying to shove a knitting needle through my ear and a nail through the back of my head. You've probably never heard of it but it's one of the most painful headaches you can get. Often confused with migraine, it's ten times more painful. Anyway I can ever describe it is when you have ice cream when you're a child and it hits the nerve above the eye, it's called ice pick headache. It's like that but it lasts up to three hours, a hundred times worse and you literally are suicidal. Cluster headache is often referred to as suicide headache and there's a publication in one of the headache journals that actually shows an x-ray of a cluster headache patient who literally stuck a shotgun in his eye and pulled the trigger and shot throughout his brain. Extraordinarily he actually managed to survive. The closest I ever came to suicide was one morning at 4.30 I was going to kill myself and I thought I've got a rope in the garage, I'll get the rope out of the garage and I'll throw it around the oak tree that was in the back garden and I went into the garage to get the rope and my son had used it to tie all his toys up so I couldn't even use the rope and I wasn't capable of actually undoing the rope. You're capable of absolutely nothing at all except screening. A thought expressed by every cluster headache sufferer at one time or another. All say that suicide can sometimes appear the only way to escape the pain. We can't get the oxygen, what are we supposed to do? The first time I had it I actually thought I was having a brain hemorrhage and I got some sort of brain tumour or something like that and this was it, this was the end and then it goes away and then it comes back in and it goes away and if something's wrong here but the actual attack, which it is an attack, it generally almost always focuses on one side of the head and the face, it can stretch down to the jaw, into the shoulder sometimes, it's absolutely excruciating. At the onset of cluster headache I was episodic where I'd go on average for about six weeks without anything in pain free remission and then I'd have a four week bout and then six weeks off, four weeks on. Eventually I turned chronic where I didn't get any breaks, the bouts just extended and became one bout. But more recently I went back to episodic again but you never know how it might just jump out at you and off you go again on the merry trip. My personal worst was the 15th of June 2005 where I actually had 15 attacks varying between 15 minutes and three hours and I was absolutely exhausted. Chronic sufferer Mike Pollock has lived with it since he was six and has had daily attacks for nearly 20 years. There's no cure and nobody knows what causes it. He needs daily injections and oxygen but says it's difficult to get the right treatment. Trying to get control is very important so we do have drugs like verapamil for example that we can use to try to reduce the frequency and the severity of the attacks as they actually occur but people are experiencing needing to take quite strong medicines to get the condition under control. I'm absolutely astounded by the way that people experiencing these severe headaches will just try and fight on through and battle on through and it really upsets me when people outside who don't understand what the headaches are like are just thinking that people are taking day off because they've got the day off just because they've got another headache. I don't think anyone would be able to understand what we have to enjoy, it would just be impossible so I tend to keep quiet about it. At the moment there's little or no hope for us as far as a cure is concerned.",3,2,4,2,3,2,2,5,2,2,2,2,2,2,2," 3

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear.

N8zI12C937Y,"Hey everybody, this is Dr. Chris Kelch from Avondale Health Center in Avondale, Arizona. Today we're going to talk about another type of headache. This information is straight from WebMD. If you want more information, please go to this website. The type of headache in question we're going to talk about, thankfully you don't see very often, it's not very common, but they've been known to be so severe that they can actually cause people to commit suicide. They hurt that much. The headache in question is a headache called a cluster headache. So a cluster headache feels basically like an ice pick has been driven into your skull. Now what happens is, there's a bundle of nerves called your sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. It points to this bundle of nerves right here. What happens is this group of nerves gets overstimulated. When it gets overstimulated, you get severe pain in the head. Now it can mimic a migraine, it can mimic something called trigeminal neuralgia, so it's important to get the proper diagnosis. With this type of headache, it's important to probably get an MRI or a CT scan of the head too to make sure you don't have anything like a tumor going on. So once that's all ruled out, there's a way that we can treat that. There's something called an SPG nerve block. What an SPG nerve block is, is that it's a way that you can go in there and desensitize that bundle of nerves so that it's not as active. There's a very safe way to do it. I'm going to talk about that right now. So the used to go into here, remove part of your jaw and part of your face, and go in there and basically kill this part of your nerve. Well, that didn't work. So now, more recently, what they would do is put a Q-tip up each nostril, keep it there for 30 minutes, and hope that the medicine on the end of it would reach this bundle of nerves. Well, that doesn't work very well because a lot of times the medicine doesn't reach that bundle of nerves. And sometimes it's dangerous because it actually can puncture something called your cribriform plate, which can actually cause brain damage. So what happened was, a couple years ago, this genius gentleman that we met, this medical doctor developed a patented device that actually forms and fits very specifically into the nostril cavity here. And it sprays the medicine directly onto that bundle of nerves. So it allows you to use less medication than you would otherwise. It's more effective and it works awesome. Our patients who get this treatment for migraine headaches might not have headaches for up to six months if they follow our protocol. So it works very, very well. So what we're going to do here at the end of this video is I'm going to show you a demonstration of how this works, show you how easy it is, show you how safe it is. If you have any questions or want any more information on this procedure, if you have cluster headaches, feel free to look at the end of the video and go to our web page. On the web page, we have a free consultation coupon for you to come into our clinic. Basically if you come into our clinic, we help determine exactly what kind of headache you're having and then we can kind of go from there. So thanks for watching. So what we've got here is Avalon is getting the medicine ready. The medicine is just a local numbing agent helping to desensitize the nerve. So she's putting it in his nostril. She puts a little pressure on the plunger. The medicine goes in. She's done with that side already. He blows his nose. That gets the medicine moving more. She's getting the medicine ready for the other nostril. She go ahead and put that into the other nostril. That will numb that area as well. And boom, she's done.",3,2,3,2,2,2,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2," 3

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video is about a specific type of headache called a cluster headache and how it can be treated with an SPG nerve block using a patented device. However, the video is also promoting the clinic where the doctor works and offering a free consultation coupon. The video is informative, but it also has a marketing aspect that makes the aims less clear."," 2

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims because it provides some information about cluster headaches and the SPG nerve block treatment. However, it lacks proper medical references, and the demonstration is not very clear or detailed. The video also seems to be more of a promotional video for the clinic rather than an educational one."," 3

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses a specific type of headache, cluster headache, and its treatment. However, the video is not very informative about the condition itself, and it mainly serves as an advertisement for a specific clinic and treatment method. The video also does not provide any evidence or research to support the effectiveness of the treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video is clear about the source of information used to compile the publication, which is WebMD. However, the video does not provide any other sources of information, and it is unclear whether the author has verified the information from WebMD or is simply repeating it. Additionally, the video does not cite any scientific studies or research to support the claims made about the treatment for cluster headaches. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially,' as the video is clear about one source of information but lacks other sources and supporting evidence."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The video provides some useful information about cluster headaches and the SPG nerve block treatment. However, the video also contains some issues that make it less clear. For example, the video does not cite the original source of the information about cluster headaches, which is WebMD. This could lead to confusion or misinformation for viewers who are not familiar with the source. Additionally, the video does not provide any evidence or data to support the claim that the patented device is more effective and safer than previous methods of administering the same treatment. The video also does not mention any potential side effects or risks associated with the treatment. Therefore, the video is only partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced."," 2

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because it is promoting a specific product and treatment for cluster headaches without providing any comparison to other treatments or discussing potential side effects or risks. The video also seems to be sponsored or endorsed by the company that developed the patented device, as the doctor refers to the inventor as a ""genius"" and thanks the company at the end. Additionally, the video does not cite any sources other than WebMD for the information about cluster headaches, which is not sufficient for a medical video."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details about a specific type of headache, cluster headache, and how it can be treated with an SPG nerve block. However, it does not provide additional sources of support and information beyond the WebMD website, which is mentioned only once. The video does not mention any other organizations, websites, or resources that could help people with cluster headaches or those who want to learn more about the condition. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the doctor mentions that the headache in question, a cluster headache, can mimic other types of headaches, such as migraines or trigeminal neuralgia, making it important to get a proper diagnosis. Second, the doctor suggests getting an MRI or CT scan of the head to rule out other potential causes, such as a tumor. Third, the doctor introduces a new treatment method that has been developed by a ""genius gentleman"" and claims that it is more effective and safer than previous methods, but does not provide any scientific evidence or studies to support these claims. Therefore, there is some uncertainty regarding the effectiveness, safety, and accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment methods discussed in the video."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment works, but it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the treatment or how it differs from previous methods. The video focuses more on the history of the treatment and the benefits of the new device rather than the mechanism of action of the treatment itself."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatment for cluster headaches. The speaker explains that the treatment involves a patented device that sprays medicine directly onto the bundle of nerves, which is more effective and safer than previous methods. The speaker also claims that patients who receive this treatment may not experience headaches for up to six months if they follow the protocol. However, the video does not provide any evidence or data to support these claims, nor does it compare the treatment to other possible treatments for cluster headaches. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment. It only mentions the risks of the older method of using a Q-tip, but does not compare it to the new method or discuss the risks of the new method. The video focuses more on the effectiveness of the new method and the ease of the procedure."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only talks about the treatment options for cluster headaches, specifically the SPG nerve block. The video does not mention any natural course or consequences of untreated cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It only explains one specific treatment for cluster headaches, the SPG nerve block, and how it works. The video does not mention any other treatment options or compare the effects of the treatment on the patient's quality of life. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor mentions one specific treatment, the SPG nerve block, and demonstrates it in the video. However, he also mentions that there are other ways to treat cluster headaches, such as an MRI or CT scan to rule out other issues, and that there are other ways to perform the SPG nerve block that are less effective or more dangerous. The video does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible treatment choices, but it does suggest that there are alternatives to the one demonstrated."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about a specific type of headache, cluster headache, and a treatment option called SPG nerve block. However, it does not provide any information about the patient's preferences, risks, benefits, or alternatives to the treatment. The video is mainly promoting the clinic and the treatment device, which makes it biased. Therefore, it only partially supports shared decision-making.",set(),149
YFKMB8LNeMc,"It's one of the most painful conditions known to humans, cluster headache, a pain so severe that female sufferers say it's worse than childbirth. The attacks can recur again and again over many months. Now the charity Ouch, which stands for Organization for the Understanding of Cluster Headache, is fighting to raise awareness of this incurable condition and to provide support for sufferers and their families. Music Cluster headache manifests with strikingly characteristic features. Each attack can last up to three hours if left untreated. The pain is so intense that most sufferers cannot sit still during an attack. Some sufferers have been known to commit suicide because they can no longer bear the pain. Around a quarter of a million people in the UK suffer from cluster headache. That's about four for every 1,000 of the population. It's estimated that cluster headache is 10 times more painful than migraine. Cluster headache is a recurrent form of headache with terrible disabling attacks of pain usually on one side of the head that are associated with particular features like eye watering and redness and usually with agitation in their behaviour. They come and they go, they blight a person when they're there and they disappear. Val Hobbs has up to four of these cluster headache attacks a day. The headache's cause is unknown and so far there are only two treatments that have proved to bring some relief to sufferers. A self-administered injection of a drug called Imigram. This treatment is relatively expensive and so GPs can be unwilling to prescribe it. Breathing oxygen at a high rate for 15 to 20 minutes has also been shown to provide effective pain relief. It just totally takes you over. There is nothing, there is just the pain. And I can understand why sadly some sufferers have taken their own lives because you just want to get rid of the pain. Unfortunately, cluster headache is a lifelong disorder and the charity Ouch! was set up to support the ongoing needs of sufferers. Their mission is clear. To get GPs and neurologists to understand the agony that we go through and the fact that we do not get the medication that we are promised by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Ouch!, the Organisation for Understanding Cluster Headache, is just the most wonderful example of an expert patient group working within and outside the NHS to improve our understanding of the disease, to help promote the disease to doctors and within the NHS and to patients and to provide support for patients. They're crucial, they're unique and they're expert.",4,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,4,3,4,4," 4

However, the video could have been more concise and focused on the main points. The video also provides some information about the treatments available for the condition, which is helpful but not directly related to the main aim of raising awareness."," 4

The video achieves its aims partially. It provides a clear and concise explanation of cluster headaches, their symptoms, and the impact they have on sufferers. It also highlights the work of the charity Ouch! in raising awareness and providing support for sufferers and their families. However, the video could have been more effective if it included more information about the treatments available for cluster headaches, such as Imigram and oxygen therapy, and how they can be accessed by sufferers. Additionally, the video could have explored the potential for further research and development of new treatments for this debilitating condition."," 5

Explanation: The video is relevant because it provides a detailed description of cluster headache, its symptoms, and the impact it has on sufferers. It also highlights the work of the charity Ouch! in raising awareness and providing support for those affected by this condition. The video is informative and raises awareness about a painful and often misunderstood condition."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about the sources used to compile the publication, such as the charity Ouch and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence.

The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a good overview of cluster headache, its symptoms, prevalence, and the challenges faced by sufferers. It also mentions the charity Ouch! and their efforts to raise awareness and provide support. However, the transcript could have been more precise in some areas, such as specifying the exact prevalence of cluster headache in the UK and providing more details on the treatments available. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 4

Explanation: The video is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it presents information about the condition, its symptoms, and the challenges faced by sufferers. It also mentions the efforts of the charity Ouch! to raise awareness and provide support. However, there are some instances where the video could be seen as slightly biased, such as when it states that cluster headache is ""10 times more painful than migraine"" without providing any comparison or evidence for this claim. Additionally, the video could have explored more the treatment options and their limitations, as well as the potential for further research and advancements in the field. Overall, the video is mostly balanced and unbiased, but could benefit from some improvements in terms of providing a more comprehensive and evidence-based perspective."," 4

The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the charity Ouch! and the treatments mentioned (Imigram and oxygen therapy). However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help cluster headache sufferers. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, it mentions that the cause of cluster headache is unknown, which implies that there is uncertainty about its underlying mechanisms. Second, it states that there are only two treatments that have proven to provide some relief, but one of them is relatively expensive and GPs may be unwilling to prescribe it. This suggests that there is uncertainty about the availability and affordability of effective treatments. Third, it highlights the mission of the charity Ouch! to raise awareness and improve the understanding of the disease, which implies that there is uncertainty about the public's knowledge and perception of cluster headache. Therefore, the video partially refers to areas of uncertainty, and the score is 4."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how each treatment works.

BEKdACSjOJ4,"No review of migraine would be complete without the discussion of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a distinct, although rare, clinical entity that occurs in 0.4% of the population. Attacks of headache occur several times a day in clusters for several days or weeks at a time. The headaches are shorter than migraine, last from 15 to 30 minutes, and up to 2 to 3 hours. The pain is usually severe, knife-like, unilateral, and usually centered around the orbits or supraorbital area. Autonomic features such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, meiosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema are all part of the syndrome. Patients are then headache-free between clusters. Unlike migraine, cluster headache is predominantly a male disorder beginning between the ages of 20 and 50, with a male-to-female ratio of 4 to 1. Joe has cluster headaches, which occur every four months or so, and usually the headaches last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. A headache can last anywhere from minutes to hours. How long have you been having headaches? I've had cluster headaches diagnosed now for the last three years. How often do you get headaches? Cycles about every four months, and the cluster can last as long as 2 to 4 weeks. What age were you when the headaches first began? I started around about 44. I'm 47 now. Do you know when a headache is coming on? Do you have an aura? No, no precursors that would indicate I'm going to get a cluster headache. When the pain starts, that's the start of the cluster headache. When you get a headache and you're in a cluster, do you have many headaches during the day? One or two clusters in a 24-hour period, but they can come one after the other over a period of two weeks. Are there any aggravating or precipitating factors that you can see? None that I can put my finger on right now as to what will precipitate a cluster headache. When you get a headache, where's the pain located? It's a very sharp, stabbing pain in my eyeball and then the burning sensation around the orbit of the eye. It'll go back through the temple, into the back of my head, and then down my neck. What's the longest that the pain has lasted? For one cluster headache, I've performed medication headwind that lasted about eight hours long. On a scale of one to five, with five being the worst possible pain, how would you describe your pain? About a four. I would say a compound fracture would be a five. Do you have associated symptoms with these headaches? Yes, the side that the cluster headache is on, that sinus will have a very sharp burning sensation. That sinus will run. The eye on that side will tear, and sometimes I'll have that burning sensation go up into my scalp also. Do you have any members of the family with migraine headaches or cluster headaches? Yes, a brother, a sister, and my mother suffer from migraines, or have suffered from migraines in the past. Do any of them have cluster headaches? None have been diagnosed with cluster headaches so far. Have you ever had any diagnostic studies done? I've had an MRI for my neck and my head. Are they normal? They were read as normal, yes. What medications have you tried in the past? In the past, there have been a number of medications that I've tried. Prophylactic naprosyn, and metaprolol, and amitriptyline. And then to treat the pain, there was a Kefrigot, Migrenol, Stadol nasal spray, Furoset, Furoenol, a number of painkillers, Tylenol with codeine. What medication are you taking now? Sumatriptin, injectable, and then the Emerge tablet. And do these medications totally relieve your headache? They've been phenomenal is the word I would use. It has taken the cluster headache and knocked it down to where there's no pain. Now these headaches, are they disabling? Yes, I found that stabbing pain in my eye so intense that I couldn't work. I would have to leave my desk, walk away from the computer, try to find some quiet place, or go home. Leave for the rest of the day. And now? Now I can take a Sumatriptin injectable an hour later, take the Emerge, and by that time the cluster headache is done. It's finished. Joe represents a typical case of cluster headaches. He has tried multiple medications in the past. He now has 100% relief from Sumatriptin injections. Because cluster headaches are so brief, injectable Sumatriptin or nasal Sumatriptin are the only tryptons which work fast enough to give the patient relief of his headaches. How do you treat cluster headaches? One, oxygen is the standard recommended treatment with 100% oxygen administered at 7 to 10 liters per minute for approximately 15 minutes. Approximately 70% of patients will get some relief from their pain. Two, Subcutaneous Sumatriptin is an effective medication for acute symptoms. The medication may have to be repeated with a second dose. And finally, three, Prednisone given in large doses during an attack will help suppress headaches.",4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4," 4

It's often incorrectly treated as migraine perhaps because one of its older names was migraineous neuralgia or incorrectly cluster migraine but it needs very specific treatment that's very different from migraine treatment. These are episodes that typically affect men in their 20s to 40s that will come as the name suggests as a cluster usually lasting about 6 to 8 weeks, sometimes about once a year, usually at the same time of year and they will experience excruciating headaches typically waking them from their sleep about a couple of hours after they go to bed that build up like that very very quickly and unlike migraine where people want to stay still and not move around, the agitation that accompanies cluster headache is absolutely extreme. They don't know where to put themselves and it's completely one-sided. One eye will be affected, it will go red, the one eye will run, the nose on the same side will run and it's literally focusing like a piercing hot poker in that one eye. After about two hours, it will fade away and disappear but then the same thing will happen the subsequent night or even up to eight attacks per day in some cases.

aHOuZYQa3bI,"What is a cluster headache? Cluster headache is a relatively rare, very severe form of headache. We call it a primary headache in that it's not due to something. And it occurs mostly in men. And it is a form of headache in which people have attacks anywhere from every other day to eight times a day, but generally short attacks one to three times per day. These attacks are just terrible. And they are incapacitating attacks. Generally the pain is around the eye, the forehead, the temple. Very, very, very severe. And people who get these attacks are very agitated. They do the opposite of what a migraine person does where they go to a dark, quiet room. No. Patients with cluster run around. They rock. They're incredible, incredibly agitated. And then they have a whole series of other features. They can feel full in the ear on the same side. They can have swelling of the face on the same side. They can get a droopy eye on the same side. Their eye turns red. The eye tears. The nose runs. The nose gets stuffy. And these are called cranial autonomic symptoms. And they are one of the hallmarks of cluster headache. And these attacks, which last generally about an hour, occur always on the same side and often, and this is very unusual, occur at exactly the same time of day every day. This is called circadian periodicity. And they sometimes will occur in the middle of the night and awaken somebody from sleep every single night with a severe headache, utterly disabling, complete with agitation, lasting an hour, two hours, three hours. These are really suicidal-level headaches. Migraine occurs in about 18 percent of women, six percent of men. Cluster occurs three to one, male to female. It occurs more often in men who are smokers. So middle-aged smoking men is the group that tends to get cluster, although it can occur in women. It's more unusual. And cluster comes in two varieties. It comes in one group called episodic cluster headache in which people will get these daily attacks for a month, two months, three months, and then they will stop. Just as mysteriously as they started, a person will have a long period with no attacks, six months, a year. And then they'll have another cycle of one to three months. That's called episodic cluster headache, and each cycle is called a cluster period or a cluster cycle. The attack is different than the cycle. The attack is the number of headaches that occur in a day during a cycle. The second form of cluster is chronic cluster. Chronic cluster patients never get a month off from cluster in a year. They're getting these attacks every day, every other day, multiple times a day, ongoing, year after year. I don't think we know the actual cause, but we know the anatomy. We know where it comes from. It comes from an area in the brain called the hypothalamus, and this area of the brain has a generator that turns on at the beginning of the cluster, and that generator is very close to the area in the hypothalamus where our circadian rhythms come from, our day-night cycling, our monthly cycling, our yearly cycling. All of those cycles come from the hypothalamus, and the generator in cluster turns on in the hypothalamus on the same side as the attack. And then we know the actual anatomy of how the nerves go from the hypothalamus down to the lower brain and out, and when they do go out, they go through a particular area called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or the SPG, which is kind of a target for some of the cluster treatments. But what's going on in cluster is very exciting. There are all sorts of aspects of cluster now that two, three years from now we may be treating completely differently than we are now. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? The way to think about treatment for cluster is that there are kind of groups of treatment. One kind of treatment is called transitional treatment, and that's where we give treatment to cluster patients to buy time so that we can put in preventive treatments. Transitional treatments involve generally steroids, oral steroids, or greater occipital nerve blocks using steroids as well as Novocain, and those will give patients relief for a week or two while we desperately and quickly try to put in our preventive treatment. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? Well, the most important aspect and most important advice I have is for every cluster patient to get a headache specialist to help treat, because for most cluster patients we can treat, not everybody. And some people don't tolerate Verapamil. Some people can't take Tryptans or Ergots because they have vascular disease. Shockingly and inexcusably, the federal government refuses to pay for oxygen for patients on Medicare and Medicaid who have cluster headache, and this is a violation of the standard of care. It's a violation of the guidelines of our professional organizations. We go to other countries and they cannot believe that our government does not provide cover oxygen for our most disabled patients. Many people think that cluster headache is the most painful headache, and it's the standard of care worldwide. The good news about this is, number one, most commercial insurances will pay for oxygen, and number two, we were able to publish an article this year that listed the cost of buying oxygen when the federal government won't pay, when somebody on Medicare or Medicaid needs oxygen who has cluster. And it's in most states, not Alaska, but in most states the oxygen is actually affordable, especially for patients with episodic cluster. So it's not the end of the world that Medicare won't pay for it, because very often cluster patients can afford to buy it because it's not terribly expensive. But the key is to get a provider who can diagnose it and who has a plan for how to treat. And without that, cluster patients are really, really in trouble. What is the future of cluster? The future of cluster is really exciting right now. It turns out that one of the chemicals that appears to be associated with causing migraine also appears to be associated with causing cluster headache, and that chemical is calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP. And a variety of companies have developed antibodies to either CGRP or the CGRP receptor, and these antibodies are being tested in what the government is allowing to be registration or pivotal trials. The rumor on the street is that the outcomes look really good, although none of the data are public, and I'm not part of those studies. I'm just passing on what I hear, but what I hear is great, and if these all prove to be safe and effective in cluster, the way they work is a patient could simply inject once a month or once a quarter one of these monoclonal antibodies and actually prevent cluster without a lot of side effects and without taking a daily medicine. So on the one hand, the monoclonal antibodies against CGRP look very promising and hopeful as designer medications to prevent cluster. On the other hand, there is a device that is about this big and is inserted through the mouth, and a good surgeon can get it in in under 15 minutes, and it has no external wires, and it's screwed into the skull, and then a remote controller is used, and this device sits over the sphenopalatine ganglion, the SPG, that key outflow point for cluster headache, and this device, this implantable SPG stimulator, has been already tested in Europe, approved in Europe for chronic cluster headache, and works in about two-thirds of patients in which the patient can either terminate a cluster attack or prevent cluster attacks or both. So there's never been a more hopeful time for cluster patients than right now, and the hope is that in three or four years our treatment will be vastly improved for cluster.

8SzLaz0Qk0s,"I'm Alexander Mauskob, director of the New York Headache Center. Cluster migraines. There are cluster headaches which are different from migraine headaches. Cluster headaches usually affect men. Fortunately, they're not as common as migraines. Only less than half a percent of the population suffers from clusters, while about 12 percent of the population suffers from migraines. More men than women suffer from cluster headaches. Excruciating pain. Some people call these headaches suicide headaches because the pain is so unbearable, even though it's very short. One or two hours, and the headache is gone. And patients know that. It comes and goes, but the pain is so intolerable, they're thinking about suicide, actually. So cluster headaches are occurring in clusters. That's where the name comes from. That is, you get one headache every single day for a month or two, and then the headache is gone for a year. And then next year, it comes back. There are some patients who have migraines and have cluster headaches, and sometimes we can't tell them apart. The difference between cluster and migraines is cluster is always on one side, in the eye. Tearing is a very common sign of a cluster headache. Nasal congestion, and people become agitated. Migraine patients would rather lie down and rest and not move. Cluster patients rock and walk around and scream, yell, bang their head against the wall. A very different picture. But again, there are some people in whom we can't tell the difference. It lasts longer than the typical cluster. It does not come in clusters, but it's pain in the eye and tearing, so we can't make up our mind. The good thing is that treatment often is similar. Same drugs can be effective for migraines and cluster headaches, and those include epilepsy drugs like Depakote, Topamax. Blood pressure drugs like Verapamil is my favorite. Steroid medication can abort the whole cluster. We use Botox injections for both, but migraines respond better. Imitrex, which is sumatriptan injections, is the only treatment approved for acute cluster headache. We use also oxygen for clusters, which doesn't work for migraines, but Imitrex works for both. So there are many, many options as to treatment of cluster headaches and migraines, and sometimes that overlaps both the condition overlaps and the treatment overlaps.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,2,3,5,2," 4

ODw2eunhIts,"Guys, what's up this is Mobin. So the mini bean today is about the cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are the only chronic headache syndrome that is more common in men than women. Two-third of the men compared to women. The other thing is that it is usually Nocturnal. 50% of the men complain of this issue at night. It is a deep, excruciating, explosive, non-fluctuating, severe pain that occurs retroorbital and then spreads to one half of the cranium, hemikranium. The episodes occur about 8 to 10 weeks. So weeks to months in one year and then there is a gap for about a year and then it occurs again. Such episodes are called cluster headache and if the episodes occur after each other and there is no remission, there is no gap of that one year without treatment or the remission is lesser than a month without treatment, then that is called chronic cluster headache. The cluster headache seems to be because of the pacemaker neurons or because of the circadian rhythm neuron in the posterior hypothalamus and their dysfunction. Usually what happens is that with that dysfunction, parasympathetic system dysfunctions as well and that causes lacrimation and Rhenoria and stuffy nose and even Horner syndrome and pallor. But again on one side. Sympathetic effect may be present as well. A couple of important differences between the cluster headache and migraine are interesting. Number one, the patient of cluster headache usually they pace around, they move, they rub their head, they want the pain to go away, they are agitated, they are angry. On the other hand, the patient of a migraine tends to be motionless and quiet and at rest. The other difference is that migraine is usually associated with nausea and vomiting but there is no nausea and vomiting in cluster headaches. The most effective and rapid treatment for the acute attack is 100% oxygen therapy. One can give subcutaneous verapamil or nasal verapamil or other like endomethacin, other treatments but these are not as rapid and effective as 100% pure oxygen so that is a treatment of choice. In case of prophylaxis, as soon as the patient gets the first attack, what happens is patient should start on verapamil and that will be the prophylactic medicine. Again for prophylaxis as well there are more medicines for example ergods or endomethacin or NSAIDs however verapamil is usually started right away. For the chronic headache, cluster headache, lithium is used as a treatment. If you want to see more of these videos, please like and subscribe to this channel and also share it with your friends.

kQeRSX3g4-8,"Now recently we were asking you on our Facebook page about various ailments and things that you suffered on a regular basis and how often. And the biggest one that's come out is headaches and migraines. And one in particular, cluster headaches, which I have to say I'd never heard of. I've got Dr Chris with us this morning. Chloe Silverwood, Chris, says it's a serious and very debilitating condition with no cure it seems. Amy Matthews, the most painful thing known to man. Sophie Mills, hi Sophie, she said my husband has suffered with cluster headaches for five years. It's ruined our lives. He's lost so many precious days and birthdays without us and his beautiful children. So this, I've never heard of them. Yeah, I mean it's not common, in fact about one in a thousand. But we've had this response because cluster headaches are severe, excruciatingly painful headaches. Sometimes termed suicidal headaches. The headache is so intense patients will bash their head against the wall. Now let me just explain it. Cluster headaches, because they occur in clusters, you might get one, two, three, four attacks a day lasting 15, 30 minutes. But then they occur every day for weeks and even months. Then you go for months and have no headaches at all. Then they come back in a cluster. And I mean... Is that, do you know the cause why people get... Well, it's like migraine, you know, what is the cause? We know it's a disturbance of blood supply in the brain and a disturbance or imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain. But with the cluster headache it comes on suddenly. It's severe. It's usually one-sided and you get changes on that one side. Migraine or migraine might be like all of those things as well. Yeah, but the cluster is far more, far more severe. Yeah. And of course it's occurring, you know, three or four times a day every day for months and months. Now, with the cluster headache you get other signs. You can get a red eye, a watery eye, stuffy nose, blocked nose, flushing of one side of the face or sweating on one side of the face. So when a doctor hears the symptom, it's cluster headaches. Now, the problem with cluster headaches is that it may be treated by alcohol, can be triggered by excess heat. So if you're exercising in a hot atmosphere, you can bring them on. Even solvents, petrols, perfumes could trigger, but everybody's different. OK. So how do you treat it? Now, this is your paracetamol, your ibuprofen, they will not work at all, right? What you need to do, if these symptoms I'm describing sound like you, you go and see your GP because the GP can treat you with a drug, a group of drugs called tryptans. Now, tryptans came out years ago for migraine. Now, tryptans, you can self-inject straight into the thigh. You can have a nasal spray or sublingual tablets, so they're very fast acting and they can help. Now, the GP could prescribe that, but you may be passed on to a specialist clinic where you may be given oxygen and other drugs that can control it. Well, Chris, just to get you through some of the other ones which are less specialist, these are called primary headaches and one of which is a tension headache, self-explanatory. Well, yeah, you know, the commoner garden headache, you know, about 70% of headaches are the tension type headaches, can be caused by stress, can be caused by just everything around you, bad posture in your chair. But easily sorted. Well, of course, what do we do? We treat ourselves with paracetamol and ibuprofen and that usually does the trick. But a headache that's persisting despite that form of treatment needs to be checked out by you. So don't ignore a persistent headache every day and keeps going back. And migraine, you mentioned, you threw in there saying it could sometimes people with cluster headaches might think it's migraine. What's the difference? Well, migraine is very common. Eight million sufferers in the country. And with migraine, it's not just a headache. If you've not had migraine, oh, it's just a headache. Now, we've got Sarah Hardy here. She says, and Anna Lees Owens, migraines make me vomit and I get shakes. It's not a headache like other people think. You get nausea, dizziness, numbness, disturbed vision. Mine can go on for days. It's absolutely exhausting. She's describing some of the classic symptoms. And again, it's a severe pounding, throbbing headache usually affecting one side. About 80% of sufferers, 80, 90% get nausea, 20, 30% get vomiting and you dislike bright lights and loud noises. One of the factors is obviously recognizing the trigger. If you can actually self-diagnose and recognize and what brings this on, that's your halfway here. And you can do this. Just keep a diary. What was happening before I got those headaches? Everybody's heard about chocolate, cheese, and red wine. But there are so many other factors as well. But you'll very often identify it. Then you've got to try and remove it. If you do get migraine, the simple thing is to start with soluble aspirin or soluble paracetamol and an antiemetic, which stops you feeling sick and helps the drugs to work quicker or move on to more effective treatments. What about a hormone headache? We've been hearing about that as well. Hormone headaches. Yeah, well, especially in women because of the cycle through the month with oestrogens, et cetera. And of course, a lot of women get headaches premenstrual. It's part of the premenstrual syndrome. Headaches in the menopause, headaches on the pill. Interesting that migraine can be improved during pregnancy. Pretty drastic treatment for you. It's very drastic treatment. The changing levels of hormones have these powerful effects on the body. So for hormone headache, is it just a normal treatment? Let's say you're on the pill and you get the headaches when you're on the pill-free days. You can take the pill continuously for a few months, and that can help it. Sometimes adding oestrogen before or after a period can ease the hormone. And of course, for menopausal headaches, HRT would help. What about something my wife suffers from greatly? Selective headaches. Is this to prevent you doing something? Well, I know she developed someone that suits her. That's basically... Women's prerogative, I think. When I was a kid, I had a lot of headaches, and I realized it was through not drinking water. Oh, yeah, yeah. Dehydration, yeah. Oh, dehydration. If it's heart and you've not been drinking, yeah, your headache, your field of ting, that's something that could just be dehydrated. Caring football's also contributed. We'll put all the information on our website as well.",4,3,4,2,3,2,4,5,2,2,2,2,4,4,2," 4

Explanation: The transcript of the YouTube video has a clear aim of discussing various types of headaches, their causes, symptoms, and treatments.

Therefore, the aims of the video are partially clear, and the score is 4."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims. It provides some information about different types of headaches, their causes, and treatments. However, it lacks a clear structure, and the medical expert sometimes seems unsure or unprepared. The video could be improved by providing more organized and detailed information, as well as by having a more confident and knowledgeable presenter."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses different types of headaches, including cluster headaches, which are severe and debilitating. The video also provides some information on the causes, symptoms, and treatments for these headaches. However, the video is not very focused on the topic and includes many unrelated discussions, such as hormone headaches, dehydration, and personal anecdotes. Therefore, the score is 4, indicating that the video is partially relevant."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author, Dr. Chris, mentions that they received information from Facebook users about various ailments, including headaches and migraines. However, the video does not provide any specific sources or references for the medical information about cluster headaches, their causes, symptoms, or treatments. The video also does not cite any sources for the information about migraines, hormone headaches, or other types of headaches mentioned. While the video does provide some general information about headaches and their treatments, it would be more informative if it included specific sources or references to support the claims made."," 3

Explanation: The transcript of the YouTube video is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The video discusses various types of headaches, including cluster headaches, migraines, hormone headaches, and other causes of headaches. The information provided is informative and helpful, but the transcript lacks proper formatting and organization, making it difficult to follow at times.

Therefore, the score is 3, indicating that the video is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The medical expert provides information about different types of headaches, their causes, symptoms, and treatments. However, the video also contains some subjective opinions and anecdotes, such as the mention of ""suicidal headaches"" and the comment about women's prerogative. Additionally, the video does not provide any references or sources to support the information presented."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as mentioning that the GP can treat cluster headaches with a group of drugs called tryptans, and that a headache that's persisting despite treatment should be checked out by a doctor. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive list of sources or organizations that can offer more information or support for people suffering from headaches and migraines."," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the presenter admits that they had never heard of cluster headaches before, indicating a lack of knowledge on the topic. Second, the presenter and their guest discuss the unknown causes of cluster headaches, stating that they know it involves a disturbance of blood supply and chemicals in the brain, but not the specifics. Third, the presenter mentions that the triggers for cluster headaches can vary from person to person, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause for each individual. Finally, the presenter acknowledges that there is no cure for cluster headaches, implying that there is still much to learn about the condition."," 2

The video does provide some information about the treatments for headaches and migraines, but it is not very detailed or comprehensive. It mentions tryptans for cluster headaches, paracetamol and ibuprofen for tension headaches, and self-diagnosis for migraines. However, it does not explain how these treatments work or provide any scientific rationale for their effectiveness. Additionally, it briefly mentions other treatments like oxygen therapy for cluster headaches, hormone therapy for hormone headaches, and continuous pill use for menstrual-related headaches, but again, without much detail or explanation. Therefore, the video only partially describes how each treatment works, and the score is 2."," 2

The video does provide some information about the benefits of treatments for headaches and migraines, but it is not comprehensive or detailed. The video mentions that cluster headaches can be treated with tryptans, tension headaches can be treated with paracetamol and ibuprofen, and migraines can be treated with soluble aspirin or paracetamol and antiemetics. However, the video does not explain how these treatments work, what the dosages are, or any potential side effects. Additionally, the video does not discuss other treatments for headaches, such as lifestyle changes, alternative therapies, or preventive measures. Therefore, the video only partially describes the benefits of each treatment."," 2

The video does partially describe the risks of some treatments, but it is not comprehensive or detailed enough to warrant a higher score. The video mentions that cluster headaches are severe and debilitating, but it does not provide much information on the risks associated with the treatments for cluster headaches. The video also briefly mentions that some treatments for migraines and hormone headaches can have side effects, but again, it does not go into detail about these risks. Overall, the video only partially addresses the question of whether it describes the risks of each treatment."," 2

The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used for cluster headaches. It only discusses the symptoms, causes, and treatments available for cluster headaches, as well as other types of headaches. The video does not mention the consequences of not seeking treatment or the progression of the condition without intervention."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions the severity of cluster headaches and how they can ruin lives, but it does not provide much detail on how the treatments (such as tryptans, oxygen, and specialist clinics) impact the quality of life for those suffering from cluster headaches. The video also briefly mentions other types of headaches and their treatments, but does not go into depth on how these treatments affect the overall quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the possible treatment choices for headaches and migraines. It mentions some treatments for specific types of headaches, such as cluster headaches (tryptans), tension headaches (paracetamol and ibuprofen), and hormone headaches (continuous pill intake or HRT). However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible treatment choices for different types of headaches, nor does it discuss alternative or complementary treatments. Therefore, the score is 4, indicating that the video is partially clear about the possible treatment choices."," 2

The video provides some information about different types of headaches, their symptoms, and possible treatments.

QNkU1VoDSF4,"With another type of headache called cluster headache, which is more common in men than women, these patients have absolutely horrible pain to the point where it's also called a suicide headache. The headache lasts 45 minutes to 3 hours max, whereas migraine goes 4 hours to 72, typically. But the cluster headache patients, even though it's a vascular headache, it starts from a different part of the brain, the hypothalamus, not the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which is the migraine generator. And these folk can't lie down. They walk. They cannot be comfortable anywhere. They will literally hit their heads against the wall to try to create pain that will have them shift their awareness of the pain away from the terrible pain of the cluster headache, which is described by, I'd say, 9 out of every 10 cluster patients I've ever seen as, quote, there's somebody inside my skull trying to push my eye out with a hot poker, end quote. And I say that, and what's fascinating to me is people that, to my knowledge, have never met themselves, met each other, have this same explanation, almost word for word with what I just said. So there's different types of headaches that have different ways of presenting, but the only commonality between tension-type headache and migraine is central sensitization after a while. And one last comment is that in migraine patients, when they develop central sensitization, we now know that they can also develop allodynia. Allodynia is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. And what's so fascinating in the migraine patient is migraine is a brain disease, okay? And you might have pain, and that's why it hurts to comb your hair when you have a migraine. That's the allodynia, but some people have what's called extra-cephalgic allodynia, or pain, in their back or their hands. So even though this is a brain disorder that's associated with a headache, they will get pain in their hands. And last comment is there's a percentage of patients, anywhere from 7 to 30 percent of patients, with migraine, that do not respond to atriptan, which is like a bullet. It hits the 5-HT, the serotonergic 1, B, D, and F subreceptors. And once a patient develops allodynia, atriptan will not work, and we weren't cognizant of that relationship until the last couple of years. Yes, there is. You'd use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory first, wait an hour, and then in not all, but a good percent of the patients, atriptan can be used and be successful to stop the headache or at least bring down the pain level significantly. That's pretty new information, new being the last five years. And what's so fascinating about migraine, migraine was written about for hundreds of years, and we're still learning even basic facts. I mean, we all knew that during migraine it hurt to run your hand through your hair or to comb your hair, but now we know that it's truly allodynia, which can only come from central sensitization.",3,3,4,3,4,3,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 3

They can sometimes have symptoms similar to migraines such as nausea, but they are different types of headaches. Cluster headaches are strictly one-sided headaches, typically around the eye, and these are very severe excruciating headaches lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours. Typically patients with cluster headache have what we call unilateral ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. This can be symptoms such as tearing of the eye, redness of the eye, swelling of the eyelid, runny nose or stuffy nose on the side of the headache.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,2,2," 4

WYP8ZFlDFDQ,"We've covered a lot of personal stories during the last eight seasons here on The Doctors, but this one hit close to home. Our staff was very concerned when it was revealed that one of our very own was struggling with an illness. Three, two, one, make your move. If you're in television, you should have as much fun as you can. Who's ready for some fun? Are you ready? And that's how I work. I am always trying to joke and have a good time. And I can't remember the last time I did that, these last two months. My name is Robert and I am the prop master for The Doctors. I shop and produce all the props that are used on the show. For the last eight years, I have suffered with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches can last anywhere from a minute to most of the day. They are extremely, extremely painful. It is unbelievable how debilitating these headaches are. I have seen him go from normal to curling up in a ball. It's so unpredictable. Almost every night, I have two or three cluster headaches. He will sleep on the couch. He has to prop himself up and then get up in the morning and sometimes finding him still in that same position. It's heartbreaking. In the mornings, I am completely exhausted. I have driven with these. I don't even know how I got through some of the days of work. It has been about a month and a half since I've had a full night's sleep. I have been to doctors, I've been to neurologists, and nothing really has helped. I do oxygen treatment now. It's the only thing to even make them bearable. I work with an amazing group of people. We are like a family. I'm blessed to be on a show called The Doctors. What's tough is that your workmates want to make you feel better. Having to stop and explain why I have an oxygen tank is really a rough part of that. Well, we're blessed to have Robert on our staff. And when we saw you struggling, we wanted to help. We actually sent Robert to see Dr. David Kudrow, director of the California Medical Clinic for headaches. Robert came in today with frequent, severe headaches. How long do they last? I had one this morning that was 15 minutes. About an hour after that, I had one that lasted four hours. Four hours. They have been two to three times a day. How long did the previous bout last? Three months. Always hit me in November. Sure. And always leave me somewhere in either January, February. Prior to that, were you headache-free? For three years. Before that was oxygen treatment as well. Are you taking any medications? We tried Imitrex. I was put on a steroid. Where do you feel it? It's been here. So you're pointing to your left side. Location is very important. I generally categorize headaches as either severe, which I call a number three headache, a moderately severe headache, I call that a number two, and I call a dull headache a number one headache, which does not typically interfere with ability to function. There's two different pains that I feel. A real intense throbbing. The other one is just a complete pain and tightness. And it's a pretty intense pain. Yeah. Robert's headaches were defined typically as number three headaches, or the most severe types. After seeing Robert in consultation, I'm pretty convinced that he does have, in fact, episodic cluster headache. This is a bizarre disorder. This is a truly bizarre disorder. Why every three years? In our audience is Dr. Kudrow. Obviously, Robert joins us as well.

However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help people dealing with cluster headaches. The video also introduces Dr. David Kudrow, who is an expert in headaches, but does not explicitly mention that he is available for consultation or that he can provide more information to viewers. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanas: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the narrator introduces Robert's case as a personal story and states that they are going to discuss it with Dr. Kudrow. This implies that there is some uncertainty about Robert's diagnosis and treatment. Second, Dr. Kudrow asks Robert several questions about the duration, frequency, and location of his headaches, which suggests that there is some uncertainty about the specific characteristics of his condition. Third, Dr. Kudrow states that Robert's headaches are ""episodic cluster headaches,"" which is a diagnosis that may not be immediately clear to the audience or even to Robert himself. Finally, the narrator asks Dr. Kudrow to explain what cluster headaches are and how they compare to other types of headaches, which indicates that there is some uncertainty about the general public's understanding of this disorder. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty, and I would rate it a 4 out of 5."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear explanation of how each treatment works. It only mentions oxygen treatment as a way to make the headaches bearable, but it does not explain how it works or what other treatments have been tried. The video focuses more on the personal story of Robert and his struggle with cluster headaches, rather than the treatments themselves."," 2

The video also does not discuss other treatment options or compare the effectiveness of different treatments for cluster headaches. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 3

Explanation: The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video focuses on Robert's experience with cluster headaches and his visit to Dr. Kudrow, who diagnosed him with episodic cluster headache. However, the video does not explore other possible treatments or mention other doctors' opinions. The video does show that Robert is using oxygen treatment, but it does not discuss other treatment options or compare their effectiveness."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but not enough to warrant a higher score. The video shares the personal story of Robert, who suffers from cluster headaches, and his experience with various treatments. However, the video does not provide much information on the different treatment options or their potential benefits and risks. The video also does not show a clear collaboration between Robert and his healthcare provider in making decisions about his care. Therefore, the video only partially supports shared decision-making.",{8},160
2xLTTU5iLZQ,"My name is Brighton Roper. I'm a licensed acupuncturist. Today we are in my office in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I'm going to be talking about the treatment of cluster headaches with acupuncture. Cluster headaches tend to occur in a cyclical pattern or cluster, and that's why they're given that name. And unfortunately for the patients who get this type of headache, the clusters can last for weeks at a time, and the patient can even have more than one bout of cluster headaches a year. Some characteristics of cluster headaches are that they can come on suddenly, affect one side of the face, and they can even cause eye pain or eye redness. In terms of Chinese medicine, three of the patterns that most closely fit with cluster headaches would be liver yang rising, liver fire rising, or blood stasis. So some of the points that would be commonly used to treat a cluster headache are actually at distal parts of the body, such as the foot. Liver two is a point on the liver channel that clears liver heat and fire and keeps it from rising. Kidney three. Large intestine four is actually the command point of the face, and it will help direct the treatment to the head and face where the headache is. San jiao five. Good for alleviating pain. And some points in the local area. Gallbladder eight, and tai yang, which is an extra point.

Sorry I'm really hot and sweaty before I go back in the office I thought a really quick video on acute management of cluster headache What do you know for a medical exam question or a medical exam role play now in primary care? Generally, we're not going to see that many acute cluster headaches I tend to go to any for example But you need to know how to manage it if it comes up in an exam question now cluster headaches We've got another video somewhere on YouTube about how it presents the key features, you know, natural red water etc So have a look at that video and if you need a top up on that But how do you manage it now according to nice CKS? There are two things that generally are focused on first for management of plus a headache acutely number one oxygen and number two Sumatriptan, let's start with sumatriptan first So sumatriptan can be given intranasally, but I'm going to talk about the subcutaneous dose subcutaneous or subcut is what we'll focus on here So the dose for subcut sumatriptan in adult is six milligrams given Acutely when the headache is presenting now you can repeat another six milligrams after at least one hour But not if it hasn't responded to the first dose only if it recurs at that time So if it's not responding to the first six milligram dose, you can't give a second six milligrams The maximum you can give in a day is 12 milligrams of subcut Sumatriptan and the dose for intranasal is slightly different. Have a look at nice CKS for that This is just subcut sumatriptan. The other thing that you give is oxygen unless it's contraindicated 100% oxygen will help with the acute management as per nice CKS What do you not give in the acute management cluster headache? Do not give paracetamol do not give non-storied lanteflourities do not give opioids and do not give oral triptans They're not suggested in nice CKS for the management of acute cluster headache Hope this helps much more like this on our YouTube channel Facebook channel Twitter Instagram, dr underscore omen underscore Aurora or dr I'm in a row depending on what channel you're using subscribe share like ask for any other videos that you need doing So much more different types of headaches temporal arteritis migraine subdural got videos of all of these things I have a look at those if it can help in your medical exam questions Online courses face face courses virtual courses audio courses on our website Aurora medical education code UK Remember two things when it comes to cluster headache management acutely according to nice CKS number one sumatriptan subcut number two 100% oxygen hope this helps near the hashtag campus will pass hashtag.

PrbIkzAX5xc,"Hi, this is Tom from zero to finals dot com. In this video I'm going to be going through cluster headaches and you can find written notes on this topic at zero to finals dot com slash cluster headaches or in the neurology section of the zero to finals medicine book. So let's jump straight in. Cluster headaches cause severe and unbearable unilateral headaches usually around the eye. And they're called cluster headaches because they come in clusters of attacks and then disappear for a while. For example, a patient might have three to four attacks a day for a week or month followed by a pain free period lasting one to two years. Attacks last between 15 minutes and three hours and they can be triggered by things like alcohol, strong smells or exercise. A typical patient that you might see in your exams who's got cluster headaches is a 30 to 50 year old male smoker coming in with severe pain around one eye. So what are the symptoms? Well cluster headaches are often described as the most severe and intolerable pain in the world. They're sometimes referred to as suicide headaches due to the severity of the pain. And symptoms are all typically unilateral with a red swollen and watery eye, pupil constriction which is called meiosis, eyelid drooping which is called ptosis, nasal discharge and there can be facial sweating on one side. So what are the treatment options for cluster headaches? Well there's the acute management which aims to improve the symptoms of the cluster headache at the time and this can be with triptans, for example sumatriptan injected subcutaneously at the start of the headache. Another option which often comes up in exams is high flow 100% oxygen which is breathed for 15 to 20 minutes to try and improve the symptoms of the headache. And patients are often given oxygen to keep at home to use during the headaches to help with the symptoms. So my top tip at this point is to remember that oxygen is used to treat the symptoms of a cluster headache and this is quite a unique fact that can be brought up in exams. There's also options for prophylaxis to prevent the cluster headaches from occurring and this can be things like verapamil, lithium and prednisolone can actually be used for a short course for two to three weeks to try and break the cycle during a cluster of headache attacks. So thanks for watching, I hope you found this video helpful. If you did, don't forget there's plenty of other resources on the Zero to Find All website including loads and loads of notes on various different topics that you might cover in medical school with specially made illustrations. There's also a whole test section where you can find loads of questions to test your knowledge and see where you're up to in preparation for your exams. There's also a blog where I share a lot of my ideas about a career in medicine and tips on how to have success as a doctor. And if you want to help me out on YouTube, you can always leave me a thumbs up, give me a comment or even subscribe to the channel so that you can find out when the next videos are coming out.

dM26LYviWhY,"Hello again everyone, my name is Damian and I'm a headache clinician at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help. So feel free to leave a comment below or message us directly or you can give us a call on 1800 HEADACHE to get started on treating your headaches and migraines. Thanks very much for listening in today guys, I'll see you in the next video.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,2,2,4,4,3," 4

However, the video does not explicitly mention any sources of information other than the author's own knowledge and experience. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a detailed explanation of cluster headaches, their symptoms, causes, and treatments. However, it does not cover the other three types of headaches mentioned in the video, which might be relevant for a complete understanding of the topic. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it provides a comprehensive overview of cluster headaches, their symptoms, and possible causes. However, it does have a slight bias towards the treatment offered at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, as the video ends with a promotional message encouraging viewers to contact the clinic for treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the phone number to call for help (1800 HEADACHE) and the invitation to leave a comment or message. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help people suffering from these headaches. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the speaker mentions that the cause of cluster headaches was previously unknown and that recent research has found a potential contributing factor, but it is not definitively proven. Second, the speaker discusses the effect of tryptans on blood vessels and the brain stem, but notes that the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Third, the speaker claims that their clinic can treat cluster headaches without medication or surgery, but does not provide any specific evidence or details about the effectiveness of their non-invasive treatment. Therefore, the video contains some areas of uncertainty, but it is not overwhelmingly uncertain or speculative."," 3

Explanation: The video provides a general overview of cluster headaches, their symptoms, and possible causes. However, it does not describe how each treatment works in detail. It only briefly mentions that tryptans can help reduce blood vessel dilatation and inhibit signals from the cervical afferents, but does not explain the exact mechanisms or processes involved in the treatment. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 3

Explanation: The video does not describe the benefits of each treatment for cluster headaches. It only mentions that tryptans are effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough, but does not explain how they work or their benefits. The video also introduces a new treatment method for sensitized brain stem, but does not elaborate on its benefits or how it works. Therefore, the score is 3, meaning 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment for cluster headaches. It only mentions that tryptans are effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough, but does not discuss any potential side effects or risks associated with this medication. The video also introduces a non-invasive treatment for sensitized brain stem, but does not explain any risks or potential complications of this treatment either. Therefore, the video only partially addresses the risks of treatments for cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It mainly focuses on explaining the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for cluster headaches. The speaker also briefly mentions other types of headaches and their prevalence. However, the video does not provide any information on the potential consequences or outcomes for those who do not seek treatment for their cluster headaches."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains that cluster headaches are severe and debilitating, and that treatment can help alleviate the pain without the need for medication or surgery. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different treatment options or their impact on quality of life, so it is not a complete description."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The speaker mentions that medications such as tryptans have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough, but also discusses recent research that suggests a sensitized brain stem as the primary contributing factor to cluster headaches. The speaker then explains that treatment at their clinic does not require medication or surgery and is non-invasive and safe. This indicates that there are at least two possible treatment choices for cluster headaches: medication and addressing the sensitized brain stem."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about cluster headaches, their symptoms, and possible causes. However, it does not explicitly discuss shared decision-making or involve the patient in the decision-making process.

7l7BvjS9b94,"You want to put your head in a vice. I've done everything from pace to cry from the pain. It would be easy to think that Stephen Burley's description of his cluster headaches are an exaggeration, but when you look at drawings online from cluster headache sufferers, you start to get a sense of the intensity of the pain. Your eye is going to explode. Steve learned they're called cluster headaches because they occur in groups every day for weeks or months, then disappear for extended periods, which is different from migraines. Cluster pain is short. The attacks are almost always less than 90 minutes. Migraine attacks last four to seventy-two hours with nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. Cluster travels with redness of the eye, drooping of the lid. Now there may be a non-drug, non-interventional way to get relief from cluster headaches. It's a small battery-powered external nerve stimulator called GammaCore that's used as soon as a cluster headache comes on. The attacks are incredibly intense, but also brief, so giving a drug that takes a couple of hours to kick in like an oral medication is sort of pointless. The GammaCore device is placed over the area of the neck where the vagus nerve travels. It delivers mild electrical stimulation through the skin to the vagus. The impulses are thought to travel up to the brain stem where they short-circuit the headache. A couple of double-blind studies that show a large number of people are pain-free 15 minutes after treating with the vagus nerve stimulator. The GammaCore has just been cleared by the FDA, so it probably won't be available in the U.S. until this fall. Price has not yet been set, but it is expected to be covered by insurance.

ms281RCYuB4,"In this video we will take a look at the characteristics and presentation of a rare but debilitating form of headache: the cluster headache. Enroll in our online course now! Link is in the video description. Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors! Headaches can manifest on their own but are also a very common symptom in neck pain patients as more than 60% of patients with a primary neck pain complaint report of having concordant episodes of headache. Therefore, it's essential to find out what kind of headache the patient is suffering from. to start off, let's differentiate between primary and secondary types of headaches. But what does this mean? Simply put, primary headaches are a disease themselves, whereas in secondary headaches, the headache is a symptom of another condition. So primary headaches would be migraines, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Secondary-type headaches are headaches caused by tumors, hemorrhage, other trauma ,TMJ dysfunction, substance overuse or neck pain aka the cervicogenic headache. Now, let's take a closer look at cluster headaches which are primary-type headaches.- Cluster headaches have a one-year prevalence of 53 per 100,000 people around the world with men being affected around 3 to 4 times more often than women at the age of 20 to 40. In order for a headache to qualify as cluster headache it has to fulfill certain criteria: A. at least 5 attacks need to fulfill criteria B-D. B. an untreated episode lasts 15 to 180 minutes and shows a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and or temporal pain. C. it matches either or both of the following: 1. at least one of the following signs and symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and/or ptosis. 2. A sense of restlessness or agitation. There are reports of patients pacing back and forth through the room banging their heads due to the severe pain. D. It occurs with a frequency between one every other day and eight per day. Tools you can use to assess the impact of a headache on your patient are, for example, the HIT-6 questionnaire which you can find in the video description down below. Also note that it can be difficult for our patient to answer all of the questions on duration, intensity and characteristics of their headache during your initial assessment. Therefore asking them to complete a headache diary can help in the assessment and management of the headache and you should be aware that there can be an overlap between multiple headaches disorders. Okay, you can check out another headache presentation on the left. Please check the links in the video description down below to learn more about our online course, our ebook and mobile app. Give this video a thumbs up before you leave, subscribe if you're new here, and as usual this was Andreas for Physiotutors, I'll see you in another video, bye!",3,3,3,3,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 3

YD6q9EXyvZA,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Jacobs. I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

Explanation: The video has a clear aim of demonstrating the effectiveness of the ASTR treatment for jaw pain, headaches, and scar tissue. However, the transcript is long and contains many details that are not directly related to the main aim. The video could be shorter and more focused on the main goal, which is to show how ASTR can help with these symptoms."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially successful in achieving its aims. The doctor demonstrates his technique and provides some relief to the patient. However, the video is not very clear about the specific aims of the treatment, the underlying causes of the patient's symptoms, or the scientific evidence supporting the technique. The video also includes some irrelevant or unnecessary information, such as the doctor's personal story, hair care tips, and a promotion for his online class."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant to the topic of physical therapy and advanced soft tissue release (ASTR) specialty. However, it is not directly relevant to the question of whether the video is helpful for understanding the causes and treatments of headaches. The video is more focused on demonstrating the ASTR technique and its effects on the patient's jaw and scar tissue. While it does mention some possible causes of headaches, such as clenching and grinding teeth, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying mechanisms or other treatment options. Therefore, the video is partially relevant, but not completely."," 2

Explanation: The video is clear about the author's expertise as a doctor of physical therapy and the inventor of ASTR specialty. However, it does not provide any clear information about the sources of information used to compile the publication, other than the author's personal experience and knowledge.

The video itself may have a date or other context, but the transcript does not include that information. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 2

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because the doctor is promoting his own treatment (ASTR) throughout the video. He is not presenting any alternative treatments or discussing the potential risks or limitations of his own treatment. He is also using his own personal story to establish credibility, which may not be relevant to the patient's specific condition. Additionally, the video is more of a testimonial than an educational or informative video, as it focuses on one specific patient's experience and does not provide general information that would be useful to a wider audience."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the link to subscribe to the channel for helpful tips on how to relieve pain, and the link for healthcare providers to register for ASTR online class. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could offer more in-depth information or support for the topic discussed. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects. First, the doctor is not sure if the patient's headaches are solely caused by the clicking jaw or if there are other factors involved. Second, the doctor is not certain if the scar tissue will go away completely or if it will recur if the patient continues to clench or grind their teeth. Third, the doctor does not explicitly state how the ASTR treatment works or what the scientific basis for it is, although they mention a 4-year study and 400 studies. Therefore, the video partially addresses areas of uncertainty, but not completely."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear description of how each treatment works. It only mentions the inventor's own invention, ASTR specialty, and briefly discusses the patient's symptoms and how the treatment seems to help. The video does not explain the underlying mechanisms or principles of other treatments that might be relevant for the patient's condition."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatment. The doctor explains how the treatment works by breaking down scar tissue and relieving headaches and jaw pain. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits of the treatment, nor does it compare it to other treatments or provide evidence of its effectiveness."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment. It only focuses on the inventor's own treatment method (ASTR) and its benefits for the patient in the video. There is no mention of other treatments or their risks."," 4

Explanation: The video does partially describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The patient describes his symptoms, such as headaches, teeth grinding, and ear ringing, which have been present for years. The doctor also explains that the scar tissue and muscle tightness caused by clenching and grinding can lead to headaches and other symptoms. However, the video does not explicitly state that these symptoms would worsen or continue without treatment, so it does not fully describe the consequences of no treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video describes the treatment choices for a patient with jaw clicking, headaches, and teeth grinding. The doctor explains how the treatment (ASTR) works to break down scar tissue and reduce symptoms. The patient reports improvement in their headache and overall quality of life. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different treatment options or their outcomes, so it is only partially informative about how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor explains that there is a specific treatment called ASTR that he invented and that he uses it to help the patient. However, he also mentions that there are other ways to prevent and decrease clenching, which implies that there might be other treatments or approaches to address the issue. Additionally, he refers to a 4-year study and over 400 studies that support the ASTR treatment model, which suggests that there might be other research or evidence for different treatment options."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as the doctor asks the patient about their symptoms and listens to their feedback.

SnE0xjsNMDo,"Oh Oh Oh Oh Cluster headaches is one of the most excruciating types of pain There is this rare condition affects just around nine and one million people which means that there are about 500 sufferers in the UK alone This is a documentary to help raise awareness and help people to understand the level of pain suffer goes through every time they have an attack My stepfather Mike has been a sufferer for over eight years now So little is known about this condition even in the medical profession And it's because of this that he is only being diagnosed and treated for the last five years Mike like so many others has to live with this unbearably painful condition for the rest of his life After some extensive research into cluster headaches I went on a personal journey with Mike to find out what he's going through and Hopefully this short documentary will allow you to finally be able to express his true I see and when when you were mistake one mistake when you were I think your tablets in time Start getting spikes or muzziness Late I am at the moment. I'm just being very muscly, okay Okay I've been suffering from what I thought was toothache for about five months I went down to see the doctor and literally begged her to make the headache stop because I couldn't take anymore She asked me what sort of pain it was how I felt Thought it might be migraines, but asked me to come back in a couple of days time She bless her took the time to investigate my complaint and diagnosed me with something called cluster headaches So You've you've missed your tablet I have I am two hours late to take me tablets that are due to take them six o'clock And it's quite a strict regime. I have to take them four times a day If I don't this is how I get at the moment. I'm feeling very Muzzy not quite with it So The next stage from this will be if it's if it starts fighting so the only way around that is oxygen I see The oxygen helps relieve the headaches I use it either when I'm coming down or if it's not that bad I Have high flow oxygen delivered at a rate of 15 liters a minute I Have free oxygen cylinders by my bed During an episode I will typically get through three cylinders in a week, so I'm on oxygen for at least an hour in a week Sometimes I want somebody there. I don't want to be held or touched. I just want somebody in the room because they scare me Pain I Can't describe the pain. It's it is genuinely beyond words The only way that I can describe a cluster headache is by comparing it to an ice cream brain freeze Now that might last 10 15 seconds and seem like a lifetime a cluster headache It's 10 times more painful and will last in my case for 20 minutes at a time it feels as if there is a Piece of string or a metal rod running from the top of my head Down through my eye and into my jaw and it feels as if somebody three foot taller than me is pulling it It's as if my in the inside of my head is trying to explode When one strikes it's quite easy to see My eyes will start watering my left eye closes and I am going to be curled up in a ball All I want is to pull this beast out of my head I Want to rip the top of my head off and stick a spooning until I get that bit of my head my brain out That's how bad it is The Beast doesn't visit just once It's as I said my normally come at three or four times a day. I can almost set my clockwork I will get one between half past one and half past two in the morning I will get one between half past five and half past six in the morning I will get one between half past nine and half past ten in the morning and I'll get one between two o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon This does knowing when it's gonna come scare you or does it help you to? Prepare for when they're gonna come or like take your tablets or in advance It It doesn't scare me scare is probably the the wrong word It does drive me to despair After I've had I mean my episodes my last one lasted nine months now after about two months of Severely interrupted sleep of absolutely chronic pain of my legs being so sore from injections That I couldn't find somewhere on my legs that didn't hurt injecting it then I You can't prepare for even knowing or being Sure that I'm gonna get an attack an episode the beast is gonna come and visit me you can't do anything about it When the episode does stop the next rather than relief it's then concerned when the next episode will start Do you think enough people know about This condition to warrant, you know more research being put into it to try and help prevent it You could probably ask a thousand people at random What a cluster headache is and nobody would be able to tell you If I had a pound for everybody that said oh I get those and I just take a paracetamol and I'm fine I could retire Painkillers do not touch them None at all no painkillers no painkillers I've been over-the-counter Restriction and I've actually been on hospital strength painkillers and they do not Nobody's heard of cluster headaches tell people you suffer from migraines and you'll get a Wince of sympathy you tell me you got a cluster headache and they tell you to take a paracetamol Oh Oh You",2,3,4,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2,2,2,2," 2

Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 5

Explanas: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the narrator states that ""so little is known about this condition even in the medical profession."" This implies that there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about cluster headaches among healthcare professionals. Second, the video shows the personal journey of the narrator and his stepfather, who have to live with this painful condition for the rest of their lives, and how they struggle to find effective treatments. The video also mentions that the only way to relieve the pain is by using oxygen, which is not a permanent solution. Third, the video highlights the difficulty of predicting and preparing for the attacks, as the narrator says, ""you can't do anything about it"" and ""you can't prepare for even knowing or being sure that I'm gonna get an attack."" This suggests that there is a lack of certainty and control over the condition and its management. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty in the context of cluster headaches and their treatment."," 2

MxwVsT9vivg,"Okay, I want to share with you what the nature of my cluster headaches are like. They always start with a slight burn in the nostril. That's how I know it's a cluster headache. There's no other feeling in this world like the beginning of a cluster headache. So if I haven't had headaches for a while and I'm driving down the road and all of a sudden I feel a burn in my nostril, I don't waste a second getting some medicine in me quickly because we're getting ready to go through another episode of cluster headaches. Once I feel that burn, then it's always kind of a stabbing pain like over my eye or behind my eye. It'll just be like a pulsating stab just for a half a second or so and then there'll be an interval in between 30 seconds, a minute, minute and a half and then I'll start feeling another stab. And the cluster headache will just begin to ramp its way up and it happens very quickly. Within about 10 minutes, I can be in debilitating pain. So once I begin to feel those pulses, then it starts usually seeding more in the eye area and the only way that I can begin to describe what it feels like is that if you grabbed your arm and you just pinched it as hard as you could and just twisted it and you held it there. If you take that pain and you multiply it by about two times, that's what it's like having a cluster headache. It's like somebody's just pinching your eye and they won't stop pinching it and the pain is excruciating and that can last all the way up to an hour and a half. So it works its way into the eye, it builds in intensity and then the pain starts going all the way up in the top of my head and down into my neck and a lot of times it's a stabbing, like pulsating pain where all I can do is just kind of moan and groan and you know I'll say Jesus relieved the pain in one breath and then I'll say the worst first word that will come out of my mouth in the next because the pain is just, it's unbearable. I've been on the floor just screaming and hollering before. Anyway, that's what a cluster headache is like for me. If I don't get the medicine in me quick enough, it starts with a slight burn, I feel some pulsating up here, it begins to work into my eye and begins to pinch gradually slowly until it gets into a deep seated pinching pain and then it works its way up in my head and I feel throbbing all in my jaw area and my neck and in my head.",4,2,4,1,4,2,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,2," 4

xCb_BPBh5dQ,"Hey, what would you think if you woke up in the middle of the night, say like 2.06, and you felt like somebody had taken the worst torture device in there and trying to pull your eye out of your head from the back through the top of your head. Okay, say like you did that. And then after an hour or so it goes away. Then the next night, 2.06, the person with the device is back, yanking your eye out through the top of your head again. You get up, you roll around, you grab your head like you're going crazy, and then 15-20 minutes later it gets slightly bearable. And then after about an hour or so it sort of just goes away like it was never there. You start to think, oh hey, I guess maybe I have a brain tumor and I'm about to die, I better get my things in order. So anyway, you kind of recover, everything's fine. So you go to bed the next night, 2.06, your friend's back with the tool. So this goes on for like 5 days and then just stops. Never forget about it, but it stops so it's not a big deal anymore. So then you go about your business and a year later, a year later, calendar year later, 2.06, you wake up with excruciating pain and your friend is back after a year in Provence or something. Anyway, and it starts all over again. Those are what are called cluster headaches and I'm one of the lucky recipients of the cluster headache. So it took me a long time to figure out what this was. The weird thing about them is they're harmless. The most excruciating pain known to man. Mostly men get them, mostly men in their 20s, 30s and 40s and then a lot of times they just go away on their own. Some women do get them and the women that have got them have said they're far more painful and more severe than anything related to childbirth. This is some serious pain I'm telling you about. Once you've experienced this, there's nothing you can imagine that's more excruciating. The nickname for them is also suicide headaches and they've shown up throughout history and people have known about them for a long time. They don't seem to have any ill effects and they don't seem to cause any lasting problems which is sort of shocking considering how excruciating these things are. Literally a grown man rolling around on the floor, tears coming out of your eyes, your nose is running just out of excruciating pain and it's so painful you cannot even think. It's impossible to even form a thought. You're lucky if you can get into the bathroom and slug down a couple of aspirin in hopes. I don't even know if that helps. I'm a mild sufferer. So there's people that have chronic cluster or suicide headaches. So my sympathy is out to y'all. I hope this helps enlighten somebody out there. But I would say if you are having any problem like this, go see a doctor. But look into what cluster headaches are first so you can kind of explain that to him because you don't want this to be something worse. But there's things a lot more deadly. Over and out.

iVWa9Lqf8jE,"Hi, my name's Matt. I'm 43 years old. I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it. Unsuccessfully for me. It might help other people. When you go to the doctors. Do not leave that doctor until they've prescribed you the injections. Or these. You must have the injections and the oxygen. Get an appointment straight away. A neurologist. I know it takes forever. But once diagnosed. They can't refuse to give you these injections. When I pick up a repeat prescription. I get these. I get ten of these. Sometimes I get twelve. I'm not paying £7.80 a throw. Whatever it is for just two of these. I'm going in and picking up a bag of ten. And I'm surviving. Peace out people. Love you lots.",2,2,2,2,3,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2," 2

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video seems to be about showing people how to split EpiPen injections to get more doses out of them.

Additionally, the speaker promotes an unproven remedy (Veraptamol) and advises viewers to not leave the doctor's office without getting the injections, which is not relevant to the aim of the video."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it provides some information on how to split injections for people who suffer from cluster headaches. However, the video is not very clear or professional, and it contains a lot of irrelevant information, such as the personal story of the speaker, the mention of Veraptamol, and the advice on how to get prescriptions. The video could be more relevant if it focused only on the topic of splitting injections and provided more details on the benefits and risks of this method."," 2

Explanation: The video is clear about the author's personal experience and method of splitting injections to manage his cluster headaches. However, it does not provide any clear information about the sources of information that the author used to compile the publication. The author mentions watching a show called ""Ouch!"" and receiving EpiPens from a friend who is diabetic, but these sources are not explained or elaborated upon. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 3

Explanation: The video is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript is about a person who suffers from cluster headaches and explains how to split an EpiPen to get more injections. The video is informative and provides some useful tips for people who suffer from similar conditions. However, the video is not very clear in terms of the production quality, as the audio is not very stable, and the video quality is not very high. Additionally, the transcript is quite long and detailed, which might make it difficult for some viewers to follow along. Therefore, the score is 3, meaning 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The speaker shares his personal experience and method of splitting injections to manage his cluster headaches. However, the video lacks any information about other treatment options, potential side effects, or risks associated with splitting injections. The speaker also seems to have a strong emotional attachment to the topic, which may influence his perspective."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as mentioning the YouTube channel Ouch! and suggesting to email or message the creator for more questions. However, the video is mostly focused on demonstrating how to split the injections and does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help people suffering from cluster headaches. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the speaker is unsure why some EpiPens have more doses than others. Second, the speaker is unsure why he has started receiving the pens instead of the regular EpiPen. Third, the speaker is unsure if the method he describes for splitting the injections is safe or effective. Finally, the speaker is unsure if the medication Veraptamol will help others with cluster headaches. These areas of uncertainty make the video less clear and more open to interpretation, so the score is 4."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe how each treatment works. It only shows how to split an EpiPen injection to get more doses out of it. The video does not explain the mechanism of action, dosage, or side effects of the treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the benefits of each treatment. It only explains how to split an EpiPen injection to get more doses out of it. The speaker does not mention any benefits or advantages of this method, nor does he compare it to other treatments. He also does not provide any evidence or data to support his claims. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment. It only explains how to split an EpiPen injection to get more doses out of it. The risks of using an EpiPen, such as potential allergic reactions or side effects, are not discussed."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only explains how the person splits the injections to get more usage out of them. The transcript does not mention any consequences or outcomes of not receiving treatment."," 2

The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The speaker shares his experience of splitting injections to get more relief from his cluster headaches. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the different treatment options or their impact on quality of life. It mainly focuses on one specific method of using injections, which may not be applicable or effective for everyone."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the possible treatment choices. The main treatment choice discussed in the video is splitting the injections from an EpiPen to get more doses out of it. However, the video does not explore other possible treatments or mention that this is just one option among others."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about how the person with cluster headaches manages his condition by splitting the injections, but it does not involve any discussion or consideration of different treatment options or shared decision-making with a healthcare provider. The video is mainly focused on the person's personal experience and tips, rather than providing evidence-based information or involving the viewer in the decision-making process.",set(),171
Q8DBJisYeXY,"Hey everybody, I'd like to talk to you today about headache. I have friends who get headaches, really bad ones, migraine headaches, and some of them even get these cluster headaches where they feel like they want to beat their head against a concrete wall just to stop the headache. Well, I've got a friend, my old next door neighbor, who's the world premiere expert on headache, Dr. Bernstein, and he told me some secrets. Now look, he told me, and I'm just telling you, I'm not a doctor, but I told my friends about these headache cures and they keep texting me and emailing me saying, this headache cure saved my life, how come I've never heard about it? The reason you haven't heard about it is because the medical world isn't going to make any money off these. So here they are. First off, if you already have a headache, Coca-Cola, caffeine, and carbonation together, great for headaches, but better yet, you want to stop this headache when you feel the aura. There's a certain feeling somebody gets, they know after they've had migraines before in cluster headaches, they can feel it coming earlier before the headache starts, the little clue it's coming. When you feel that, grab a rag, a cold rag, put it behind the back of your neck. Close your eyes and sit in a dark room. That's one thing. Here's the other thing. Oxygen. 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. Once you feel the onset, the early precursor to that headache, 100% oxygen, 10 minutes, your headache will either not come or it will come greatly reduced. So let me know what you think. And I hope you feel better.",2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,1," 2

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video seems to be about sharing some headache remedies, but it is not very informative or professional. The speaker is not a doctor and does not provide any evidence or sources for the information. The video also includes some irrelevant details, such as the speaker's personal connection to Dr. Bernstein and the conspiracy theory about the medical world not wanting to share these remedies. The video could be improved by providing more accurate and reliable information, as well as a clearer structure and purpose."," 2

Explanation: The video does not achieve its aims because it lacks credibility and scientific evidence. The speaker is not a medical expert, and the information provided is not backed by any reputable sources. The video also does not provide a clear structure or organization, making it difficult to follow and understand. The advice given, such as using Coca-Cola and oxygen, may help some people, but it is not a comprehensive or evidence-based solution for headache relief."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses headaches and some potential remedies. However, the credibility of the information is questionable, as the speaker is not a medical expert and the source of the advice is a friend who is a headache expert. Additionally, the speaker claims that the medical world is suppressing these remedies, which is a conspiracy theory. The video could be helpful for some viewers, but it is not a reliable or comprehensive source of information on headaches."," 1

Explanation: The video is not clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication, other than the author. The author claims to have a friend who is an expert on headaches, Dr. Bernstein, but does not provide any evidence or citation to support this claim. Additionally, the author does not mention any other sources of information, such as scientific studies or articles, that were used to compile the publication. Therefore, the score is 1, meaning 'no.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is not very clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The speaker claims to have a friend who is a world premiere expert on headache, but does not provide any evidence or credentials to support this claim. Additionally, the speaker is not a doctor and is sharing advice that they have not verified with a medical professional. The advice given, such as using Coca-Cola and oxygen, may not be safe or effective for everyone and could potentially cause harm. The speaker also implies that the medical world is hiding these ""cures"" to make money, which is a conspiracy theory that lacks evidence. Overall, the video is not a reliable source of information on headache treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because it presents only one perspective on headache treatment, which is the speaker's friend's advice. The speaker does not mention any other sources or scientific evidence to support the claims made by his friend. Additionally, the speaker's tone is informal and he is not a medical expert, which may lead to misinterpretation of the information provided."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about headache relief, but it does not mention any additional sources of support or information. The speaker claims to have learned these ""secrets"" from a friend who is a headache expert, but does not provide any evidence or references to support this claim. The video also does not mention any medical studies or research that support the effectiveness of the suggested remedies. Therefore, the video only partially provides details of additional sources of support and information."," 2

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in two ways. First, the speaker is not a medical expert and is sharing information from a friend who is an expert. This introduces some uncertainty about the validity of the information being shared. Second, the speaker mentions that the medical world is not going to make any money off the headache cures, which implies that these cures may not be widely accepted or proven. Therefore, the video partially refers to areas of uncertainty."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear description of how each treatment works. It mentions Coca-Cola, caffeine, and carbonation as a remedy for headaches, but does not explain the mechanism behind it. It also suggests using a cold rag behind the neck and sitting in a dark room, but does not explain why this helps. Finally, it mentions oxygen therapy, but does not provide any details on how it works or why it is effective. Therefore, the video only partially describes how each treatment works, and the score is 2."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a comprehensive description of the benefits of each treatment. It only mentions two treatments: using a cold rag behind the neck and sitting in a dark room, and using 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. The video does not explain how these treatments work, nor does it provide any evidence or research to support their effectiveness. Additionally, the video's credibility is questionable, as it is presented by someone who is not a medical expert and claims that the medical world is suppressing these headache cures. Therefore, the video only partially describes the benefits of each treatment, and the score is 2."," 1

Explanation: The video does not describe the risks of each treatment. It only mentions two headache cures without discussing any potential side effects or risks associated with them. The video is mainly focused on sharing personal anecdotes and opinions rather than providing a balanced and informative discussion about headache treatments."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only provides two possible treatments for headaches: Coca-Cola, caffeine, and carbonation, and 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. The video does not mention the consequences of not using any treatment for headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a comprehensive description of how treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It only mentions two specific treatments for headaches: Coca-Cola, caffeine, and carbonation, and 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. While these treatments may help alleviate headaches, they do not address the broader impact of headache treatment choices on a person's overall well-being and quality of life. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is not very clear about the fact that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The speaker only mentions two specific treatments: using a cold rag behind the neck and sitting in a dark room, and using 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. While the speaker does mention that these are secrets from an expert, they do not explicitly state that these are not the only possible treatments or that other treatments may exist. Therefore, the video is only partially clear about the possibility of multiple treatment choices."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide support for shared decision-making because it is not based on evidence-based medicine or expert opinions.

R_ienaIhKO0,"I don't have any phobias. I don't mind spiders. I think snakes are great. Being in the dark, funny noises, nothing like that particularly scares me. But I am scared of the beast. I currently work in London at a place called the Shell building. Which I am very very fortunate in that the Shell building is no more than a three minute walk from London Waterloo terminal. My role is planning manager which means I spend maybe two days a week sat in front of a computer analysing all the information I've got. I love coming home mainly because I love my wife. So I know that as I'm walking up the road through the path, through the woods, I know I'm only a couple of minutes away from a hug with my wife. She is the mainstay of my day. We've got a great house. It's an end of terrace, three bedroom, nice quiet road. It's great. It's a lovely place to live. It's a nice area. Now I live in Chandler's Ford. It's a much much bigger place but it's got that same homely friendly atmosphere. My parents are both in their 80s. My mum has just had this major surgery. Dad doesn't drive, has never driven apart from driving people mad or being a backseat driver. So I take them and do their weekly shopping with them. My brother as well as being my brother is my best friend. And like good friends do, we enjoy a pint. So we've got a very very good real ale pub a few miles from where he lives. So I pick them up and we go and have a pint. It does us both good. I love real ales and this is a dying breed this pub. It's a proper pub. It has real ales and it's got a dark horse. It's everything I want in a pub. I spend as much time as I can with my wife. We're fortunate that they've got very similar tastes. She will come motor racing with me to watch the racing and to make sure that I don't get into trouble. And I will go to her to visually impaired cricket. And a few years ago when they set up a cricket team they asked the volunteers to help. I had time on my hands so I went along. I'm undergoing training as a scorer. My wife is one of the coaches. I go along and hopefully add the numbers up. I knew that having a profession that involved numbers one day would drag me down and here we are. Out of nowhere I get a bright shiny headache that starts off in my left eye. And I know within a matter of seconds I'm going to be a necky. My left eye will close and droop. My eye will be watering cochlearly as if I'm crying on one side of my face. But the obvious give away is the fact that I'm going to be curled up in the fetal position. Wrapping my arms around my head and curled up. Stamping, stamping my feet. Hitting whatever is near me. And I hit things so that my hand hurts and takes my mind off the pain. If I am fortunate enough to be able to move then I carry an injection kit with me. And it is... It's a miracle because if I can manage to load the injection and if I can manage to inject myself, within five minutes the pain will be gone. If I can't I'm looking at 20 to 30 minutes of seriously, seriously wishing I was dead. Which is why they're called suicide headaches. I don't have any phobias. But I am scared of the beast. I can't hide from it. I can't run from it. It's with me all the time and I carry it with me. That's what the beast has done to me. That's what the beast has done to me.",2,2,2,1,4,2,1,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1," 2

Explanation: The aims of the video are not clear. The transcript is a mix of personal anecdotes and information about the speaker's condition, but there is no clear focus or main message. The speaker mentions a ""beast"" several times, but it is not clear what this refers to or how it relates to the rest of the transcript. The video might be intended to raise awareness about a specific condition or to share the speaker's personal experiences, but without more context, it is difficult to determine the purpose of the video."," 2

Explanation: The video does not achieve its aims because it is not clear what the aims are. The transcript is a personal story about the speaker's life, but it does not provide any information or guidance on a specific topic or issue. The speaker mentions having a medical condition, but does not explain it or offer any advice or support for others who might have similar experiences. The video might be intended as a personal testimony or a conversation starter, but it does not serve as a helpful or informative resource for viewers."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially relevant to the question of whether the person has any phobias. The transcript describes the person's experience with a condition called cluster headaches, which are often referred to as ""suicide headaches"" due to the severe pain they cause. The person does not have a phobia of cluster headaches, but they are scared of the beast, which is a metaphor for the condition. The video is not entirely relevant to the question, as it does not focus on the person's phobias or fears, but rather on their personal life and experiences."," 1

Explanation: The video is a personal account of the author's experience with a condition called ""the beast,"" which is likely a cluster headache. The author does not mention any sources of information used to compile the publication, other than their own personal experience. Therefore, the video is not clear about the sources of information used, and the score is 1."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript is a personal account of the speaker's life, experiences, and struggles with a condition called cluster headaches or suicide headaches. The speaker provides details about his job, family, hobbies, and the symptoms and impact of his condition. The information is presented in a chronological and coherent manner, making it easy to follow and understand. However, the transcript does not provide any context about the video itself, such as the title, purpose, or date of production. This makes it difficult to fully assess the clarity of the video as a whole. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 2

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because it only presents one person's perspective on their experience with the beast, which is presumably a condition or disorder that causes severe pain. The video does not provide any information about the beast, its causes, or its treatments, nor does it acknowledge that other people might have different experiences or opinions. The video is focused on the individual's personal story and does not attempt to educate or inform the audience in a balanced way."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any details of additional sources of support and information. It is mainly focused on the narrator's personal experiences and feelings about their condition, without mentioning any resources or organizations that could help others in similar situations."," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty because the speaker is describing his experience with a condition called ""the beast,"" which is not explicitly named or defined. The symptoms he describes, such as the headache, eye pain, and curling up in a fetal position, are also not clearly explained or linked to a specific medical condition. The uncertainty lies in the fact that the viewer cannot be sure what the speaker is referring to or what causes his symptoms."," 1

Explanation: The video does not describe how any treatment works. It only talks about the person's life, experiences, and the symptoms of their condition. There is no mention of any treatment or how it works."," 1

FnIxSrFeB7M,"Hi, I want to talk to you about cluster headaches and how to get them cured. There's no strings attached. I just really want to help. I had them for seven years. I had them on both sides of my face. I used to rage anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour and a half to two hours. Sometimes maybe four or five hours the whole night. What I used to do is I used to have got to bed when I went to bed. Before I went to bed I went to sleep. I got everything ready. It was a hot water bottle. I used to get a hot water bottle and a bean bag in the microwave. I had a bucket of ice as well. Next to my bed I had my oxygen and a carrier case. I need to take it around. What I used to do with this I had this kind of attachment and I actually used to use the cold air that was coming out of here to cool the inside of my gums. What causes a cluster headache is many many theories and all that kind of stuff has been suggested. There's one doctor Dr. Elliot Schevel who at the headache clinic did a ligation in an artery that runs my upper jaw. Basically what happens is the blood vessel dilates, squeezes the nerve against the trigeminal nerve against the bone and wears the mileage heath away and short circuits the nerve telling the brain that your face has been ripped off. So you've got chronic nose, eye, teeth ache, your ear aches and you want to rub and cry and pace and scream and sway and yeah it was pretty bad. My lifestyle never went out. I knew at night I used to get them. I never used to drink. I couldn't enjoy other people's food. Just to fear there was things that would trigger it off that were in the food and I sort of narrowed it down to basically any drink that's carbonated used to narrow it down. I had to stop smoking because just the smoking would induce it. MSG, monosodium glutamate, modified starch, too much sugar, preservatives, fruit juices, dried fruits, anything like that would trigger this headache. Even a fisherman's that fisherman mint used to do. I used to sleep upright so I never I didn't lie flat and basically it's a very nasty headache to live with and I suggested if anything I'm saying to you sounds familiar I suggest you get hold of the headache clinic find out what they do and how they do it. You can contact them, you can phone them, you can also contact get onto the website the website is www.theheadacheclinic.co.za and you can also find Dr. Chaville's work and procedures that have been put onto Wikipedia. He's been doing this since 1995. He's got a state of life facility and I suggest you go and take your life back and that's really what I did. I have my life back so I also want to take this opportunity if Dr. Chaville if you are listening I want to just thank you and your team of nurses your specialized nurses and your state of life facilities for giving me back my life. I didn't know I could have been it was so easy and so quick to get cured and I'm completely completely headache free. I can drink beer, I can have starch, I can eat a slab of chocolate. It's just wonderful getting your life back and watching also how happy people are that this has affected because really this does affect the loved ones around you they don't know what to do how to look after you how they can help you and it's a very stressful time for them as well. So for you for your loved ones I suggest you get hold of Dr. Chaville at the headache clinic and let him take care of you because he's a pioneer in this industry and he knows exactly what's going on and you won't be the first if you're coming from the end of the earth you won't be the first and you won't be the last.

XWAq1AUFUqA,"Hello, my name is Jeff Parker and I am a 42 year cluster headache survivor. It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love.",4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,3,4,3,2,4,4,4," 4

Y1K0mQgKceQ,"I want to share with you an experience I had recently with bad medications and good medications concerning cluster headaches. I started getting headaches on August the 4th. I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",3,2,4,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2,4,4,2," 3

An8lK5VqNxU,"Hello, my name is Max Edmond and I'm going to share with you today what I do to combat cluster headaches. First of all, Red Bull, I usually drink about a half of one. I take Kudzu root powder as a supplement during the day to help reduce the headaches. When I'm having an attack, I drink half of Red Bull. Any diphenhydramine allergy medicine, this is a Waldro brand. And I also take one BC powder or Goody powder because it has caffeine and it gets to the headache really quick. For the eyes, clear eyes or any Visine will help. Also what's helpful when it's allergy season is a neti pot to clear out the right side. What I normally do is I heat up some rice and I put it into a rice pack and you can tell when it's hot. And then I'll put it in a sock of any sort and I use a funnel to put it in. And then once the rice pack is full, I will rest on a couch or another hard surface and apply the heat to the side of my head that hurts the most. And it's always the right side and I think for most cluster headache sufferers, it is the right side. So this is my advice to you to do this whenever you're having an attack. I usually have one probably about an hour after I take a nap or an hour after I try to go to sleep. And most nights I do sleep on the couch when I'm going through my cycles because on the armrest I can turn my head in this fashion. For some reason it relaxes the side of my neck for the carotid artery where most of the pain comes from and generates from. But most of the pain goes up here to this part of my head. So I have to move my head and apply the pressure in different areas with the rice pack to be able to slow it down. And normally I can get it under control within 15 or 30 minutes. And also if you do not want heat, you can massage the areas and apply pressure to where it hurts the most. But again, one half of any type of Red Bull because of the taurine, one diphenhydramine, usually a 25 milligram, and one BC or goody powder in combination. If you're allergic to any of these, please do not do this. And as a supplement, it cuts the root powder and it will help you get through your cycles faster. Thank you for your time.

uGqN1whhPf4,I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel that familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex or start oxygen treatments. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pang is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take chances and wait to take medicine too late when you feel the familiar pain starting. You must take the medicine right away. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in excruciating pain. Here are the different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumatriptan. Taking the medicine orally. Slowest way to relieve from the pain. A one shot dose in nasal spray form. Two to three times quicker than oral ingestion for relieving pain. Needle injections are very fast for obtaining pain relief.,4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,3,2,4,4,2," 4

So in the next minute or so I'll briefly summarize some basics I've learned by reading articles on reputable and reliable resources like these. There are dozens of reasons for severe headaches. I couldn't possibly list them all in one video. So I'll focus here just on the most common. Medical professionals categorize headaches two ways, primary and secondary. Primary headaches include so-called cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches. You get primary headaches from issues that are not related to illnesses or diseases. Such headaches are triggered by drinking too much alcohol, particularly red wine. Certain foods, especially processed meats containing nitrates. Changes in sleep patterns or lack of sleep. Bad posture. Skipped meals. Stress. Secondary headaches, on the other hand, usually result from some underlying physical disorder. The degree of pain varies greatly with these types. The list of triggers for secondary headaches goes on and on and on. Some are temporary and mild, like dental problems or an ear infection. Some are severe and chronic, ranging from multiple concussions to brain tumors. Naturally, your doctor is your best source of information about the reasons for your severe headaches. Certain prescription or over-the-counter medications often help. I've produced several other videos on related topics. You can find links to those videos below.",4,3,4,3,3,4,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

ckV6qk27fng,"Cluster Headaches are not migraines. People with cluster headaches experience three to four headaches a day, and these clusters last in periods of two weeks to three months. The headaches can occur like clockwork arriving at almost the same time every day. Men get cluster headaches more than women, and the cause of them is unknown. A cluster headache is always centrally located around the eye. Here are some descriptions of what a cluster headache feels like from people who have experienced them. It's like a burning, hot poker being shoved through your eye while an elephant stands on your temple while someone is punching you in the back of the head and pulling on your hair. Waking out of a sound sleep like somebody hit you in the back of the head with a baseball bat, like my left eyeball is going to explode, crying, moaning, rocking back and forth, praying that it will stop. It feels like my eyeball is in a vise and I have noticed some tautness in the base of my right neck muscles. It's an acute, stabbing pain like a knife behind your eye. It feels like a stabbing pain. I have pain in the jaw, cheek, and neck. The pain is so bad that even touching my hair on my left side hurts. My left sinus cavity is always blocked and I feel I am stuffed up. I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. Here's the basic nature of my headaches. First I feel a slight burning sensation in my left nostril. There is no other feeling like the burn and it can only be associated with a cluster headache. If you think you are having cluster headaches you must familiarize yourself with what the burn in the nostril feels like in order to be able to take medicine right away. Within a couple of minutes of feeling the burn, a 1-2 second pulsating stab of pain will occur over or behind my left eye. The pulsating pain and the burn start increasing in intensity very quickly. In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose.

U7NA0p8edn0,"Well, it was about four years ago. We were all in a movie theater. I think we were watching Harry Potter. And I started getting a lot of pain and didn't feel very well. So I left toward the end of the movie and went out to the car. When I got to the car, I had what I would call the worst headache of my life. I thought I was having an aneurysm and it just felt like my head was gonna explode. So they came out from the movie and we went right to the emergency room. And from there, they suggested I see a neurologist. So I reached out to the Jefferson Headache Center and signed up to enter their program. And that was a real turning point for me. I got a good diagnosis there almost immediately. And then I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. Because at that point, I really had no idea. And I was scared. The pain was intense. And it was very difficult to work, very difficult to attend social functions, etc., to do anything really, with the fear of having an attack in the middle of it. So many people with chronic cluster headaches and some with episodic cluster headaches go through a process of having difficulty at work, not having attendance issues, having performance issues because they're struggling through this thing that nobody really understands. And they sort of go through this spiral of losing a job and then taking another job, losing that job, then losing their health insurance. And then they end up with very little. Why do they call these the suicide headaches? Well, because it takes everything away from you. I think it's not so much the pain, although the pain is horrendous. Living in pain is very difficult. Any chronic pain sufferer can tell you that. But the inability to concentrate, to maintain an activity for an extended period of time beyond, say, 20 minutes, those are things that really steal from you your ability to do things day to day. If I'm completely honest, I've thought about it. You've thought about ending it. Yeah, yeah, I have, on a number of occasions. But then I think about my daughters and my wife and what they bring to me and to some degree what I do for them. And that just changes my thinking. There is definitely a way to live and it can be positive. And I think there's always room to have that downtime and that pity party, but at a certain point, that's not fun anymore. And you have to really think about what you can do and that your life's not the same anymore. It's different. And so how do you reform what you're going to do with your life in this new state? And that's kind of what I have done in putting my energy into a support group and that sort of thing, keeping up with the house as much as I'm able to.

Iw7FvRjeDX0,"Is there anyone in the world who has never had a headache? In some cases, you can solve this pesky problem by yourselves. Yet sometimes, you should see a doctor immediately. Therefore, we've put together a detailed guide to help you identify five types of headaches and the best ways to get rid of them. Tension headache. This is the most frequent type of headache in the world. Everyone has experienced it at least once in their life. Here are the main symptoms. Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one. Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

OO5oDaG45kE,"The following report contains some disturbing images. It is one of the most painful experiences that a human can endure. It feels as though somebody is grabbing your inside of your face and pulling as far out and as far wide as they can. Difficult to watch, often unbearable to experience. The pain of a cluster headache can be indescribable. Some sufferers post videos showing an attack to try and convey the reality. We're using these with their permission. Scott has suffered them for 10 years. He helps run a support group, Ouch! UK. I have knocked myself out on various occasions. Because of the pain, I will find something very, very hard to strike my head against. Because you're driven, it's a primeval driver to stop the pain. Cluster headaches baffle doctors. Far more intense than a migraine, many sufferers, like Rachel, experience them when seasons change. I will get mine every spring and every autumn without fail. Rachel's volunteered for a new research project taking place at King's College Hospital in south London. We're looking to see what happens in the brain during the attacks compared to when there is no attack. Around 40 sufferers will have their brains scanned. This is the posterior hypothalamus and it's also known as the internal body clock. We think that is linked with the cluster headache attacks. They tend to have more cluster attacks around spring and autumn. We don't quite understand the reason behind that. This will be an ambitious, at times arduous project. Volunteers will also be having their brains scanned whilst an attack is taking place. Unless people put themselves forward to things like this, we're never going to know any more about cluster headaches. It's estimated there are around 130,000 sufferers in the UK, possibly more as the condition is often misdiagnosed. This patient, who's asked to remain anonymous, is being injected with steroids and an anaesthetic, a preventative measure that can help but is only effective for a few weeks. We're supposed to damp down the activity of the nerves, hence give some relief to these patients. It's hoped this device, which would be implanted inside a patient's head, could offer long-term help. The way it does is by delivering some electricity around the nerve and damping down the hyperactivity, the excessive activation of the nerves, which is firing without any control. Trials are going well. The team at Guy's in St Thomas' Hospital hope to make it available within a year, a long-awaited step forward for sufferers of this distressing condition.

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video seems to be about a technique to relieve or reduce the pain of a cluster headache. However, the instructions are not very clear, and it is difficult to understand what exactly the viewer should be feeling or doing at each step. The video also includes unrelated information, such as breathing exercises and using a cold wet towel on the eyes. The video could be improved by providing more detailed and coherent instructions, and by removing unnecessary information."," 2

Explanation: The video aims to provide a method for relieving cluster headache pain using a series of hand placements and breathing exercises. While the video does demonstrate a series of hand placements and breathing exercises, it lacks any clear explanation of the underlying mechanisms or scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of the method.

Additionally, the transcript contains some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the numbering system, which may cause confusion for some viewers. Therefore, the video is not entirely clear, but it does offer some useful information that could be helpful for people suffering from cluster headaches."," 1

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because it is promoting a specific method for treating cluster headaches without providing any scientific evidence or references to support its claims. The video also includes the presenter asking for a thumbs up and for viewers to turn on notifications, which indicates a potential bias towards gaining popularity or increasing viewership rather than providing an objective and informative presentation."," 2

9F_FpZB5LWU,"My name is Jenny McLaren and this is my cluster headache awareness project. Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. We can fight the fear of impending attacks together through advocacy and support. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me?",4,4,5,4,4,2,4,5,2,2,2,4,4,4,2," 4

bSeYYXlH1MQ,"""Hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches?"" Your nose will start running, hurting,and sneezing. Capsaicin is the burning component of hot peppers. Why would you do such an experiment? Anyone who's handled the compound in the lab knows that if it gets up your nose it causes an intense burning sensation, however this phenomenon has not been formally investigated. Therefore it appeared worthwhile to study the effects produced by the topical application of capsaicin in the human nose. It therefore appeared worthwhile because it had never been done before? OK... So they took some medical students dripped some in their nose and they started sneezing, burning, and snotting. Describing the pain as like 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. No surprise, but here's the interesting part. What do you think happened when they repeated the experiment the next day? You'd think they might be sensitized to it, still all irritated and so it might hurt even worse, but no, it hurt less. Then they did it again the next day and the next. By day 5 it hardly hurt at all, they didn't even get a runny nose, no sneezing. Came back the next week, day ten and still nothing. Sheesh, were they like permanently numbed? No, after a month or so the desensitization wore off and they were back in agony whenever they tried rubbing it in their nose. What the researchers think is happening is that the pain fibers, the nerves that carry pain sensation, dumped so much of the pain neurotransmitter called substance P that they ran out. Day after day of this the nerves had exhausted their stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they made more substance P from scratch, which takes a couple of weeks. This gave researchers an idea. There's a rare headache syndrome called cluster headache. It has been described as one of the worst pains humans experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It's nicknamed the ""suicide headache"" because patients often consider taking or have taken their lives over it. It's thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to botox to surgery. But hey, that same nerve goes down to the nose. What if we cause the whole nerve to dump all its substance P? ""Preventative effect of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache"". Same as before, capsaicin in the nose and by day 5 they could hardly feel it any more. Note though that these were cluster headache sufferers and so what was rated as an 8 or 9 on the pain scale by the whimpy medical students was like, maybe a 3 or 4 by those used to the violence of the cluster headache attacks. Having achieved desensitization, what happened to their headaches? Well cluster headaches are one-sided headaches, you only get pain on one side of your head. So those who had rubbed capsaicin in the opposite nostril, on the wrong side of the head, nothing happened. They started out having like 40 attacks a day and a month later the headaches were still going strong, but those that rubbed the capsaisin in the nostril on the side of the head where the headaches were, cut the average number of attacks in half. And in fact half the patients were cured! The cluster headaches were gone completely. All in all 80% responded, at least equal if not better than all the current therapies out there.",4,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

WAF_YT6PaCI,"Health Watch. Cluster headaches usually come on quickly and then come back again and again for days. And sufferers say the pain is so intense it's almost unbearable. Health Watch reporter Beth Galvin is here now with more. Beth. And Wes and Lisa, these kind of headaches get their name because they tend to strike in clusters. And during these cycles called cluster periods, the headaches can hit every day, sometimes several times a day. There is no cure, but there are some treatments that can help offer some relief. It really feels like someone stabbing a hot poker through your eye. I tell people like an elephant standing on your temple as well. For 31-year-old Justin Ott, describing what it's like to suffer from cluster headaches is enough to make him cringe. I will get them every single day, multiple times a day, if I don't take medication. Unfortunately, I take medication that sets them back a bit so I only get groups of clusters throughout the year. These attacks happen in a cluster and may last from weeks to months. Patterns of clusters vary from person to person, but most people have at least one or two cluster periods a year. Hi Justin, how are you? Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you. Cluster headaches are the most debilitating of the disorders. It's also dubbed suicide headache because of its severity. The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown and there is not currently a cure. Doctors like Susan Broner of the Headache Institute at Roosevelt Hospital prescribe medications to help decrease the severity of the pain and shorten the headache cycle. Unfortunately, the medications don't stop it 100%, but they help me live my life. Fortunately for Justin and other cluster headache patients, oxygen therapy is an alternative that is successful and has no side effects. In a recently published study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that this treatment is actually more favorable than once thought. Results were that 78% of people with cluster headache responded to high flow oxygen. They were headache free within 15 minutes of using the oxygen. And that was compared to their placebo which was air, high flow air, in which only 20% of people responded. So there was a marked difference between the placebo and the treatment of high flow oxygen. Dr. Broner hopes to see more studies done to show just how this therapy works, but in the meantime, she's happy to see some of her patients pain free. I found oxygen to be the best abortive for me. When I'm home, I can take the oxygen, watch TV, just sitting there, and it's safe. And there's no side effects. And in rare cases, surgery is recommended for cluster headache sufferers who just do not respond to treatments like oxygen therapy or medication. If you're having headaches that disrupt your daily life, you may want to see your doctor so that the two of you, Russ and Lisa, can kind of get to the bottom of what's causing these headaches, what they are, and how best to treat your headaches. Yeah, it can give you your life back. Yes, because these people really do suffer a lot. Beth Galvin, thanks. Thanks, Beth. There are still several cold...

9mQSO4Tzbwk,"The choice is very simple for me. Suicide or psychedelics. Dan suffers from one of the most painful afflictions known to humankind, cluster headaches. The headaches afflict around one in a thousand people and men are more prone than women. These can't be compared with a headache or a head attack. The cause of the condition remains unknown. Oxygen can sometimes abort the attacks, but if that fails, sufferers face a bout of excruciating pain that can last for up to three hours. It feels like a hot dagger is being poked through one's eye all the way through one's brain. It's just devastating to see someone in that much pain and there's nothing that I can do for him. There was one occasion that I was laying in bed knowing that I was going to end it. And I was trying to picture the last time I saw my kids. And that was a bad day. I was trying to figure out what I was going to wear when I put a bullet in my head. That was a bad day. With Dan on the verge of suicide and the family in crisis, Leanne made a life-saving discovery. I read on one of the cluster headache sites about people using mushrooms. And at first I thought it was really kind of strange, but at that point nothing else seemed to be working, so I thought it was worth giving it a try. It was the best medicine we ever found. This natural fungi contains powerful psychoactive compounds and has been inducing mind-bending psychedelic trips in users for thousands of years. Unwilling to buy from illicit drug dealers, Dan grows his own magic mushrooms. Here's the medicine chest where the magic happens. Dan has to grow his magic mushrooms in the right environment. I've got to keep the humidity at 99%. Keep the temperature at 75 degrees and fall off. There are mushrooms. Once I pick the mushrooms, I bring them in here, put them under a ceiling fan, let them air dry for 24 hours. Once they're cracker dried, they're good for storage for a year or two. Best two years of pain-free living right there. It's homegrown. Some people have the stomach to just take them like that. But capsules, it's better on the stomach and a lot easier on nausea and easier to get down. He had lost his passion for all of the things that he used to love.

While the video does provide some information about cluster headaches and the person's experience, it lacks a broader perspective on the topic."," 2

The video provides some details about the use of psilocybin mushrooms as a potential treatment for cluster headaches, but it does not offer any additional sources of support or information for people who may be suffering from similar conditions. The video focuses mainly on the personal experience of one individual and does not provide any context about the scientific evidence behind the use of psilocybin mushrooms for this purpose, nor does it mention any other alternative treatments or support groups that might be available to people with cluster headaches."," 4

The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the cause of cluster headaches remains unknown, which is mentioned in the transcript. Second, the effectiveness of oxygen as a treatment is uncertain, as it can sometimes abort the attacks but not always. Third, the use of psilocybin mushrooms as a treatment for cluster headaches is not widely accepted or proven, and Dan has to grow his own mushrooms without guidance from a medical professional. Finally, the long-term effects of using psilocybin mushrooms for medical purposes are unclear. Therefore, the video partially refers to areas of uncertainty, and the score is 4."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how each treatment works. It explains that Dan uses magic mushrooms to treat his cluster headaches, and it provides some details about how he grows and consumes them. However, it does not explain the exact mechanism by which the mushrooms alleviate the pain or how they compare to other treatments for cluster headaches."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains how psychedelic mushrooms help Dan with his cluster headaches, but it does not provide a comparison with other treatments or a detailed explanation of how the mushrooms work. The video also focuses more on Dan's story and the severity of his condition rather than the benefits of the treatment itself."," 3

Explanation: The video does not provide a comprehensive description of the risks of each treatment. It only briefly mentions the risks of not taking the mushrooms, which is the potential return of unbearable cluster headaches. The risks of suicide are mentioned, but they are not directly related to the treatments. The video mainly focuses on the positive effects of the mushrooms on Dan's condition."," 4

The video does partially describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It shows that Dan was considering suicide due to the unbearable pain caused by cluster headaches, and it mentions that he would experience the pain again if he stops taking the mushrooms every two months. However, the video does not explicitly state the consequences of not using any treatment, such as long-term health issues or disability."," 4

The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video shows how Dan's life improved after using psychedelic mushrooms to treat his cluster headaches, allowing him to experience pain-free living for two years. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the quality of life before and after the treatment, nor does it discuss potential side effects or long-term consequences of using psychedelic mushrooms as a treatment option."," 4

The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mainly focuses on the use of psychedelic mushrooms as a treatment for cluster headaches, but it does mention oxygen as another possible treatment. However, the video does not provide much information on other potential treatment options or compare the effectiveness of the mentioned treatments."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as it shows how Dan and his family decided to use psilocybin mushrooms as a treatment for his cluster headaches after researching and finding no other effective options. However, the video does not explicitly discuss the potential risks and benefits of this treatment, nor does it involve a medical professional in the decision-making process. The score of 4 reflects that the video partially supports shared decision-making, but more information and expert involvement would be needed for a higher score.",set(),189
ZPOYysJ04N8,"Hey, what's up everybody? My name is Tyler Mann. I am a director of photography and documentary filmmaker out of Austin, Texas. I'm 35 years old. You've probably seen my work. Places like here, here, here, here, and tons and tons and tons of other places. So if you have cable, you've probably seen my work. I am a fellow sufferer of cluster headaches. I'm lucky. I'm only a seasonal sufferer, so I'll only get my headaches three months out of the year. I'm just ending my cycle as we speak now. I started getting them around 2006. I wasn't quite sure what they were. I thought they were allergies, but I have pretty bad sinuses, so I thought it was all related to sinuses and allergies and stuff like that. Fast forward maybe four or five years, I finally figured out what it was and started to get treatment. Some of it's worked to some degree, most of it hasn't, like many of you know. So I decided that last year that I was going to document people like me to raise awareness. We all know that there's not much going on in the medical community when it comes to people like us. Not a whole lot of research, treatments that don't work. So basically that leads to this. What is the project? It's a documentary. It's a feature length film. So the goals of the film. This is a story about us. It's about you. It's about cluster sufferers. This is to tell our story. We want to basically make as intimate a story as we can. Our goal is to basically spend time with about four to five different families, document their day to day lives, how it's affected them, how it's affected their work, their personal lives, their love lives, their relationships with other people, their friendships, everything. We want to document it all. We also want to document the legislative process. Everything that's going on with advocacy groups, going to the headache on the hill, all that type of stuff. We want to go to these things. We want to talk to lawmakers. We want to talk to doctors. We want to cover basically every angle that we can on this. That's our goal. An all-encompassing documentary but told through personal stories. Okay, so our immediate fundraising goals. The reason why we're making this video is because we need initial seed money. It takes capital to shoot a documentary, even a five-minute documentary. It still takes capital. So this video is to send out to you guys, potential investors, sufferers. We need a little head start. We need something to get us going. Our plan is to take the money, this initial seed money, go out, shoot a couple families, throw that into a proof of concept mini-documentary that we can show other potential investors on down the road to get our full feature-length budget. So, after our initial seed investment, we're going to start a Kickstarter campaign. We're going to be open to the public, open to everybody to pitch in, be a part of this. We want everybody to feel included. We want everybody to have a voice and feel like they're a part of this project. So yeah, if you want to be a part of this, if you want to get involved early on, there is a PayPal donation link here. And there will be one in the description of the video here. And yeah, feel free, give whatever you can, you know, whatever amount helps, even a dollar, whatever you can do. So let's get out there, work together, and let's get our stories told.",4,3,4,2,4,3,3,4,1,2,1,2,2,2,2," 4

ghTw40gDSR4,"You are here for one of these reasons. One, somebody sent you. Two, you love my face. Three, where are you? What is this? How do I get out of here? What's up, kleptos? Today I'm going to talk about the very rare and serious illness that I have. Cluster headaches. And before you say, I suffer from headaches and or migraines. Typical answer here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's not that type of headache. Yes, every now and again we get those pesky little buggers because the neighbor's kid Joshua is joshing around in your rose bush. And now his parents are yelling at you because apparently you forgot to cut it, but fuck that kid. Yes, we also receive all those headaches that make us want to take a bunch of Advil and sleep all day, but it's not that type of headache. Well, maybe the last part. Let me begin with a very brief and scary explanation. A cluster headache is a headache that appears in clusters. It's also relative to time. So let's say I wake up at 5 a.m. each day with a cluster headache. I will wake up at 5 a.m. for the range of attacks. The cluster headache is also very constant in its clusters. I get a headache at 5 p.m. and it'll last for maybe 15 minutes, or it could last for two hours. And I get a short break of maybe 15 minutes to an hour, maybe two, it depends on the person. And it ends abruptly, so you never know when it's going to take a break. I mean, mine could last from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m., but it depends on how many drugs I'm taking. These attacks last not just one or two days, they could last for weeks, and in some extreme cases, more than five months. They're described as one of the worst pain a human being can endure, even worse than childbirth. And I ain't never had a kid, but... That's fucked up. It was today. Another name for cluster headache, suicide headache, because literally people want to die rather than endure it. And, not to mention, there is no treatment, the continuous cycle of clinic visits, pure oxygen doses, something called a nasal spray. So what effect does this have on people? First, of course, they get super irritated and annoyed and angry. It says angry, I said annoyed. But they also get annoyed, so that's something. Pain usually resides in one corner of the face, usually around the temples slash eye area. The eye becomes swollen and often droops. Nose passageways also become swollen, which makes a patient have a runny nose and redness. Hot compresses might help, showers do wonders. They are only temporary. And the headache medicine doesn't work unless you take enough to pass out, and I'm pretty sure that might kill you. You also can't sleep. Normally, people find that cluster headaches, while laying down, cause them to be worse. You know, if you lay on the side that hurts, it hurts. If you lay on the side that doesn't hurt, it hurts. Oh, how is the pain described? And please, if you're easily disturbed, you can skip ahead. This is how I describe the pain. Imagine someone holding pliers. That person thus sticks the plier right on your nerve, and they pull the nerve really, really tightly. Then, they twist the nerve back and forth. The pain is constant, never numbing. As they are doing this, they are also jagging it up and down with a knife, punching you in the face. What are some triggers for this illness? Alcohol, fruity smell, perfumes, light, the fucking sun. Loud noises sometimes, headaches, who would've guessed? Lack of sleep, and smoke. And also, it's not just cigarettes, and you don't need to be smoking them. And if you ever think that, yes, weed helps migraines, it's totally gonna help you, don't do it. You're being an asshole. Don't smoke anything in front of someone who has a cluster headache illness. How do I? Someone who does not know about cluster headaches, insert. Help. Well, for one thing, people experiencing attacks want to be left alone. They may pace around and cry sometimes, but don't touch them. They're not interested in how nice you can rub their back. Tell them it's okay. It might just wanna make them hit you in the face. And please understand, if they do yell, it's not their fault. This is not an invitation that you can yell back. Second point, keep them in a fairly quiet place. Third, darkness is good. Four, put a cloth in hot water and squeeze it out a little bit. Give it to them so they can press it to the area that is experiencing the pain. The heat will thus numb the pain a little bit. But remember not to burn yourself, because you're using hot water, not lukewarm. Watch them in case they burn themselves, because they might not realize how hard they're pressing. Five, don't have triggers around, you sick smoker. Alcoholic bitch. Six, and this is the most important point that a lot of people overlook. Do not have any dangerous objects around them. i.e. sharp objects, hard things like tools, medicines that could be dangerous towards them. No matter how much you know this person and how happy they seem in life, they might do something drastic. This is the same for hitting themselves. If you're experiencing a patient that is hitting themselves, try to replace their hand with a softer object. Like a pillow or maybe a stuffed animal. This way they can get their anger out, distract themselves, and they don't get hurt. So that was a little bit of information about the disease that I have. I think it's a disease. If you currently suffer from it, now you know certain triggers that maybe you didn't know. Maybe some remedies that could help you, like the wet cloth thing. If you have a mother or father or maybe a brother, sister, friend who suffers from this and you didn't know what it was and you just regarded it like, oh, it's just a headache. Well, it's not just a headache. It's very serious. And now you know how to take care of them, so that's cool too. And if you were just curious what is demands one talking about, weird illness, serious illness, oh, this sounds important. Um, it is. Oh, good on you for clicking it. Anyway, this is the end. Tell me, have you ever heard of cluster headaches? Did you know what it was prior to this? Do you know anybody who has a cluster headache? Let's start a conversation. See you later, kleptos. Pfft! That's the end of the video. Why not join the gang? Because together we can be insane. Stop that. What if I just threw up? And I ain't never had a kid, but for some odd reason it makes me become a Westerner. Go out in the hallway and say it. No, it's I suffer. No, do it. What's- Oh, I suffer from- I. You know what, I'm not even gonna use it. No, no, no. Before you say- Oh, I- Really? I suffer- Fuuuck! Suffer. The word is suffer. Why do- I need you. I need you too. I need you so much. No. So many kisses. Can he get these a dog? He's so cute.",3,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,2,2,2,1," 3

W7woJa444kA,"Cluster headaches are one of the most severe and painful types of headaches. They are characterized by intense stabbing pain around one eye, accompanied by tearing, a runny nose, and drooping of the eyelid. When the hypothalamus in the brain becomes dysfunctional, signals are sent into a bundle of nerves called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. The SPG acts like a fuse box, connecting the brain to nerve endings in the face. When these signals reach the vessels, they cause dilation and activate pain receptors. Pain signals are returned to the sensory area of the brain, where they are perceived as intense pain. The resulting cascade causes excruciating, one-sided pain around the eye that can radiate to the forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on the affected side. Because of the SPG's unique location in the pain loop, it has long been a treatment target. Today, there's a new option for cluster headache patients. Introducing the Pulsante SPG Microstimulator. It's designed to stimulate the SPG, interrupting the signals that cause pain during a cluster headache. A miniature microstimulator is about the size of a penny. Most patients cannot even feel it or see it. During a minimally invasive oral procedure, the microstimulator is inserted along the pathway above the second molar that allows the microstimulator to reach the SPG. The procedure lasts about an hour under general anesthesia and leaves no visible scars. Side effects are similar to other oral procedures and most resolve within 60 days. During a cluster attack, patients place the remote to their cheek to begin stimulation. The remote controller communicates with the Pulsante microstimulator to provide immediate therapy by directing mild electrical pulses to the SPG to interfere with signals, interrupting the cluster headache pain loop, effectively flipping the switch on the fuse box, turning off the headache. Pulsante therapy is a non-drug treatment option proven to rapidly relieve the pain of cluster headaches. There is no cure for cluster headaches, but Pulsante therapy can stop the pain, allowing you to return to the things you once enjoyed and reset the clock on cluster headache. Thank you.",5,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,2," 5

hx-HKPJwG8s,"Hey guys, Caitlin here and for this week's YouTube video I wanted to talk about cluster headaches. So cluster headaches are one of the three common types of headaches. So there's cluster headaches, migraines, and then there's tension headaches. With migraines, you're going to have that unilateral throbbing headache with associated nausea and vomiting. Sometimes there might be an aura preceding this headache. Other times you will have associated photophobia, hyperacusis. The headache's really going to be aggravated by movement. And then tension headaches are going to be a lot opposite of this. It's going to be more of a global headache squeezing in nature. They might have tight trapezius muscles associated with a lot of stress, not aggravated by movement, usually no nausea or vomiting, and usually no photophobia or hyperacusis. Now when it comes to cluster headaches, make sure you follow the DSM-5 diagnosis for these. It's usually going to include headaches that come in clusters, so headaches that can last for 15 or up to 180 minutes at a time. Usually cluster headaches are really unilateral, kind of like migraines, but they're usually centered around the eye, a little above the eye, or in the temporal area. And then a lot of times cluster headaches, you need at least one of the following physical exam findings. You need to have injected conjunctiva. You need to have lacrimation from the eye, maybe a little bit of eyelid edema, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. Usually in the forehead, there's a lot of sweating in that area or just anhydrous actually. We'll talk about Horner syndrome in a little bit. Sometimes with cluster headaches, you can have Horner syndrome, which is meiosis, so the pupil is going to be smaller in the affected eye. And then ptosis, which is just the eyelid drooping a little bit, or anhydrosis, so a lack of sweating on that side, so I don't have a lot of sweating on the other side. These patients may be very agitated and restless in the room as well. Just make sure you follow the DSM criteria for diagnosis. If you're in the emergency department and trying to make this first diagnosis, usually you have to rule out other big and bad things, and then the neurologist makes the diagnosis. But following those criteria can really help you identify a cluster headache versus something else. As I mentioned before, cluster headaches can be associated with something called Horner syndrome. This syndrome is a combination of ptosis, so eyelid drooping, meiosis, the pupil in the infected eye is constricted, and anhydrosis, so there is a lack of sweating on the affected eye. If the headache's on this side, you're going to see all these physical exam findings on that side. Now, just remember that if you see Horner syndrome, this isn't always associated with a cluster headache. You can have lung cancer that causes this, or something like a carotid artery dissection. Just keep in mind that this syndrome isn't always associated with something as benign as a cluster headache. A lot of these patients are going to be middle-aged men, and the triggers that often precede their cluster headaches unfortunately may be alcohol, it may wake them up in the middle of the night, they may have gotten done with using nitroglycerin use, or any histamine release can trigger cluster headaches. Now with a patient presenting to you in the emergency department complaining of a headache, and it sure does sound like a cluster headache, before you go and treat them for a cluster headache, ask the patient have they ever been diagnosed with a cluster headache. If they have, then usually this is done by a neurologist and they've ruled out some of the other big bad causes of headaches. But if they haven't, definitely ask the patients, and in my mind, always ask any patient with a headache some of the red flags for the headache. And for this, I like to use the mnemonic SNOOP. So the S will stand for Systemic Signs and Symptoms. So are they having any fevers, are they having any neck stiffness concerning for meningitis, or are they having persistent night sweats and now their headache is worse in the morning and they have a little bit of weight loss that's unexplained concerning for cancer. Or do they have a previous diagnosis of cancer, now that they're having these headaches that's concerning for at least secondary cancer going to the brain. And then the N will stand for any neurologic symptoms. So this is obviously concerning for stroke or any mass lesions. O can stand for an onset greater than 50 years old. Obviously concerning for giant cell arthritis or any glaucoma. Since these headaches tend to go and present around the eye, definitely make sure that the eye doesn't feel hard, there's no acute angle glaucoma. You definitely don't want to diagnose them with a cluster headache when they had acute angle glaucoma. And then the next O can stand for an onset that happens suddenly. Obviously concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage that with a sudden onset, the worst headache of your life that we all read about in books. And then the P's can stand for papilledema, obviously concerning for intracranial hypertension. Any positional changes or the headache may be precipitated by Valsalva or any progressive headaches, any new or changing headaches are all red flags of a headache. And make sure you ask this with almost every single patient. So when you're asking some of those red flags for a headache, you obviously don't want to miss some of the more dangerous causes of a headache in that area that may sound like a cluster headache. Like I mentioned before, Horner syndrome can be seen in carotid artery dissections, so make sure the patient doesn't have any neck pain. You usually don't miss this. These patients are in extreme pain and they will have symptoms in this area. Obviously you don't want to miss giant cell arteritis, so they have an itinerary palpation in this area. And they have other signs or symptoms of giant cell arteritis like jaw codification, then definitely work them up in that regard. Other signs or other headaches are trigeminal neuralgia. You can have TMJ syndrome obviously going up into that area. So just kind of think about some of the mimics, acute sinusitis or a glaucoma. You don't want to miss these other headaches that can precipitate like cluster headaches, but obviously be a little more dangerous. So just keep in mind of the mimics of a cluster headache as well. And when it comes to the treatment of a cluster headache, usually this is very simple. High flow oxygen is the treatment of choice. So these patients need to have oxygen up to 10 liters at a time and do that until their headache gets better. And then you can also do some of the other headache treatments like sumatriptan. I've done that as well along with intranasal, Ytcane 4%. These are all very helpful in addition to help control the cluster headaches. And that's it guys. Thanks for listening.

PQdPbOsN97U,"52 year old Helga Christensen lives in Ormskirk near her son Daniel. I'm very gregarious on how going when I'm well. I've traveled all over the world, there's scuba diving, I've done lots and lots of things and it all stopped. Singing, dancing, everything stopped because the pain is too bad. For eight years Helga has suffered from crippling headaches that paralyzed the right hand side of her body. Doctors recognize the condition that there is no known cause. All they can do is treat the pain. A week ago her doctors tried a new treatment, a nerve block injection, but it seems to have made things worse. It's as though your skull is being crushed in a vise and it's gonna explode. You feel like your eyes, everything is just gonna explode out and it's like a tsunami of pain. You can't speak, you can't do anything, you're helpless. Helga has come back to the Walton Center desperate to find out what's going on. What I'm often aware of is that when we treat someone for one headache condition we will settle that down and another headache condition will leak out and I think what's happened here is we've switched it off and I think you've leaked out into a different type of headache and this headache disturbance looks more like cluster headache which is generally considered to be one of the most horrific pain conditions known. A treatment we use for cluster headache is nerve blocks. Now I know the last nerve block has turned off your hemikranial continua and this other headache condition has now come on in its place. I'm not going to threaten you with that at the moment but I think that's something to consider over the next week or two if we're really having difficulties and not controlling. So keep a diary, keep a very close idea on this and I'll write your prescription for the summa trip down. Cluster headache is notoriously difficult to treat. For now Dr. Silva gives her strong migraine drugs. If this is cluster headache he knows it will come back. It's a week since Helga Christensen last saw Dr. Silva and her headache has come back. Helga Christensen. Hi. Hi. Nice to see you. Come on in, have a seat. I can't move, I can't stand up, I can't sit down, I can't lie down, the light, everything. Have you been through normal childbirth before? Yes. Yeah, so in comparison was childbirth painful? It was but when I'm in full threat to this I would rather have that. Yeah. I know in the past we've done a nerve block and this has happened since a nerve block but one potential would be to try another nerve block procedure and I don't know if you want to do that. Oh. Do you want me to do a nerve block on you now? Yes please do something. I'll just go and get the kit for you. If you just wait a moment I'll go and get something. Helga has had this injection once before. It only offers short-term relief and there's a limit to how many times it can be used. The nerve block is a combination of steroids and local anesthetic that's injected directly into a nerve at the back of her head. So just remind me which side is the pain on? Right. Okay. Dr. Silva must control the immediate pain before he can work out a long-term solution. This isn't just about pain. I mean cluster headache is a hugely debilitating horrific condition. Generally once you have it you will usually have it through your life so there will be spells when you're affected and spells when you're well and for some people they may have it on a regular basis long term so it's a condition that's going to need managing for a long time. It's a week since Helga Christensen had a nerve block injection for a severe headache. She's now having agonizing attacks every day. I'm a bit frightened that it's spiraling a little bit do you know what I mean? I need to find some way of sort of capping it and I know you're trying your best to help me there. Yeah I think we need to get a preventative strategy that has something to work quickly and something that will work a bit more slowly over time that we can build up. For 90% of people a course of steroids will actually turn this off. Right. Very rarely people with steroids go a bit dulally on them and they start getting very depressed or agitated or you know even acting a bit strangely or even psychotic seeing things. If you had anything like that you stop it on that day but it's extremely rare especially in young people. The next thing that we do at the same time is start you on this drug for rapamil. Helga is entering a new phase of treatment. All the drugs they try now have risks attached. None of these drugs are licensed for cluster headache. We don't have drugs that have been studied and studied to the extent where they have a license in the UK. They're getting to the point where I literally would do anything if you if you said anything I would do it try it because I just have to get rid of this acute pain. Bye. The steroids worked for a few weeks but the headaches came back and with them a debilitating paralysis of her right-hand side. She's unable to walk or speak during the attacks and can't leave the house for days at a time. I'm forever the optimist about this and I will beat this. I know I'll beat it eventually and in the meantime I'll just carry on and on the good days I'll do what I'm good at like today and on the bad days curl up in a ball and hibernate and hopefully there'll be more good days than bad days.",4,3,5,2,4,2,4,5,3,2,3,2,4,4,2," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video is about a woman named Helga who suffers from a severe headache condition that has no known cause and has tried various treatments without success. The video follows her journey as she seeks help from doctors and tries different treatments to manage her pain. However, the video does not clearly state what the main goal or message is, other than showing the struggles of someone with a rare and debilitating condition."," 3

Explanation: The video does not achieve its aims completely. It shows the struggles of a patient with a rare and severe headache condition, and the efforts of a doctor to find a treatment. However, the video does not provide a clear resolution or success story. The patient's condition seems to be still ongoing, and the treatment options are risky and uncertain. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 5

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a real case of a woman suffering from a rare and debilitating headache condition, and it shows the challenges and treatments involved in managing such a condition. The video also provides insight into the experiences of the patient and the doctor, and it highlights the importance of finding the right treatment strategy for a complex and difficult-to-treat condition like cluster headache."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The video mentions that the doctor, Dr. Silva, is the main source of information, as he is the one treating Helga and discussing her condition. However, the video does not mention any other sources, such as medical journals, research studies, or expert opinions from other doctors. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The transcript is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced, but it is not clear if the information is accurate or up-to-date. The transcript is a summary of a YouTube video about a woman with a rare and severe headache condition, and it provides details about her symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the transcript does not indicate when the video was produced or if the information is still relevant or current. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 2

Explanation: The video is not balanced and unbiased because it focuses on the negative aspects of Helga's condition and the challenges of finding a treatment. It does not provide any information about the positive aspects of her life or any potential solutions that are not related to medication. The video also seems to promote a specific treatment (nerve block injection) without considering other alternatives."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as the doctor's advice to keep a diary of the headache attacks and to monitor the treatment's effectiveness. However, it does not offer a comprehensive list of resources or organizations that could help people suffering from similar conditions. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects. First, the doctors are unsure of the cause of Helga's condition, as they mention that there is no known cause for her headaches. Second, the treatment options are uncertain, as they try different treatments, such as nerve block injections, steroids, and rapamil, without knowing if they will be effective in the long term. Third, the prognosis is uncertain, as Helga's headaches come and go, and the doctors are not sure if they will be able to find a permanent solution. Therefore, the video scores a 5, indicating that it does refer to areas of uncertainty."," 3

Explanation: The video describes some treatments, such as nerve block injections and steroids, but it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of how each treatment works. It also does not discuss other potential treatments for cluster headaches. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear description of the benefits of each treatment. It mainly focuses on the patient's experience and the doctor's attempts to diagnose and treat her condition. The video does mention some potential benefits of the treatments, such as providing short-term relief or preventing long-term complications, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the different treatment options or their outcomes. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 3

Explanation: The video describes the risks of the nerve block treatment, which is a combination of steroids and local anesthetic that's injected directly into a nerve at the back of Helga's head. The risks include short-term relief, limited usage, and potential side effects such as depression, agitation, or psychosis from the steroids. However, the video does not describe the risks of other treatments for cluster headache, such as rapamil or other medications. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only shows the process of trying different treatments and their effects on the patient. The transcript focuses on the doctor's attempts to find the right medication and procedure for Helga's condition, but it does not provide any information about the natural course of the disease or the consequences of not treating it. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but not in a comprehensive manner. It shows the struggles of Helga Christensen with her headaches and how they affect her daily life, but it does not provide a detailed comparison of different treatment options and their impact on her quality of life. The video also does not discuss the long-term effects of the treatments or how they might influence her future lifestyle. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor discusses the possibility of trying another nerve block procedure, using steroids, and starting the patient on a drug called rapamil. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive list of all possible treatment options, so the score is not a perfect 5."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the patient's condition and the doctor's attempts to treat it, but it does not show a clear example of shared decision-making. The patient seems to be passive and deferential to the doctor's suggestions, and the doctor does not involve the patient in the decision-making process. The video could be improved by showing more dialogue between the patient and the doctor about the pros and cons of different treatment options, and by demonstrating how the patient is actively participating in the decision-making process.",set(),195

And today we're going to talk about, you know, a different type of a headache called cluster headaches. Believe it or not, cluster headaches are actually one of the most painful conditions a person can go through. It's almost like having a knife in your eye. And that is the key feature actually of a cluster headache. So if somebody has excruciating pain right in their eye, lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, possibly that could be a cluster headache. Apart from that, you would also have features like watering in your eye, runny nose, redness in your eye. And this headache is so bad that instead of lying down still, people who actually have it are really restless. So what can you do for it? Well, foremost, definitely speak to your doctor. Since there are techniques and medications that you can do that can definitely reduce the pain at that time. What you need to do is, of course, take the right medication in time that will help reduce the pain.

eqSTRJwQcys,"Trigger finger is a condition of the hand that limits finger movement. It is characterized by the inability to straighten a finger from a flexed position. It occurs due to tenosynovitis caused by inflammation of the tendon sheath surrounding the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The swelling and inflammation prevents the tendon from gliding smoothly through the sheath and thus the finger gets stuck in a bent position and then snaps back into place. Treatment for this condition involves releasing the swollen A1 pulley sheath surrounding the tendons. It is an open procedure in which a small incision is made along the palm to expose the A1 pulley, which is then cut. The finger is then tested to ensure that smooth flexion occurs.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,3,2,2,2,4,2," 4

iAIzUb4cl4M,"- Trigger finger is a type of tendonitis in the hand, one of the most common that we see. And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position. More commonly, people come because it's sore, and the soreness is what they're looking for treatment of, not so much the actual locking. A treatment for trigger finger, you can try conservative management with taking Motrin, Advil. Occasionally, we'll have people try splinting the finger straight. People report that in the morning, they'll often wake up with their finger bent. And so, we find if they sleep with the finger straight at night, the tendon is not as likely to get caught. But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

YwpB1fi50I4,"- [Narrator] Your forearms contain flexor muscles that allow you to bend your fingers. Long cord-like structures called tendons connect these muscles to the bones in your fingers and thumb. A tunnel of tissue called a tendon sheath surrounds each tendon. This allows the tendon to glide smoothly as the fingers move. The sheath is held in place by bands of tissue called pulleys. They hold the tendon close to the bone for optimal functioning of the tendon. When your flexor muscles contract, the pulleys help guide the tendons to flex or bend your fingers. Normally, the tendons glide smoothly through the pulleys when the fingers flex and extend. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where the pulley at the base of your finger becomes inflamed and swollen. This makes it harder for the tendon to move through the pulley. Over time, the tendon may also swell and form a bump near the pulley. When you bend your finger, the swollen area on the tendon may cause a catching or triggering sensation as it initially gets hung on the pulley and then slips underneath. If not treated, the tendon may swell enough that it cannot pass beneath the pulley. As a result, your finger may get stuck in a bent position. If you have trigger finger, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: a tender lump on your palm at the base of your finger. A catching, popping or locking sensation when you move your finger. And pain when you bend or straighten your finger. The cause of trigger finger isn't known but some conditions that can increase your risk for it include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and repeated injuries, forceful and repetitive hand gripping may also increase your risk. To treat mild trigger finger, your doctor may advise you to rest your hand and avoid activities that make it worse. Your doctor may prescribe antiinflammatory medication or a corticosteroid injection to reduce the swelling. You may also need to wear a finger splint to keep your finger straight. If non-surgical treatments haven't worked, your doctor may advise you to have a surgical procedure. To start the procedure, your surgeon will make a small incision in your palm. Then the pulley will be cut to free the tendon. At the end of the procedure, your incision may be closed with stitches and covered with a soft bandage. To find out more about trigger finger, talk to your healthcare provider.",5,4,5,4,5,4,3,2,4,4,3,4,3,4,3," 5

tVMZNigapmY,"Hello everyone my name is Dr. Jacobs I am a doctor of physical therapy and I am also the inventor of advanced soft tissue release, ASTR specialty. I am a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR. We have now Dr. Gary and he is going to work on Sherwin. He just had ASTR class training and we will see how he is going to do his evaluation and treatment so go ahead. Okay start with where your pain is. Show me. And open. Okay. So let's get a brief history how long this has been going on. How like what's going on. So you have two years of trigger finger. Did you have an injury or? I cannot think of any. Okay. Working nursing home lifting but last year I cannot think of any incident where I injured it. Maybe from work but. So this has been going on for two years. What kind of treatment you had in the last two years? I have had myself, I thought I could get rid of it with exercise. You still have it. Did you have like physical therapy, massage, anything? Okay. I do my own treatment. You are a physical therapist. Yeah. So you have been doing your treatment. Like massage it and you did exercises on it but you still have it. It's getting better but it's still there when I wake up. How much pain now from zero to ten? It's about three. Three. At worse how much pain? In the morning it's still about seven or eight. Okay let's aggravate it now and get the symptoms before and let me see it in the camera here. Okay and open it. You definitely can see the trigger finger. Like it's stuck. Okay so we're going to do the treatment. Dr. Gary is going to work on your finger and then we'll test it again. Okay. Turn it up. Where's the pain right now? In this joint? Okay. Can it open up? Open it up. Okay. So you got some restrictions on the pain. Not pain. Okay. So guys you guys tell us about yourself while you're here. So Sherwin how long have you been practicing? I've been here practicing in California for about 15 years. As a physical therapist? Physical therapist. Okay. So who do you work with? Outpatient? I work in a skilled nursing facility. Mostly geriatric population. I've been in home health for the last three years. But a little tender. Okay. So Gary why are you working? Tell us about yourself. I've been a chiropractor for 14 years and I do home health now. And I was a physical therapy assistant for 15 years before that. So I was the oldest guy in my chiropractic class. So what? Mostly focused on soft tissue work. Didn't do a whole lot of adjusting. So what do you think about the ASTR class? You had three days of class so do you feel you're ready to work on patients? Pretty much yes. It seems to be a lot more efficient. Feel that loosen up? It's moving so much better. That really feels good. Alright. Let us know if you feel any pain okay? Just don't scream in the kitchen. That one is really restricted. You really have a bad case of trigger finger by the way. This is severe. Like I did when I was in high school. 12 So let's use the instrument and we'll. Okay. It doesn't move. It doesn't move. Do you feel you have more grip with the instrument? Easier? Yeah. In some parts. Bigger. There he is. Do you feel that difference? Mm hm. No more. And it's interesting to feel the different areas have different directions of resistance. That's correct. Is it easier to feel it with your hand or the instrument? No it's pretty easy with the instrument. It makes it easier for you? Mm hm. Easier than I thought it would be. Less pain with my hand? Less effort with the instrument you mean? Yes. Yeah, because if you use your hand repetitively with a lot of patients might have arthritis from repetitive strain injury. Overuse. So let's go for A3, A4. We'll get the whole thing. Okay. You guys feel free to switch different persons just to get the feel of working on different body parts. Did you see the trigger finger? Before. It was severe like stuck like this. Oh. Yeah. For two years. More painful proximal? Yeah. Okay. But they're there okay. Oops sorry. You're doing good Johnny. I'll get the whole thing proximal like the whole muscle tendons. Yep yep just get the whole the whole muscle. You'll do it. Really dig in. And you also can use the A4, the A3. Even the bigger one? Uh huh. Okay pressure okay. Can you feel the scar tissue? I can see it here. Right there. Do you guys see it? With the enhancement it's just uneven. It jumps. Yep you can see that exactly. And so you want to. I'll put more lotion. Do you want me to do the side too? Do you want me to do the side more? Yeah. For him. For him. Sometimes. And it's really bad he was just stuck like nothing moving when he make a fist. I feel most of the scar tissue there. Through here. Right here. Make sure you do the antagonist of that finger right in the finger. So you can do the other one. Now would you do the section at a time? Just clean the whole house quickly. Yeah save time. You okay with the pressure? So what happened there? There's kind of scar like right there. What's going on? Maybe I scratch it. Okay so that's good. Let's clean it up and we'll test his range of motion again. So you said your pain was how much at worst when you did the first fist today? About 6. Okay so let's clean that up and just have this in there. Yeah and get your hands up. On your clothes so it will be okay. Alright let's open it. Assuming I'm gripping. Oh wow. Oh my goodness. Yeah it's in the video. Even he's scared. How was it before? It was stuck like this. No resistance. So you couldn't open it? Maybe you could not open it. I will let you guys watch the video. We have it in the video. Awesome. So Sherwin any pain? No pain. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? What do you think actually working on him after 3 days of training? It was so easy. Yeah 3 days of training. Just 3 days. I thought you have to dig more. But you're doing just. Yeah. You were simple. Wow. Yeah awesome. No pain. Zero pain. 4 inches of motion. Can you go slower? Okay let me try again and squeeze. Because this is my problem with squeezing and opening jars. I cannot open it without pain. No more. Beautiful awesome. So what do you guys think? Great. How many minutes? How many minutes? You did a great job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

The video also contains a lot of unnecessary chatter and does not provide clear instructions on how to perform the technique or how to diagnose the condition."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The author, Dr. Jacobs, mentions that he uses over 400 research studies in his ASTR class, but he does not provide any specific references or citations to those studies in the video. Additionally, the video does not mention any other sources of information beyond the author's own experience and invention of ASTR. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The transcript is mostly clear when the information used or reported in the video was produced. However, there are some parts that are not clear, such as the specific details of the patient's injury, the exact steps of the treatment, and the exact dates of the production. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 2

The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The transcript shows a conversation between a medical expert (Dr. Jacobs) and another healthcare provider (Dr. Gary) discussing a treatment method (ASTR) for a patient with trigger finger. The video demonstrates the treatment process and its effects on the patient. However, the video is also promotional in nature, as it is hosted by Dr. Jacobs, the inventor of ASTR, and it encourages viewers to subscribe to his channel and register for ASTR classes. The video does not provide a comprehensive overview of other treatment options or a balanced comparison of the effectiveness of ASTR versus other methods. Therefore, the video is not entirely balanced and unbiased."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information. The speaker mentions that there are over 170 videos on his channel, most of which are real treatment videos. He also encourages healthcare providers to register for ASTR class, where he uses over 400 research studies to guide the treatment. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive list of sources or a clear explanation of how to access them, so it is not a complete or detailed source of information."," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the doctor is unsure about the cause of the patient's trigger finger, as he mentions that the patient has not had any recent injuries or incidents that could have caused it. Second, the doctor is unsure about the effectiveness of previous treatments, as he asks the patient if he has tried physical therapy, massage, or anything else. Third, the doctor is unsure about the severity of the patient's condition, as he describes it as ""severe"" and ""bad"" and notes that it has been going on for two years. Finally, the doctor is unsure about the outcome of the treatment, as he asks the patient about his pain level after the treatment and expresses surprise at the improvement. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty and deserves a score of 5."," 4

Explanation: The video does describe some aspects of how the treatment works, but it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the treatment process or the underlying principles.

Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video does describe some benefits of the treatment, such as the ease of use, the lack of pain during the procedure, and the improvement in the patient's condition. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the benefits, nor does it compare the treatment to other options. Additionally, the video is primarily focused on demonstrating the treatment rather than explaining its benefits. Therefore, the score is 4, which indicates that the video partially describes the benefits of the treatment."," 4

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear description of the risks of each treatment. It mainly focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the ASTR treatment on a patient with trigger finger. The video does not mention any potential side effects or complications that may arise from the treatment. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 5

Explanation: The video does describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The patient, Sherwin, had a severe case of trigger finger for two years, and the video shows the pain and restricted movement he experienced before the treatment. The video also demonstrates the improvement in his condition after the ASTR treatment, with no pain and increased range of motion."," 5

Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video shows a medical expert, Dr. Jacobs, using the advanced soft tissue release (ASTR) technique to treat a patient with trigger finger. The patient experiences significant improvement in pain and mobility after the treatment. The video also demonstrates how the treatment can be performed by other healthcare professionals after a short training period. The video highlights the benefits of the treatment in terms of reducing pain and improving quality of life for the patient."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video shows one specific treatment method (ASTR) being used on a patient with trigger finger. However, it does not explicitly mention other possible treatment options or compare ASTR to other treatments. The video does show that the patient had tried other treatments before, such as exercise and massage, but it does not discuss whether these were the only options or if there are other treatments that could be effective."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making in the sense that it shows a doctor discussing the patient's condition and treatment options with another healthcare provider. However, the video is mostly focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of a specific treatment method (ASTR) and promoting the ASTR class for healthcare providers. The video does not provide much information about the patient's preferences, values, or potential alternatives to the treatment, which would be more consistent with a high level of shared decision-making.",{8},201
Ej8FwzKnmHo,"Trigger finger and trigger thumb. Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured. When releasing the A1 poly, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The A2 and A4 polys are important structures and should not be touched, excised or released. Only A1 poly is cut and released and the flexor tendon is released. Surgical release. How do you release the A1 poly? The procedure is done with local anesthesia to allow intraoperative assessment and to communicate with the patient to confirm that adequate release was done. Here there is a surgical case. The incision is marked out in the palmar crease for surgical division of the A1 poly. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery and the fingers are usually marked on the palmar aspect and the dorsal aspect. The A1 poly is exposed and released. Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis. How about trigger thumb? This is the incision for the surgical release of trigger thumb. The incision for trigger thumb is placed in the MP flexion crease. When releasing the flexor pollicis longus tendon, watch out for the digital radion nerve. It's in the field of surgery. Thank you very much. I hope that was helpful.

EAzo4iF4dv0,"Hi, this is Dr. Levi here at Glendale Outpatient Surgery Center with another one of our really wonderful instructional videos. So today we'll be talking about trigger finger also called stenosyptinosynovitis. A patient will present with one of their fingers locked in this position. This happens and occurs because the A1 pulley or the flexor tendon sheath, there's edema and fibrosis in this area causing the tendon to be trapped under the A1 pulley and they're unable to extend the thumb completely. It'll flex down but they cannot extend it. Now this can occur with any of the fingers. Why people develop trigger finger, no one knows why exactly. However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane. Both of these work very effective. The Kenalog is a steroid and the Markane is the analgesic. So with that said, if the steroid injection is not effective, then the last treatment modality would be surgical intervention which would be release of the A1 pulley. It's a very, very effective surgical procedure. It takes approximately three to five minutes to do properly and it's quite effective for most patients. Let's talk about some lifestyle change that you may want to consider if you have trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. Exercise every day. Stay healthy. Drink more water. Eat more fruits, nuts, vegetables and grains. Of course, attempt to do those stretching exercises that I showed you at least two or three times a day. These are things that I think can help you on your journey if you have and if you develop trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis.",4,3,4,3,4,4,2,4,4,4,3,2,3,4,2," 4

DISCFr0YeiM,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. Usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",4,4,4,4,5,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,2," 4

The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. Discrepancy between the diameter of the tendon and the size of the pulley causing the triggering. Symptoms. Pain located at the palm at the base of the finger. Tenderness at the a1 pulley. It occurs more in women, more in diabetics, also in rheumatoid arthritis. It can be from repetitive injuries or occupational. Locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed, it gets caught. Treatment. Rest is planting injection into the sheath. Do not inject into the tendon. Injection can be repeated. Surgical release of a1 pulley at the last resort. When you are releasing the a1 pulley, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The a2-a4 pulleys are important. They should not be touched, excised or released. Only a1 pulley is caught and released and the tendon is released. Technique for injections. Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the pulley. Go with the needle straight forward at 90 degree to the tendon. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication into the sheath or the pulley freely. How do you release the a1 pulley? Incision is made on the MP flexion crease. Here is a surgical case. The incision is marked in the palmar crease for the surgical division of the a1 pulley. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery. The a1 pulley is exposed and released. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appear released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the operation. How about trigger thumb?

_DVTsOZREPY,"Trigger finger, or stenosing tinnocinnovitis, is a common condition seen by hand surgeons. It's caused by swelling in the flexor tendons, which bend your fingers into your palm. Sometimes, if the tendon is too swollen, it can cause the finger to get stuck and be very painful when you try and straighten it. Trigger finger can occur after a period of overuse, but can also have an insidious onset without a history of overuse injury of the hands. It occurs because the flexor tendons at the base of your finger enter a series of pulleys, or tunnels, and the swollen tendon can get caught on the edge of the tunnel as you bend and straighten your finger. When the swollen tendon gets stuck on one side of the tunnel, patients often have to force their finger straight, which can be very painful. It is common for catching or locking of the digit to be worse at night or in the morning while the tendon is more swollen. This is because when you sleep at night, tendons tend to swell a little bit more, and the swelling may resolve throughout the day, causing less catching or locking of your fingers. Trigger finger is very common. It is associated with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis. However, trigger finger occurs frequently in patients without a history of these conditions. Typically, there are four stages of a trigger finger. Initially, the patient may have tenderness to palpation at the base of their finger at the level of the first pulley or entrance to the tunnel. Next, the patient may notice that their finger has a catching sensation as they flex and extend their finger. Third, the patient may experience locking of the finger, where they have to manually straighten their finger, and this is usually associated with a painful pop. Finally, when the inflammation is very severe, the finger will remain fixed and locked in an extended position. At this point, it is often too painful for the patient to bend their finger into their palm. If you begin to experience symptoms similar to a trigger finger, you can first try at-home care by resting, icing, and stretching the finger. Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or aspirin may also help reduce pain. If your pain won't go away or gets worse, then it may be time to make an appointment with a hand surgeon to be properly diagnosed. Often, trigger finger can be treated successfully without surgery. The typical first line of treatment is a steroid injection to the affected finger. The injection decreases the amount of inflammation within the tendon, therefore allowing the tendon to glide more smoothly through the tunnel. Generally, two out of three patients will have a successful result from the steroid injection, and no further treatment may be necessary. Sometimes, the steroid injection may last for several months, and another steroid injection can be administered to the area as symptoms recur. If the finger continues to trigger after two to three steroid injections, or if the injection does not provide long-lasting relief, your surgeon may recommend surgical release of the A1 pulley. Surgery involves cutting the roof of the tunnel, which allows the tendon to glide more smoothly. A trigger finger release can typically be performed under just local anesthetic, with minimal discomfort following surgery.",4,4,5,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,5,4," 4

FyUzORrK75g,"Let's take a look at trigger finger surgery. Trigger finger is one of the most common conditions that a hand surgeon treats. Of course, most commonly from frequent keyboard use, as you can see here, frequent texting, anything repetitive that causes the fingers or thumbs to move can cause this problem. As you can see here, this is the actual, it's a painful triggering condition where the finger snaps back and forth. The ring finger is most common but can occur in any digit. Now let's take a look at an animated anatomical picture here. The blue structures are the flexor tendons. There's two to each finger and one to the thumb. And they go through a little, these white bands, what we call pulleys. And it's within these bands that you get the mechanical advantage to be able to bend the fingers into the palm. As you can see from this picture, the fingers are being bent into the palm. And now as we straighten, you can see, again, the tendons are moving back and forth. Now what happens is from repetitive use, you get a little nodule that forms in the palm on one of the tendons. And that nodule becomes larger over time from repeated friction. And much like a little knot in a rope trying to go through a pulley, this nodule starts ramming into the flexor sheath or pulley system. And it actually can grate back and forth causing this popping of the joint just beyond that, or the middle joint in the finger. In severe cases, the finger can actually become locked straight. But more commonly, it's locked in a bent position. Now initially when the patient comes in, we will do a cortisone shot, effective in about 50% of cases. But you will see from an animated video here, we'll actually show you the surgical procedure. We make a little cut, local anesthetic, about a five minute outpatient procedure, a little light sedation. We actually cut the band that's impeding the tendon. And we open that up. That allows the finger to bend. We place several sutures, two or three, four sutures in place, and a little light dressing. Now an actual picture or video of a patient undergoing this procedure, you can see here, putting the scissors right underneath this white structure here. The retractors are in place. We're snipping with the scissors, that band. You can see a great picture here of that actual opening up of that band. In this case of this patient, she had no flexion. Upon releasing her tendon immediately, once we awakened her during the procedure, she could bend the thumb. So after the procedure, it's about 10 days with a little light dressing or band aid over the incision. You're moving it right away. Sutures come out 10 days later. And then it's about a four week total recovery, just because it's a sensitive skin to place a cut on the hand. So it's about four weeks, give or take, for all the soreness to go away. But activity is tolerated. Now, there's very little chance of recurrence with this condition. But what you will see, it'll pop up in other fingers over time. One is several months later, just from using the other hand or the same hand, you can get repetitive motion. And another one comes up.

0VSxtk1oQ2s,"Hey everyone, Dr. McClellan. I wanted to show you a great video that I took on trigger finger injection. Learning how to inject a trigger finger well is an important part of just routine clinic in plastic surgery or hand surgery. And I wanted to show you how I do it. It may be different than the way that you do it and hopefully a couple of the tips are helpful for you. I'll put up here, I've never done it before, but I'll try to put right there an article from Journal of Hand Surgery showing trigger finger is very effective at relieving initial symptoms of trigger finger with a little steroid shot of Kenalog 40 and some lidocaine. I like to stay right in the middle of the finger so that you're not near the nerve-vascular bundle which tend to be in the sulcus along the side of the tendons. So if you stay right over the tendon, you're pretty safe. I'll show you how to get the tendon into the right plane and I'll show you on a schematic where that plane is. And some of the tips that I do that I think gives me good steroid injections and prevents other complications. I tend to mix Kenalog 40 and lidocaine together. I use the lidocaine as kind of a diagnostic if the pain goes away of the node-as-node going under the A1 pulley, then generally the steroid is in the right place and they will get relief in a couple of weeks. As always, I hope you like the video. If you like it, give it a thumbs up, share the video and thanks so much for watching. Have a great day. Okay. So let's say this is your tendon and here is your pulley. The space where you want to be is right in here, okay, between the pulley and the tendon. That's where you want to deliver the steroid. So if you bring your needle in, okay, and the needle point goes into the tendon, when you wiggle the finger, this needle will move back and forth and that way you can tell that you're in the tendon. And so then what you do is you simply back up a little bit, okay, and until the tendon stops or until the needle stops moving with the tendon and then you gently press down on the plunger and you can get the steroid and local anesthetic right into that space which is where you want to be. So lidocaine plane, Kinlog, O1CC syringe. I like a larger needle to draw it up and then like a 27 to inject it. And I do not push it out of the end until I'm ready to inject because it'll clot the needle off. Okay, we're doing middle finger and ring finger, correct? Okay Rachel, let's see if you can come more over it. Okay, and he clicks right there. You can feel it and right there. So sir, what I'm going to do is go in with the needle and then I'll talk to you as I do it, okay? Okay. So now when I'm ready to go in, I will squirt out a little bit, okay? And I'm going to come down right in the middle of the finger. Stick? Are you okay? Mm-hmm. So I come down, wiggle the tip of your finger a little bit. See it moving? Okay, so that's too far. So I'm going to back off of that a little bit and I'm going to just really easily push it in. And it should go in nice and easy. And I do about 0.4, okay? I'm going to come over to this side. Go in, about right there. Stick. Wiggle the tip of your finger. So that's not in yet. I'm going to go in a little bit further and then I felt it right there. And it's, I mean, your resistance, I back up a little bit and now I'm right in the sheath. Okay? Now I'm going to have you make a fist for me. Extend it out, make a fist, extend it out.",4,3,4,3,4,2,2,4,4,3,2,2,2,4,2," 4

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The doctor explains the procedure and shows the steps in detail, including the anatomical landmarks and the technique for injecting the steroid. However, there are some parts where the audio is not very clear, and it is difficult to understand what the doctor is saying. Additionally, the video could have used more visual aids, such as diagrams or animations, to help viewers better understand the procedure. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' clear."," 2

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased because it provides some useful information about trigger finger injection and the doctor's technique. However, it also lacks some important elements, such as mentioning potential risks and complications of the procedure, discussing alternative treatments, or providing a clear disclaimer that the video is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as medical advice. Additionally, the video seems to promote the doctor's own approach to the procedure, which may not be the only valid way to perform the injection."," 2

The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, such as mentioning an article from the Journal of Hand Surgery and explaining the technique of injecting a trigger finger. However, it does not provide a comprehensive list of resources or a clear explanation of how to access them. Additionally, the video focuses more on the demonstration of the injection technique rather than providing a thorough overview of the topic. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several ways. First, the doctor mentions that the way he does the injection may be different from other doctors, implying that there may be multiple correct methods. Second, he refers to an article from the Journal of Hand Surgery that shows trigger finger injections are effective, but he does not provide any specific details about the study or its results, leaving some uncertainty about the evidence behind the procedure. Third, the doctor uses terms like ""I like to"" and ""I tend to"" when describing his technique, indicating that these are his personal preferences rather than established guidelines. Finally, the doctor asks the patient if he feels the needle and if it goes in easily, suggesting that he is not entirely confident in his ability to accurately position the needle. Overall, the video contains some elements of uncertainty, but it is not overly vague or ambiguous."," 4

The video does a good job of describing the process of trigger finger injection, including the location of the injection, the type of steroid used, and the technique for delivering the steroid.

aSt5GuiIGf8,"I'm Dr. Arnold Batson. We're here in the operating room at St. Francis Eastside Surgery Center. We have a patient that has triggering of her index and long fingers. This lady has a trigger finger of both her index and her long fingers today. That means that the fingers, when she closes them down, sometimes stick and won't open very well and sometimes even have to be pried open. We're going to make a small incision, go into the flexor tendon sheath that gets tied around the tendons and release the tendon sheath so that the rough part of the tendon can slide through that again without causing the locking or the catching. We're preparing to do the surgery now. This lady's been prepped with disinfectant for the skin. I've marked where we're going to make the proposed incision and she's already numb and anesthetized. So making the incision, get some little bit of bleeding from some little small vessels, then some spreading to get down to the tendon sheath. This is the tendon sheath, the white structure that's running through there. I know it's in a hole and it may be difficult to see, but that's the band that we're going to cut. Okay, we've made a small incision in the sheath. Now we're going to enlarge that or lengthen it a bit. When you're doing this operation, you have to watch out for the little small nerves that run on either side of the tendon and tendon sheath and protect those. We've just opened the tendon sheath and now we're lifting the tendons up out of the bed that they sit in. You may be able to see them move as we move the finger. Here's the split area or the little frayed area that binds or catches as the tendon slides through the sheath. We just do a little touch-up smoothing that. That ensures that it glides well inside. Now the sheath's been released. The tendon can move well through there. So that one is fixed now. This one is similar. It may be even more difficult to see from the angle that the camera's positioned. This is the tendon sheath, again the whitish structure that's in there, and making a little small opening into it. These tendons look like they're going to be pretty frayed also when we get them out to take a look at them. Okay. One of the tendons looks pretty good. It's nice and smooth, but there's a lot of fraying in this little bit of splitting in the other tendon that's likely the cause of the problems in this one. There's the reddish streak. There's the split in the tendon that's probably the cause of the locking and catching with this one. The problem with this is a degenerative wear and tear of the tendons. It's a little worse than people that have diabetes for some reason, but it occurs in almost everyone to some, all professions and all sexes, both male and female, have problems with this. So this one's completed now. It's back in its little sheath and sliding well through there. So now we're ready to close up the incision. We'll wash it out. And for these we use some little small absorbable buried stitches and then cover the wound or the incision with Dermabond or Surgeseal or another type of surgical adhesive so that the patient can usually start washing the hand or taking a shower in about 48 hours. The procedure does make the fingers sore and stiff for a few days and normally I would tell most patients that it takes around two to two and a half weeks to pretty well recover from this altogether. Here. This type of incision causes very little scarring. Even though this one is four centimeters or so long, the palm heals very nicely and makes very little scar as opposed to incisions elsewhere on the body where the scarring is much more obvious. We've gotten the incision closed now, so we're going to put a local anesthetic in that will keep this numb for the next three or four hours before the feeling all comes back so that the patient doesn't leave here having some burning or stinging in the area. Okay, we just applied the surgical adhesive or the substance that's going to keep this sealed and snug together for the next several days. We've finished the procedure now. Dressings are applied and from here the patient's going to go to the recovery room for a few minutes. Probably in 30 minutes or 45 minutes she'll be ready to leave and go home. In about 48 hours she can remove the dressing and then she can go to the in about 48 hours she can remove the dressings and begin rinsing her hand in running water, taking a shower, but not submerging it in bath water or dish water for several days. She can use her fingers. They'll be a little tender or sore at first, but fairly quickly she can get back to normal usage. I'll see her back in the office in nine or ten days and make sure everything's healing well. And frequently for this procedure that's the only time that I need to see the patient back. If they're having any particular problems getting the movement or getting their fingers closed completely down into a clenched fist, I will see them again in another two or three weeks to make sure that they've fully recovered that. But most patients it goes pretty quickly for this type of operation.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

0MckpiWxrN4,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb it's a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteries. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. At this time I'm cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient has had a very long standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thin fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,2," 4

Tt1-_eNMC9Y,"Hello, this is Dr. Janusz. This next video is going to be a trigger finger release. We're going to be releasing the A1 pulley of this patient's finger, which is what causes the trigger. The surgery, as usual, starts with the marking of my incision with a skin marker. Here you'll see I'm palpating the A1 pulley. You can feel this in your own hand as the pea-sized knot right in this location. People who have trigger fingers, this is often enlarged and extremely tender. You actually have several options in this particular incision. You can do a diagonal incision, you can do a straight on incision, and some people do one that is transversely across the palm. Testing the anesthesia with some forceps, making sure that the patient is comfortable, and the skin incision is made with a 15 blade scalpel. As in with most of the other surgeries that you'll be watching, there are always important structures immediately below the skin, especially in the hand. You have to be very careful when making a decision not to plunge deep down into those structures, and therefore we proceed nice and slow, dissecting down and identifying nerves and arteries that need to be preserved. The dissection is taken down through to the A1 pulley, and as I encounter any small blood vessels, those are cauterized with bipolar cauterine. Using scissors to gently spread down to the A1 pulley, I'm being careful to protect the digital nerves and arteries. This is a trigger finger retractor, which you see just go in. Now I'm getting a few final bands of fibrous tissue off of the A1 pulley, so that I can see the pulley clearly and divide it. The camera is showing an excellent view of the A1 pulley. It's the white structure that I'm pointing at now with my freer elevator. You can also see, if you look closely, the white line between the pulley and the tendon, which is slightly more yellow. Right there is the end of the pulley. The pulley is then divided longitudinally. Here I'm using a beaver blade to start the cut, and then I will come back in with some littler scissors and finish that. You're now seeing the flexor tendon, which is nicely displayed after the A1 pulley is retracted off of it. I'm then using some scissors to just gently push away the leaflets of the A1 pulley. Now I'm picking up the pulley with my forceps to demonstrate the anatomy. The digital nerves and arteries are just on the outside of this. I also use a retractor to pick up both flexor tendons to the finger and make sure that there's no fibrous connection between them. There's often quite a bit of scarring between both tendons and somebody who has a severe A1 pulley disease, and I like to break up those adhesions prior to finishing the surgery. This patient's finger is nice and smooth and the triggering is gone. Oftentimes the patient will be awake during this and just under local anesthetic. In those situations we can actually ask the patient to move their finger and demonstrate that the triggering is now gone. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and now we're going to be closing this with some nylon sutures. I'm going to be using a horizontal mattress technique. These sutures are usually left in for eight days. We allow the patient to take down their dressing at day four and cover these with a band-aid. The patient in the recovery room starts doing some exercises immediately, keeping the finger moving, and is asked to make fists at least 10 times an hour until follow-up. Some zero form dressing is then applied over the wound and that's the end of this trigger finger release. Hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for watching.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,2," 4

iqw1TDyzvjo,"I began to perform percutaneous releases of trigger fingers about 35 years ago as a technique to release remaining bands following an open procedure without another operation. This was soon adapted to initial procedures. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be done in an office setting effectively with minimal morbidity. After the first presentation at a national meeting, there was a general reluctance to perform the procedure. This continues until the present time and appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves. The procedure has evolved over the past 35 years. This short video will demonstrate the procedure with emphasis on safety and effectiveness. The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique. The vertical orientation of the needle tip is also maintained by identifying the position of the syringe with a needle in the vertical position before insertion. This technique I have dubbed the Pressure Push Method. Specifically placing the needle point underneath the flexor tendon sheath is avoided to avoid cutting the flexor tendon. Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy. In general most patients do better than those with an open procedure.",4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

FrQpFy7grtY,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",4,4,5,4,5,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,2," 4

9RO2LJKVQZo,"This is Rashara Dages discussing today a trigger thumb or A1 pulley release. Here we're making our transverse incision here in the flexor crease along the area of the A1 pulley. Care is taken with our incision to ensure that we only go just deep enough to get to the subcutaneous tissue. This is to ensure that we do not injure the radial neurovascular bundle. Using small double hooks, we're able to dissect with care taken again to remove the tissue but get down to the flexor tendon sheath. The pulley is now identified and an attempt is made to identify the radial nerve and neurovascular structures. You can see the nerve there. So a crowd retractor is then placed in to retract the nerve. Here you can see the pulley and you can see the proximal edge of the pulley is illustrated here by our scissor. We will use a knife to incise the proximal edge extending distally. Here we can see the pulley begin to open. We then use a tonotomy scissor to complete the release distally. Care is taken again not to injure the tendon or disrupt the neurovascular bundle and now proximally the release is completed as well. The pulley leaflets are easily identified and they're easy to note complete release because of the redundancy that is now in the leaflets. Any residual catching or triggering which is noted with active flexion is then released. Here again we can see smooth motion of the tendon itself and now the skin is closed using a 3-0 nylon suture. Two mattress sutures typically take care of the closure. Soft dressing is in place and patient is allowed active motion of the IP joint immediately. Sutures are removed typically in 10 to 14 days and from that point activity is unrestricted.",4,4,4,2,4,5,2,2,5,4,4,2,2,5,2," 4

m0Wu6rd9ItA,"In mild cases of trigger finger, anti-inflammatory medication may be helpful. However, usually the standard for conservative treatment is a cortisone shot directly into the tendon to reduce inflammation. Within three to five days, you should know if this is going to be successful. However, if conservative treatment fails, a surgical option is a quick, simple procedure where the band overlying the tendon is snipped, thereby relieving pressure on the tendon and relieving the problem. With trigger finger surgery, a one centimeter incision is made after IV sedation is administered in the operating room and a local anesthetic. After a tiny incision here in the palm, a small band is clipped, relieving pressure on the tendon. Within minutes, you are asked to actively flex and extend the fingers, assuring there is no further popping at that time. Then you are taken to the recovery room and within 30 minutes to an hour, you are on your way home. The recovery following trigger finger surgery is rapid, usually returning to full movement within several days and full activities within several weeks. You may have persistent pain or soreness where the cut is across the palm for up to six weeks. After trigger finger surgery, it is very unusual to have a recurrence and is one of the few problems in the hand that actually usually does not recur after surgery.

8LMg4PX1VJc,"This is David Drake reviewing a short video of a trigger finger A1 pulley release on the long finger. The typical incision that I like is a transverse incision in the distal palmar crease. The nodules on these tendons are usually palpable and the incision is made over the nodule. The incision is usually in the 1 cm range. The skin is opened and deeper dissections are accomplished with the scissors using a spreading technique. The spreading is done along the long axis of the digit with care not to injure any neurovascular structures. A superficial palmar fascia is released and the A1 pulley is then identified. Once the pulley is identified it is incised and opened. Depending on the nature of the tendon nodule, a portion of the pulley may be removed or a synonym around the tendon may be resected as well. A complete release of the A1 pulley is accomplished. The finger is checked for triggering. The fondness of the tendon is also looked at to be sure there is no nodularity associated. In this case there was extra synonym around the tendon and this was removed. The wound is enclosed with floral monofilament usually in a mattress fashion to divert the skin edges. The patient is placed in a light dressing without splinting and is encouraged to move from day 1.

AQCoMbYRaUo,"this little product can make a big impact on your finger if it is triggering. So it comes in different sizes. I have two sizes here with me. They say the size on the back. This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping. Because then when you wake up, you may notice, oh, no, it's back to where it was. When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area. If you want to try the oval eight splint to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger, I think this could help you. Four to six weeks is going to be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your finger. And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities.

c0X9E9AeSUQ,"By the end of this video you're going to learn how to fix trigger finger in about five minutes. My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that. The problem is that has a very poor success rate for the most part. The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back. So it's not the greatest solution. You want to get to this problem earlier. The sooner you can treat it with Graston, the sooner you can treat it with stretching and the sooner you can get that brace and splint on your finger, the better off you're going to be. So if you have any questions regarding this and you'd like to talk to me personally about your situation, we are offering zoom appointments. So we can do a zoom appointment or we can do a telephone consultation. My information is down below where you can find my website and my contact information.

UVR865Fhq1w,"This is David Drake, I'm going to review a case of A1 pulling release on the thumb. Typically this is done with a transverse incision, overlying the nodule. A nodule is usually easily palpable in the flexor crease at the base of the thumb. A 1cm incision is then marked out and made with a 15 blade. Once the skin is in a deeper section, it is accomplished with a spreading technique. The flexor tendon lays beneath this area as does the additional nerve. This is easily identified in this video and kept out of harm's way. Once the sheath is identified, it is opened using a 15 blade. In this case we excised a portion of the sheath. I don't always do that. It depends on the nature of the sheath and the construction. In this case the sheath was quite thick and was causing some difficulty. We had free range of motion at the conclusion of sheath excision. No catching nor nodule was seen on the tendon. Closure was accomplished with interrupted monofilament suture, usually in a mattress fashion to avert these thick skin edges. The patient is given instructions to begin moving immediately and is not restricted from motion until day one. Sutures come out in two weeks. No splinters used, just a light dressing.",4,4,4,2,4,4,2,2,4,4,3,2,2,4,2," 4

JtqGbwJAAVU,"Trigger finger is a common painful hand condition that results in locking of a finger when the patient makes a fist. The following video demonstrates a surgical procedure called trigger finger release. The surgery is typically performed under an injection of local anesthetic. A rubber band is applied to the hand and wrist, and a tourniquet stops any bleeding so that the important structures can be easily visualized in surgery. A diagonal incision is made on the palm. The tissues are gently dissected. Retractors help to protect the important nerve and vessel branches. This is a transverse sling called a pulley. When it becomes inflamed, it constricts the flexor tendon. Incising the pulley with a scalpel and scissors releases the flexor tendon. The flexor tendon is pulled up from the incision and inspected. There is no more triggering or locking when the tendon is pulled. Passive flexion and extension of the finger is unimpeded. The patient also flexes and extends the finger, and there is completely normal movement of the affected finger. Previous triggering no longer exists and is not palpable. Triggering usually does not recur after the release. The incision is closed with two or three stitches. The hand is wrapped in a light bandage.

And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon. I don't think it's going to be one of these two-day things, but even this just gets in my way. But I think that when this comes off that it won't be long and that will be pretty much my PT is typing, playing, and the million other things that I do. Although just to start with I'll be doing things like this. That's it. See you around. That's easy to turn this off. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",4,4,4,3,4,4,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video aims to show the process of having a trigger finger repaired, the surgery, and the aftermath.

Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'",set(),224
I7svkSrtW5I,"Here you can see the anatomy of a normal, uninjured thumb. The synovial tendon sheath and the tendon are clearly shown. Inflammation of the tendon sheath is known as stenosing tinosinovitis. Stenosing tinosinovitis of the thumb, often referred to as trigger thumb, is one of the more common abnormalities of the hand. This condition is associated with painful triggering or locking of the thumb. When the patient tries to straighten the thumb, the nodule jams beneath the pulley proximally. This occurs with a painful snap, much like a trigger being pulled and released, with either flexion or extension of the thumb. Small changes in the tendon's diameter will have a significant effect on the function of the thumb. The nodule is usually pulled proximally to the pulley with active thumb flexion. That includes anti-inflammatory medication and injection. Inject into the sheath, not the tendon. Put the needle obliquely towards the tendon. Withdraw the needle slightly and inject freely into the sheath. Ultrasound guided injection of the tendon sheath and pulley may be of benefit. The needle is inserted into the sheath above the tendon and fluid is injected. If symptoms persist, consider surgery. Release the pulley to allow active motion without triggering. Note the position of the radial digital nerve close to the incision. Everything seems to be fine with this thumb, but there's definitely something tricky going on with this one. Hello doctor, got something crazy going on with my thumb. Can you take a look at it? Come right away. All my videos and this video is for educational purposes only.

IbkjoYkJKGg,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Jacobs. I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release, ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. Tell me what's going on with your fingers. So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like… It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

iKjPKT5sHkw,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,2," 4

The video is mainly focused on demonstrating the surgery itself, but it does not provide any context or resources for viewers to explore further."," 2

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several parts. For example, the narrator mentions that they are feeling around for the A1 pulley, which implies that they may not be completely certain about its location. Additionally, the narrator says that they are trying to clean off dense attachments to the A1 pulley and that they are trying to fully divide the pulley, which suggests that there may be some uncertainty about the extent of the adhesions and the best way to release the pulley. Finally, the narrator says that they are trying to look further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released, which indicates that they are not completely certain that they have released all of the adhesions. Therefore, the video refers to areas of uncertainty, but not to a great extent, so the score is 2."," 4

Explanation: The video provides a detailed description of the trigger thumb release surgery, including the incision, dissection, and division of the A1 pulley. However, it does not explain how the treatment works or what happens after the surgery to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes the benefits of the trigger thumb release surgery in terms of improving thumb mobility and reducing the symptoms of trigger thumb. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different treatments for trigger thumb, such as non-surgical options or alternative surgical techniques. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video describes the risks of the specific treatment (trigger thumb release) to some extent, but it does not cover the general risks of surgery or the alternative treatments. The video focuses on the technical aspects of the surgery and the doctor's experience, which is informative but does not address the broader question of risks. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only shows the process of a trigger thumb release surgery. The transcript focuses on the steps of the surgery, the tools used, and the patient's experience during the procedure. There is no mention of the consequences of not treating a trigger thumb or the natural progression of the condition without intervention."," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It only shows a specific surgical procedure for trigger thumb release. The video does not mention any alternatives to surgery, the potential risks and benefits of the procedure, or how the patient's quality of life might improve after the surgery. Therefore, the score is 2, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor explains the process of the surgery, but does not explicitly mention other treatment options. However, the fact that he is performing surgery implies that there may be other ways to treat the condition, such as non-surgical methods."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the surgery, but it does not involve the patient or their preferences in the decision-making process. The video is mainly focused on demonstrating the surgical procedure and does not address shared decision-making.",{8},227
RKE8LESi83o,"Trigger finger is a condition that often causes locking of any finger of the hand. Most commonly, trigger finger affects the ring finger and the thumb. It's also called synosyntinosynovitis, but it's obviously easier to call it trigger finger. What happens in this condition is the tendons that allow us to move our hands like this actually get stuck, so to speak, in the sheath, the covering of the tendon, or basically the tunnel that they have to travel through in order for us to be able to move our fingers freely. A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely. In theory, that sounds nice, but the reality is that steroid shots actually increase risk of tendon rupture, which is why people are limited to the number of steroid shots that they could get each year. And people with trigger finger a lot of times may undergo a steroid shot only to find that everything just really comes right back sometime later. Maybe they get a second steroid shot, the same thing happens, and then eventually they're recommended for surgery. What we do is oftentimes a combination of what we call a hydrodissection procedure along with prolotherapy. And what that involves is using a non-steroid injection actually into that tendon sheath to draw off swelling, kind of unstick any adhesions that might be there from chronic overuse, and allow that tendon to move more freely through that tunnel. Prolotherapy may also be warranted in these cases because a lot of times what we see is, let's say someone has trigger finger of their ring finger, it often goes hand in hand with injury, arthritis, or things to any of these joints along the path of that tendon. And so by doing a hydrodissection procedure to kind of free up that tendon in that tunnel, and then also doing prolotherapy to strengthen any joint or fix any injury in these fingers, those procedures work really well hand in hand to get trigger finger to resolve.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are mostly clear, but there are some parts that could be explained more clearly. For example, the term ""hydrodissection procedure"" is not defined, and the connection between prolotherapy and resolving trigger finger is not explicitly explained. However, the overall message of the video is that there are alternative treatments for trigger finger that are safer and more effective than steroid shots, which is clear."," 4

Explanation: The video achieves its aims partially. It provides a clear explanation of what trigger finger is, its causes, and the conventional treatment options. However, it does not provide any information about the hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy, which are the alternative treatments that the speaker claims to offer. The video could be improved by providing more details about these alternative treatments, such as how they work, their benefits, and their risks."," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses a medical condition (trigger finger) and its treatment options. However, it is not a perfect match for the question, as it focuses more on the alternative treatments rather than the condition itself. The video could be more relevant if it provided more information about the causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some information about the sources used to compile the publication, but it is not very clear or detailed. The author mentions that they use a ""combination of what we call a hydrodissection procedure along with prolotherapy,"" but does not provide any references or citations for these procedures. Additionally, the author does not mention any other sources of information, such as research studies or expert opinions, that were used to inform the content of the video.

The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The transcript provides a detailed explanation of trigger finger, its causes, and the treatment options available. The medical expert explains the condition in simple terms and provides information on the risks and benefits of different treatment options. However, the transcript could be improved by providing some visual aids or diagrams to help viewers better understand the anatomy and mechanism of trigger finger."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript is mostly balanced and unbiased, as it presents different treatment options for trigger finger and explains the pros and cons of each. However, it does lean slightly towards promoting the hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy as the best solution, which may indicate some bias. Overall, the transcript is informative and provides a good overview of the condition and its treatment options."," 3

The video provides some details about additional sources of support and information, such as the hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy, but it does not provide any specific references or citations to support the effectiveness of these treatments. The video also does not mention any other alternative treatments or recommendations for people with trigger finger. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

The video does refer to areas of uncertainty. The uncertainty is present in the effectiveness of steroid shots, which may provide temporary relief but increase the risk of tendon rupture, and the long-term success of surgery. The video also mentions the combination of hydrodissection and prolotherapy as a potential solution, but it does not provide definitive evidence for its effectiveness."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how each treatment works. It explains that steroid shots are used to decrease inflammation but can increase the risk of tendon rupture. It also mentions that hydrodissection and prolotherapy are used to unstick the adhesions and strengthen the joints, respectively. However, the video does not provide a detailed explanation of how hydrodissection and prolotherapy work or how they are performed."," 4

Explanation: The video describes the benefits of the hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy treatments for trigger finger. However, it does not mention any benefits of the steroid shot treatment, which is also a common treatment for trigger finger. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video does describe some risks associated with steroid shots, such as an increased risk of tendon rupture. However, it does not mention any risks associated with the hydrodissection procedure or prolotherapy. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially.'"," 2

The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only discusses the treatment options for trigger finger, such as steroid shots and surgery. The video does not mention any consequences or outcomes of not receiving any treatment for trigger finger."," 4

The video does partially describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains that steroid shots may provide temporary relief but increase the risk of tendon rupture and may not be a long-term solution. The video also describes a different treatment approach involving a hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy, which aims to improve the quality of life by reducing inflammation and improving the function of the affected finger. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different treatment options or their long-term effects on quality of life."," 4

The video is partially clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mentions steroid shots as a common initial treatment, but it also discusses a hydrodissection procedure and prolotherapy as alternative or additional treatments. However, the video does not explicitly state that these are the only possible treatment choices, nor does it discuss other potential treatments that may exist."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by explaining the condition of trigger finger, its causes, and the treatment options available. However, it does not provide a clear comparison of the benefits and risks of each treatment option, nor does it explicitly involve the patient in the decision-making process.

bF-F6pGVOyI,"Trigger finger is caused by a swollen tendon, your flexor tendon, that allows your finger to bend. Trigger finger is a form of tendonitis and it can happen from overuse or spontaneously out of the blue. Sometimes the issue will resolve spontaneously on its own. For the other cases we have several treatment options for trigger finger. Oral or topical anti-inflammatories are a good first option to treat conservatively. You can also try a nighttime splint for your finger to alleviate pain. The splint helps keep your finger straight at night while you sleep. Cortisone injections are also an option and are roughly 50% effective in treating trigger finger. Lastly, some cases of trigger finger require surgical release. Surgical release for a trigger finger is an outpatient procedure which means you can go home the same day. The surgery is performed for a small incision which typically takes about two weeks to heal. The total recovery period after surgery is three to four weeks during which time most patients experience some soreness or stiffness. After about a month you should be able to go back to your normal activities without the pain of your trigger finger.

c-fDxviyeIk,"BraceAbility is introducing a brand new solution for trigger finger and trigger thumb pain. You might have trigger finger if: Your finger feels stiff or tender, especially in the morning. Your finger pops or clicks when you move it. Or, your finger locks in a bent position and you can't straighten it. The tendons in your fingers are surrounded by sheaths, which protect them and keep them lubricated so your fingers can move. Repetitive hand motions like gripping, can damage this part of your tendon and make it inflamed or swollen. Then, it can't move through the sheath. This is trigger finger. BraceAbility's new rigid splint prevents your finger from bending into that position where it could catch or lock while still allowing the rest of your hand to move freely. The soft padding makes it comfortable to wear day or night, on any finger or your thumb, and one size fits all. With the nylon side facing up, lay your finger over the brace so the splint is directed down towards your palm. Fasten the top of the ""T"" so it rests between the base of your finger and your knuckle, where you would wear a ring. Then, tighten the Velcro strap to your desired comfort level.

V0FfMzemLnU,"- Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist. - Brad Heineck, physical therapist. - And together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion, of course, Bob. - Pay attention. Today we're gonna talk about the top three ways to treat trigger finger. Trigger finger, by the way, is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain. Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching.",4,3,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Explanation: The video has a clear aim of explaining the top three ways to treat trigger finger. However, the transcript is quite long and contains unnecessary details, such as the crude model demonstration and the discussion of other possible causes of trigger finger. The instructions for each treatment method are clear, but the transcript could be shorter and more focused."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims, as it provides some information about the causes, symptoms, and treatments of trigger finger. However, it lacks a clear structure, scientific evidence, and professional appearance. The video could be improved by providing more details on the anatomy and physiology of the condition, citing sources for the effectiveness of the treatments, and presenting the information in a more organized and engaging manner."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it provides some information about trigger finger, its causes, and some treatment options. However, it is not very detailed or scientific, and it includes some unrelated or incorrect information, such as the mention of menopause being a common cause in older women. The video also lacks proper references or sources to support its claims. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially relevant.'"," 2

Explanation: The video is partially clear about the sources of information used to compile the publication. The video mentions that trigger finger is an overuse injury and that it is common in older women who are menopausal, but it does not provide any specific references or citations for these statements.

pndnd5dgumY,"Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks. . .",4,3,4,2,4,3,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4," 4

At44YQYDFVI,"For today, I would like to talk about painful and clicking fingers. It's called trigger finger. Maybe some of you have experienced this problem. What causes trigger finger? Normally, when we flex our finger, there is a long tendon that pulls the finger and helps it smoothly slide through a protective sheath that surrounds it. In cases of trigger finger, the protective sheath can become inflamed with repeated use such as typing, texting, and other hand manipulations. When the sheath is inflamed, the tendon cannot slide smoothly, thereby causing the finger to click. It can affect any finger. It can affect the thumb. With repeated clicks, the tendon can also become inflamed, causing a nodule like a scar to form. I'll show you the picture. Okay, I'll show you the picture. So this is a picture of how our hand works. We have tendons that attach to our finger bones, and this is how we bend our fingers. In cases of trigger finger, as you can see, there is a nodule at the base of the finger, and this causes the painful clicking. What are the risk factors for having trigger finger? Persons around between 40 to 60 years old, they are more at risk. People are more commonly affected than males. Another risk factor is when you keep on using your hands. People who frequently grip and handle things like for work, hobbies are more prone to get trigger finger. Too much typing, texting, or working out with heavy dumbbells may also cause this. Those who play musical instruments for long hours are at risk. People with diabetes and arthritis are more at risk of getting trigger finger. So I'll be teaching you the treatment for trigger finger. For mild diseases, you can just rest your hand for a month. This can help improve symptoms, avoid repeated gripping, be aware that too much gripping can worsen a trigger finger, avoid using vibrating machines, try soaking your hand in warm water – this can help reduce the pain and the clicking, and you have to protect your affected finger and your affected hand. I will be showing you some simple exercises and stretches for trigger finger and also for other hand conditions. In trigger finger, there is usually a nodule at the base of the finger. If it's the thumb, it's located here, or if it's the finger, it's located here. Usually I had trigger finger several years ago, and there was this nodule at this part. It was really very painful when you bend it. One thing you can do is you can massage the nodule, as I've shown you. Try to massage it gently, clockwise, counterclockwise, for one to two minutes, maybe two times or three times a day, and try to stretch it slowly. Don't injure yourself afterwards. You can see if this works or not. If it doesn't work, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon or a hand surgeon. The doctor might do some steroid injection. Doctors may inject a steroid solution near the base of the affected finger. It's not that painful and not that expensive. This injection is more effective, this steroid injection, if you give it within one to two weeks from the onset of symptoms. So you have to consult your orthopedic surgeon early. And if this steroid injection doesn't work, there's also a surgical release of a trigger finger. Hopefully, we don't have to come into that. I will show you some simple exercises, not only for trigger finger, for carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is when you have numbness and pain and sometimes weakness of your hand. I'll show you some simple exercises. You can follow me. Try to open and close your hand 10 to 20 times. Try to stretch and loosen your fingers. After 20 times, try to open and close like this. Try to feel the stretch. I can feel the stretch. Our hands are very important, so we have to keep them in shape. Afterwards, you can try some maneuver. This maneuver is used for carpal tunnel. In carpal tunnel, you have to go into certain positions for 5 to 10 seconds. Just follow me. This is the claw position. Gently 5 to 10 seconds. Next is the half fist position. 5 to 10 seconds. This helps the tendon to glide and slide. Next you do the table top. You can do this for one hand or both hands. Then you do the close fist, completely close fist. 5 to 10 seconds. You can do this 2 to 3 times a day. 2 to 3 times a day. And there's one simple exercise. You just turn your hands around. Keep your hands higher than your heart. The swelling will be less. I'll just show you two last simple exercises. You can do this 5 to 10 times. Bend downwards 5 to 10 times to loosen your hands. Then bend upwards. You can do this 10 times, maybe at most 20 times if you want to rest your hands. Then try to turn it around. If your finger clicks, that's okay. We're trying to loosen and condition your hands. Okay, so those are my simple exercises for trigger finger for carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope this helps you. And if it doesn't work, I mean if you have trigger finger or carpal tunnel, if it worsens, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon. So thank you for watching my video. Thank you for subscribing. I'll try to do more English videos in the future. Thank you very much for watching. God bless everyone.",4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,4,4," 4

sjH6PE9-MTI,"The trigger finger is a condition that involves the tendons of the hand and the fingers. The tendons of the fingers pass through a series of pulleys, much like a fishing line passes through a series of guide wires on a fishing pole. These pulleys give us a mechanical advantage and give us a very strong grip. However, oftentimes the tendons can become inflamed and the pulleys can become thickened. This is what is referred to as a trigger finger. The symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the fingers that is often associated with a nodule or a small bump that can be felt and it can oftentimes be associated with catching or locking of the finger. In very severe cases, this does require manual assistance to obtain full extension of the fingers. Trigger finger is often caused by such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or diabetes, but oftentimes the cause is undetermined. If you suspect that you may be suffering from trigger finger, the first thing to do is begin taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve or ibuprofen. This will assist with the pain and will also decrease the inflammation around the tendon. You may also try gentle stretching at home, which would consist of locking the affected finger together and slowly stretching it out to try to stretch the tendon and prevent it from locking or triggering. If this does not work, it is advised to see your local hand surgeon, at which point you may receive a corticosteroid injection into the area of the pain at the base of the palm. A corticosteroid injection is extremely effective at decreasing the pain and oftentimes eliminating a trigger finger. If a corticosteroid injection does not work, a small surgery is recommended. For more information, please visit your local hand surgeon or visit www.orlandohandsurgery.com.",4,4,4,3,4,4,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4,2," 4

WZ3LlLCsNic,"Alan Litt is playing his guitar pain free for the first time in almost ten years. Thanks to hand surgeon Dr. Stephen Troum, a member of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. Just three months ago Dr. Troum treated Mr. Litt's trigger finger, a common but very diblitating ailment. Today the two are sharing their passion for music. The pain was excruciating. I was in pain all the time, my hand was locking, my finger was locking up all the time. I was depressed because I couldn't play and um, but the constant pain was the worst thing. It hurt all the time. So by the time I came in to see Dr. Troum I could hardly open my hand and I didn't want to. I basically kept it comfortable, in a comfortable fist like this, because that was not aggravating it at all. The pain was 24 hours a day. As soon as, it's the first thing you think of when i woke up, it was the last thing I thought of when I went to bed. So basically that's where I was before I had the surgery. Well when Mr. Litt came in, he came in with the classic complaints of trigger finger and that is his ring finger was catching on him and locking, and it was very painful. It was interfering with his work but it was also interfering with his activity as a guitar player and a musician. Initially we tried to treat it without surgery and we put him on anti-inflamatory medication, we also will try steroid injections into the sheath to try and make the swelling and inflamation go down, but that doesn't work, then the next step would be surgery. Trigger Finger is basically a tendon problem where you have inflamation in the tendons typically the flexors in your hand, is where it occurs. The inflamation causes swelling around the tendon and that swelling basically causes the tendon to snag inside the sheath giving you this locking or clicking or cathing sensation. Imagine basically like your belt, a series of belt loops and imagine tieing a knot in your belt and you might be able to pull it through the belt loop but it will pop or catch you and certainly if the knot is too big it won't even pull through. Now imagine cutting that belt loop that belt loop it's getting caught on. The belt will stay on your waist because you've got all the other belt loops holding it there but you've caught the one belt loop, cut the one belt loop that is causing the problem. The procedure starts out after we've prepped and draped the patient's hand, made a sterile field, he's asleep of course and we'll make a small incision about half an inch or so in the palm overlying that tendon sheath and in Mr. Litt's case it was of the ring finger. So it'll be an incision sort of in the palm and then we go down to the tendon sheath itself and the pulley, which is called the a1 pulley, it's the actual structure where the sheath begins, the beginning of the tunnel, as you might think. We insize that pulley and open it up and you can see the tendons underneath and you can actually move the finger and see the tendons gliding the way they should and once you've had an adequate release, opened up the sheath enough and the tendons stop clicking you're basically done at that point. You wash the wound out and close it up. The surgery was easier than getting your teeth cleaned. I mean I went in, they put me to sleep I woke up and bada-boom bada-bing and it was done. So after about three weeks, I had no clicking, my finger was not clicking any more, wasn't locking up, still hurt. It still hurt from the surgery a little bit but that was to be expected. I was warned about that, and I got to tell you it was something akin to a miracle. It was great. It was fantastic. I can move my hand again. I can move my finger again, loosely, easily. So if you're out there and you got trigger finger go see a hand surgeon. That's my experience. If you want to seek out a hand surgeon and you have a problem with your hand go to www.handcare.assh.org, it's the website of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. They have lots of patient education resources on the site as well as a directory where you can put in your city or your ZIP code and find a hand surgeon who is fellowship trained and board certified in your area. It's an irratation, It's a knot in your ligament and the only way to get help is really just to get that thing out of there and go see a hand doctor because it works.",4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion of course, Bob. Put that down! - A little hint of what we're gonna talk about there. We're gonna talk about trigger finger. - Carry on, carry on. - If you have it you probably know it generally affects the thumb or the ring finger or the ring finger or the middle finger. - Get your fingers figured out. - Ring finger, middle finger or thumb. - Okay. - Most common, very common in older women. - Okay. - As you get up into forties and sixties, it tends to happen. - So what are the symptoms of a trigger finger? - First off, if it's very stiff and tender in the mornings and you may actually, quite often, usually I see a lump right here on the palm of the hand. - Right where the palm meets the finger. Okay. - And it pops and clicks, but the the telltale sign is if it locks in place. - So when you close your hand that's when it's gonna go like a click. - It could, it could be when you close it could even, you could close it fine. And then when you open it- - It doesn't wanna open. - Yeah. It doesn't wanna open. - And then you get past that point. - Yeah. - And it usually hurts to get past that point. Is that correct? - Right. It's not a fun thing. - Okay. - So we actually have a video on that too, on different ways to treat it, but this Brace Ability and I'll put the name down here and I'll put their link down below. - Sure. - They're a place that sells braces and a lot of nice braces. - Yep. - And they sent us one of these and they say she sent us three of these and we used them on patients. - Sure. - And they really liked them. - The patients did. - The patients really liked them. - Okay. - What they like about it is that one, it's one size fits all. 'Cause normally a brace like this you have to have fitted, believe it or not. And in fact, we had a lady who had a brace that was fitted for her and she lost it. - So the custom brace. - Yep. - Okay. - It was a custom brace. And so we gave her one of these and she ends up finding the other brace while she's wearing this one. And she still prefers this one. - Over the custom one. - Yeah. Over the custom one. - Sure. - So she's still wearing this. So that's, I thought it was a good testimony to that. - Right. So what does that do, Bob? - Well, the thing is it, it stops you from bending the finger all the way. - So the first two joints can bend. - Right. - But the one closest to the palm is the one that has the problem. And that's the one that stays still. So you don't- - That's exactly right. So one of the problems with braces quite often is if they brace the whole thing you can't move it at all, which is not good. - Right. - You wanna have some movement. So it kind of gives a solution here 'cause it gives you some movement but it doesn't give you the movement that's gonna cause it to lock up. - And that's the painful part. - Right. - Unfortunately this is not gonna make your pain go away, it may make your problem go away. - Right. - It's likely still gonna be there. I know there's injections you can do. And there's surgery and a lot of people, even after all that, it can come back. - Sure. - So my only suggestion about this and we're gonna show you how to put this on in just a minute. But my only suggestion for this would be to make it like a tan color. - We're talking to the manufacturer. - Talking manufacturer, that way it wouldn't be so noticeable. - Right. - 'Cause it, it is quite- - Right. - Looks like a ring this way, but- - Sure. Kinda a weird ring though, Bob. - Yeah. I don't have it all the way. - We're gonna show him how to put it on. - Yeah, let's do that right now. We'll cut away. All right. We're gonna start off, you're gonna take the brace and you're gonna put it... You're gonna have your palm up here like this just to see where you're putting it here. And it's gonna below that knuckle right here. You're gonna put it right below the ring where- - Where the joint is. - Yeah. Where the joint is. So you're gonna put it like that, flat, and you're gonna pull up the one side, pull up the other side. It's a little clumsy. And then you're gonna go ahead and tighten it up. - Good old Velcro, huh Bob? - Velcro. It's this and there you go. And once it's on you can tighten it up a little bit more yet. And there you go. It's all ready to go. - Excellent. - So thanks a lot to BraceAbility. - You bet. Nice brace. - All right.",4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,2," 4

Second, they discuss the symptoms of trigger finger, but they do not claim to provide a comprehensive or definitive list of symptoms. They mention that there may be other symptoms that they have not covered, and they acknowledge that there are other treatments for trigger finger besides the brace they are discussing. Finally, they suggest that the brace may not make the pain go away, and they mention that there are other possible treatments that may not be effective either. These instances of uncertainty indicate that the video does not present a clear or definitive answer to the question of how to treat or diagnose trigger finger."," 2

The video does not describe how each treatment works. It only talks about one treatment, which is the use of a brace. The brace is described in detail, but no other treatments are mentioned or explained."," 2

58xQr9tOx24,"Hello, my name is Sanj Kakkar. I'm a consultant hand surgeon here at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and today we'll be talking about trigger finger. Trigger finger is a common diagnosis that we see in our hand clinic on a daily basis, where patients come in and they're experiencing pain in their hand, and sometimes the finger gets stuck. So, for example, when the finger is down, they often have pain and try to get it straightened. They often complain also of pain lower on in the finger, but the actual process that's going on is right over here, which is on the undersurface of the knuckle. And in terms of what's happening, if you look at this model here, the skin has been taken off for simplicity, but you can see these blue structures, and these are the tendons, and these are basically the rope that allow us to move our fingers back and forth. To keep the rope close to the bone, we have some natural thickenings, and these are called pulleys, and there are eight of these in the finger. However, in trigger finger, the actual process of where the problem is happening is on the undersurface of the finger, just underneath the knuckle joint. In terms of the cause of trigger finger, the majority of cases we don't know what the cause is. Sometimes it's related, for example, to inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, but the belief is that when one is gripping, there is a lot of force on the tendons overlying that pulley and underlining the knuckle, and that's what causes the inflammation. Patients complain of sometimes pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. They have difficulty in extending their fingers, and in terms of the actual diagnosis, it can be made readily in the office. Patients tend to be tender, just in this area where one's pushing, and you could actually feel it, the clicking, when they're making the fist. In terms of the treatment, a simple measure one can do is, for example, use a splint that keeps the fingers straight, especially at nighttime, and so that relieves the pain that patients have in the morning. We can also give a steroid injection, and this tends to work well, for example, in non-diabetics, in younger patients, where they've had symptoms for a short period of time, and also when the trigger finger, it tends to affect one finger, and sometimes it can affect a number of fingers. If the injection does not work or is not offered, other procedures that can be done is an office procedure, where one can place a needle just underneath the skin and release that catching pulley, or the other alternative is in the operating room. And this is done, it takes about five to ten minutes, and we need to be careful here, there are numerous nerves and blood vessels that need to be protected, and one simply removes the catching pulley system. Sutures are usually placed that come out after about two weeks' time, however, the patients are able to move their fingers straight away, and it's a relatively reproducible operation with good outcomes.",4,4,5,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

kB-V9Sj2nok,"What's the cause of the trigger finger and how can you heal it? Hi and welcome to my channel. Today we're going to talk about the trigger finger. I know a lot of people who have that exact same problem and I also have some students who have the trigger finger. In order to solve a problem you always have to know what has caused it. Well sometimes the trigger finger is something that you were born with. In that case you can't do anything about the cause because you don't know anything about it. But very often people who have diabetes have trigger finger. People who are totally stressed out often have a trigger finger. Also if you work with a computer too often and use your hand all day long. Also when you have hands, neck and shoulders. That could be another cause. There are loads of different things you could look into. One of the best things to do is to journal. So start journaling and writing down whatever your finger snaps. Yeah, the trigger finger or the snapping finger. So when does it happen? What did you do before? Were you stressed out before? Did you work on a computer all day long? Or was your neck very tense? What exactly happened before? That would help you to find a cause and in most cases if you eliminate the cause then you solve the problem. So that would be a very helpful thing for you to do. Then I will show you which exercises you could do with your fingers in order to get rid of your problem. So let's get started right away. I know people who managed to eliminate that problem within the shortest period of time. Meaning a couple of weeks or a couple of months. And that helped them to avoid doing the surgery. So surgery is not necessary if you can avoid doing it. If you can use something that can help you. Even if it takes longer. Surgery takes 3 to 5 minutes. But you never know what's going to happen afterwards. And if you really take the responsibility into your hands and start working on it and improving your life situation. Then everything will click into place. So in case it's your index finger that's been causing the problem. Then stretch your arm. Take your index finger and start pulling it back. It should feel comfortable. It shouldn't cause any pain. But you should also be able to feel the stretching. Which goes here through the finger and perhaps even through the arm. So if you can feel that then you're doing it right. If it was your middle finger do the same thing with the middle finger. So whatever finger has been causing the problem. Focus on that finger and keep stretching it. And if you like the exercise do it with all fingers because stretching is always good. It's always good for you. And in case you would like to dive deeper into stretching then definitely look into doing yoga. That is something that's really beneficial especially for musicians. I can highly recommend it. So after doing this stretching exercise make sure that your arm is straight and your hand is bent backwards. As far as it goes. Then you just go back and move your fingers a little bit. Relax them. And remember to do this many times during the day. Like two or three times during the day. Every single day. And don't stop doing it even if you notice some improvement. Keep doing this exercise for a minimum of six weeks or even one year. Because the problem could come back. I know in some cases it comes back and people get so frustrated then they go straight to surgery. And I don't think that's necessary. You can definitely avoid that. So keep doing your exercises. Keep stretching. And then you will see how you can solve a problem within the shortest period of time. And even if it takes one year it's totally worth it. Because you'll notice that you're capable of changing things and creating the life situation of your dreams. Am I right? After doing your exercises or before you can also massage your hand. You can massage your whole hand and fingers and everything. But if you don't have enough time then definitely massage here. Where the finger starts at the beginning of the finger. We want to give it a nice massage. And do that every day. Either before you do the exercises or after. It doesn't matter. Whatever feels comfortable to you. There are loads of other methods that could improve the flexibility of your fingers. One of them is acupuncture. The other one is lifestyle changes. Make sure you drink enough water. You exercise regularly. You get enough sunshine. And you eat loads and loads of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis. All of that plays into your health. And if part of your body doesn't work the way you want it to work then definitely ask yourself some important questions. Am I taking care of myself as well as I can? And you can always improve that. Now I am going to show you on my violin what you could do in order to help your fingers become very flexible and relaxed while you are playing. So first of all when you are playing on an E and A string your left arm is looking to the floor. The tip of your elbow is facing the floor. But when you are playing on the D string and on the G string your arm comes out so that you can see your elbow. And that is very important because it allows your fingers to stay on a string without having to stretch. Which would put extra stress on them. Which you don't want to have because you don't need any extra stress. Especially if you have a trigger finger. So make sure to move your arm just like a pendulum. Always moving around depending on which string you are playing. So when we are on the A string it is here facing the floor. When you are on the D string it comes out. And when you play on the G string it comes out even more. And in order to find out whether you took your arm out far enough you can check it here by plugging the string with your pinky. If your pinky can plug the string on which you are playing without having to stretch or to get stressed out about it then you are on the right path. Then you are doing the right thing. So remember this very important tip. Take your arm out when you are playing on the D and on the G string. I hope you found this video helpful. In case you didn't give us thumbs up, subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next video. Leave me your questions or comments down below. I will see you again in the next video.

Y4Se6z-qNmU,"Trigger finger is a condition in which a finger locks up or gets stuck in a flexed position. It can be difficult and painful to straighten out the finger. When it does straighten out, it snaps open or triggers. In order to understand why this occurs, it is important to understand a little bit about the anatomy of the finger. Two tendons travel up the bones of the fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus attaches to the bone at the tip of the finger, known as the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum superficialis, which sits just on top, attaches to the middle phalanx. As muscles in the forearm contract, they pull on these tendons, which in turn pull on the bones of the finger. This bends, or flexes, the finger. Without anything holding the tendons up against the bones, they would bowstring as the muscles contracted, and so there are small ligamentous structures, known as pulleys, that hold the flexor tendons in place as they travel down the bones of the fingers. Some of the pulleys have fibers that cross over one another. They are called cruciate pulleys. Some of the pulleys simply pass straight over the tendons. They are called annular pulleys. The pulleys are numbered according to their position. Triggering usually occurs at the A1 pulley, or the first annular pulley. If something irritates the flexor tendons, they may swell. This causes rubbing and friction against the pulley each time the finger bends and extends. The irritation worsens and the tendons thicken. Over time, the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. Once the finger has been flexed, the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck. With effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open.",4,4,4,4,5,5,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,4,4," 4

-gt7a3e2cVU,"Hey, it's Jess from Head to Toe Health. We're going to do a flossing exercise for the pudendal nerve today. So you can do this on a sink, like a bathroom sink is quite handy unless you've got something really good like this to hold onto as well. So about the size of a sink or a bench. So placing the feet shoulder width apart, quite close to where you're gripping. And as you come back, you're going to just drop back as if you're dropping back into a seat and you're going to bring the head back. Keep the arms straight as you come up nice and slow, just gliding nice and slow. You're going to come up onto the toes, drop the head and pause there. Then as you come down again, letting the head drop back and sitting back into that seat. Bring up onto the toes, drop the head, keeping the arms straight the whole time. So you've got to be on something that you're confident to hold your weight on. And you can work up to doing 10 of those and do them twice a day.",3,3,2,1,4,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1," 3

w8hXvyWGupo,"If you're someone dealing with pudendal neuralgia, there are certain things that may be happening in your day-to-day routine that could actually be exacerbating your symptoms and you may not know it because it may not hurt at the time, it may show up a few hours later or even a day or two later. In today's video, we're going to discuss these activities and things that you can do at home to provide a happy environment for your nerves so you can continue to get better. One of the biggest contributing factors to pudendal neuralgia symptoms are static postures. What we define as static posture is if somebody is staying in the same position for longer than 15 minutes. We know that a lot of people with pudendal neuralgia get exacerbated symptoms with sitting. However, you can also be compromising yourself unintentionally when you stand in the same exact position for just a little bit too long. Ways to get around this would be to stand on something such as a piece of gardening foam that's going to provide a slightly unstable surface so you're shifting and moving moment to moment, avoiding standing in the same position, for example, at your standing desk for a little bit too long. You can also vary your sitting positions between a chair, between a certain type of cushion, between a physiotherapy ball. All of these variations will use different muscles which will allow other muscles to take a break as soon as you change into the next position. Keep in mind the general rule of thumb is roughly 15 minutes. If you're stuck in your car for 20 to 30 minutes, you can also shift from side to side. You can rotate the position of your pelvis forward and backwards just to provide some variance to which would otherwise be a static and possibly problematic posture. When people wear even the slightest heel, this actually dramatically changes the position of our pelvis. It tips our pelvis into an anterior position which lengthens the pudendal nerve and increases your pelvic floor tone. Both the lengthening of the pudendal nerve and the increase in pelvic floor tone can exacerbate the symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend wearing supportive sneakers all the time. Bare feet can also compromise the position of the pelvis in a similar way that heels can and therefore supportive sneakers are really the best choice. In our bodies, everything is connected. Therefore our ankle, knee and hip positions can also affect the pelvic floor and symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. People with pudendal neuralgia notice that they have trouble walking up hills. This happens for two different reasons. Number one, there's increasing amounts of hip flexion as you advance a leg up a hill which can tension the pudendal nerve. If your nerve can't slide, glide and move properly, this extra tension can provoke a symptom. Also when we are walking uphill, we have an increase in our pelvic floor muscle tone which can compress the nerve and cause a little bit of symptom in that manner as well. A tip to get around this because sometimes we can't avoid the hills are to actually turn around and walk backwards. This is going to shorten the pudendal nerve as well as activate the posterior muscles which actually allow your pelvic floor muscles to relax. Many people with pudendal neuralgia have noticed that core exercises increase their symptoms. It's helpful to understand why. When we do activities that raise our intra-abdominal pressure or activate our core, our pelvic floor muscles reflexively contract to support our bodies. If somebody has a pudendal nerve that's irritated, this contraction of the pelvic floor is going to further compress the nerve and cause a little bit of irritation that may show up in a delayed response. Therefore, we recommend working with your physical therapist to discover what time and place is actually appropriate for you to reintroduce these types of activities and that typically is after the nerve is less reactive to touch. Easily, this is identified in a physical therapy session. Lifting heavy objects will result in pelvic floor contractions to help stabilize our bodies which in turn can also exacerbate symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend finding ways to avoid lifting heavy objects. However, if you can't, we suggest doing diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic floor drops after lifting the heavy object assuming that that did make your pelvic floor muscles tighter for the moment. Doing diaphragmatic breathing or pelvic floor drops can help the muscles return to normal tone if you can't avoid lifting the heavy object. Pudendal neuralgia is a mechanical condition in which the nerve needs to be able to slide, glide, and move. In cases of symptoms, the nerve can't do that for some reason and it can happen at multiple points along its course through the pelvis. One of the key muscles that compresses the pudendal nerve is called the obturator internus. This is an external rotator of the hip. It tends to get tight and if that muscle is tight, it's going to impair our ability to either bend forward or raise our knees up to our hips. People will often notice that this does immediately cause maybe a shooting, stabbing pain in the territory of the nerve. Once we lengthen that muscle and get it to stop compressing the nerve, people can bend forward, they can bend over, and they can bring their knees up to their chest without a problem. But in order to do that, we need to restore the normal mechanics. If you notice that you're having trouble bending over or squatting down, there's a few little tips and strategies that you can do to make it a little more comfortable. When you have both feet planted on the ground, it's going to be more provocative for your pelvis and for the pudendal nerve. We suggest trying to slightly separate your legs or bend over using just one leg at a time. You can use assistive devices such as a grabber or your physical therapist can show you techniques specific to you to help avoid provoking your nerve. One thing people with pudendal neuralgia may not think about is their fluid intake. A symptom of pudendal neuralgia can include urinary urgency and frequency, which results in our desire to go to the bathroom when our bladders are not actually full. This is problematic for many reasons, but one of which is because it starts to retrain our body to send signals that we need to urinate at less than normal volumes. By adequately drinking 64 ounces of water a day, we will have a full bladder when we go to use the bathroom. This will help keep our normal reflexes in check as well as elicit a proper pelvic floor relaxation that cannot occur at lower bladder volumes. Speaking of our bowel and bladder habits, a squatty potty is a very effective tool for people with pudendal neuralgia. The squatty potty helps improve our pelvic floor alignment that allows any type of voiding behavior to be a little bit easier and we do recommend that for patients with pudendal neuralgia as well. Something that isn't talked about enough is how much emotional stress and rising cortisol levels actually can affect the pudendal nerve. It is the only nerve in the body that has sympathetic, sensory, and motor fibers, which means that this nerve is going to be more sensitive to emotional stress, but also provides an opportunity to help calm the irritation by strategies such as diaphragmatic breathing and meditation. We understand that most people cannot meditate at the times they may be feeling emotional stress, but actually taking a pause and doing five to six deep diaphragmatic breaths is known to help lower cortisol levels and thereby help restore a calmer environment for your nerve to function normally. Here at PHRC, pudendal neuralgia is one of our top specialties. If you feel like you are struggling with these symptoms and would like some individualized attention, please give us a call. We're available via digital health and in any one of our nine clinics for inpatient appointments. We also have out of town programs for people who are struggling who can come to see us for a week or two at a time.",5,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,4,4," 5

fCqJ8XfcfVM,"Hi, my name is Dr. Ross Hauser. Welcome to Caring Medical Florida in Fort Myers, Florida. A common condition that we see is pelvic floor dysfunction, which causes, which can cause pudendal neuralgia or compression of the pudendal nerve. The most common treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction is actually different types of physical therapy. And often that is helpful, but very seldom do I find that it cures people. If somebody has really severe pudendal nerve pain, sometimes they actually even have surgical decompression. So the surgeon is trying to release the nerve surgically in the various parts of its path that can cause compression. What most people don't realize is that the pudendal nerve, the reason that the pudendal nerve gets stretched, gets compressed, gets irritated is because of pelvic instability. So I just want to explain how pelvic instability causes pudendal neuralgia and also pelvic floor dysfunction. So this is basically the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor is in between the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joints here. It's right here, the perineum. If you see here, this is actually the sciatic nerve. This is actually the sciatic nerve. So we all know the sciatic nerve goes in the back of the leg down to the foot, but most people don't realize these nerves, as you look in here, this is from the L5, S1, S2, S3 nerves. These nerves come out the sacrum. So the sacral nerves, the S1, the S2, the S3, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So I just want to show that. Okay, so you see like this is the sacrum. So this is the sacrum. See how the sacral nerves, the sacral nerves here, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So the most common reason the sacral nerves would get irritated is because the sacrum is moving too much. So some of these nerves come out the back, but then some of the nerves, some of the nerves, they're going to come out the front and then they're going to go into the perineum. One of those nerves is the pudendal nerve. You know, the nerves are coming out the front here. So some of these, the lower sacral nerves, the lower sacral nerves, they're going to form the pudendal nerve. That's what you see here. See how there it's going out of the sacrum and then it forms the pudendal nerve. So the question is what would cause the sacrum to rotate the sublux, to have too much movement where it actually is going to irritate these sacral nerves. Well the most common reason is going to be either sacroiliac ligament laxity or pubic symphysis laxity. Now sacroiliac laxity, in other words, the sacrum and the iliac crust, they move too much. So say a person had right pudendal neuralgia and what that would cause is unbelievable pain in the perineum and it often can be on one side. So terrible pain in the perineum. Well the pudendal nerve, the pudendal nerve, it goes between the sacrotuberous ligament and the sacrospinal ligament. Right here the pudendal nerve, to get into the pelvic inlet here, it goes between these two ligaments. So if somebody has laxity on one side, ligament laxity on one side, that would mean that there's going to be extra bony movement of this anomone bone on that side and the pudendal nerve can get entrapped between the sacrotuberous and the sacrospinous ligament. So the treatment then would be proper alignment of the anomone bone and also stabilization of the pelvic instability with prolotherapy.",4,3,4,2,4,3,2,4,4,3,3,3,4,4,3," 4

J4ObY48wdhU,"Hi there, I'm Dr. Britta Allgeier. I'm going to talk to you about the Pelvic Wand. This is a pelvic wand by Intimate Rose. I'm going to just give you a brief overview on how to use it. It is a little intimidating when you first see it, but it is a great, great, I can't say enough wonderful things about this. Once you get comfortable using it, you'll really love it. There obviously are two ends. Typically this is the end that we use rectally, and this is the end that we use vaginally. You can use whichever one you wish. I usually recommend starting with this end just because it's smaller. It's similar to the size of your finger. This one is great once you get comfortable using it because you can get to deeper muscles in your pelvic floor. It's got this nice curve so that you can angle it around. Whereas if you're trying to do that with your finger, it gets very hard to reach into those deeper muscles. For vaginally, we will start more with a superficial. This looks like a triangle. A lot of times you will work on these muscles when you're having pain with insertion, pain with intercourse, bladder pain. Believe it or not, there's a little muscle right underneath the labia that can spasm and it can feel just like a bladder infection. If you want to help alleviate that without taking medicine, if you do have a bladder infection, obviously you need to get that treated. When you go to the doctor and they tell you, you don't have a bladder infection, you're like, well, why does it feel like it? Well, because this muscle right here is spasming. Also, there's an area right here. We typically refer to it as a pelvic clock. This is 12, this is 6. This area is a great area to focus on as well when you're pregnant just because you want to lengthen the vaginal opening so that you don't have tearing right here. You can use this wand or your finger. You start by putting lubrication on it. We use slippery stuff, but you can use whichever you want. We recommend not using anything glycerin based or with any kind of added sugar ingredients because that can lead to infection, which we don't want. You put a little lubrication on here and then you'll just slowly go in. I like to start more at the bottom and work my way up, but you can start whichever way that is comfortable for you. You'll just go in and just gently pull. It's just like a pulling, lifting sensation. It shouldn't hurt. If you feel like a stingy burning sensation, just back off from the pressure. You just move along and it should just feel like a pulling sensation, a little bit of a stretching. You go around and then go to the other side. 10-15 seconds in each spot and deep breathing while you go on. Just inhale and exhale. Go through three breath cycles and then move your way around. This is more the superficial layer. To get to the deeper layer, these guys right in the bowl of your pelvis, you go in vaginally and then you'll go right over to these. If you have pain with deep penetration or near the hip muscles, going in deeper will help target those muscles. If you go in at 6 o'clock, you're going to hit more of these organs. This is your bladder. That's more at 12 o'clock. This is the vaginal opening. That's what you're going through. This is your rectum. If you feel a little pressure down here, you're hitting your rectum. You're not going to hurt anything, but it may feel like you have to go to the bathroom. If you come up at the 12 o'clock area, you'll hit your bladder. Again, it will just feel like you have to pee. Just go over to the side. The last part is using the Intimate Rose Wand rectally. The best position is on your side. You'll put the lubrication on. This is your tailbone. You're going to be angling right off to the side, both angles. This little muscle right here, this is your coccygeus. It's a little troublemaker. If you just gently go into that, you'll feel pressure. It's typically tight. Just hang out there. You just go in slowly. You're pulling and lifting. Again, if you have discomfort or it's painful, just back off on the pressure. Deep breathe. You just move around every 10-15 seconds. If there's a target area that feels really tight, just hang out there and do some deep breathing. Then you'll go to the other side as well. I hope that helps. I recommend starting with a pelvic floor therapist just to figure out what it's going to feel like. We can go over how to use this in our office and guide you through it. Also, make sure that you're using it correctly. I hope that helps and takes away the anxiety of using this. It's a wonderful tool and it can really help alleviate pain.",4,4,2,2,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2," 4

If found him in a long journey trying to find doctors who could help my issue that was started in 2013 with the diagnosis of prostate cancer diagnosis started in 2013 when I went to the doctor for a physical. normal yearly physical and when they blood work came back my talk to you phone me that my PSA where above normal. I've never had any issues regarding anything and she explained to me that the essay was a test on the prostate to determine if there was something wrong with it no one day did the biopsies came back positive so we decided to go with the seeds the seeds in the stage work you can go about your business and they slowly kill the cancer or a two and a half months. The day of the procedure came and went in and I was told the only place that I would hurt was when the procedure was supposed to go where they put the needles in but when I woke up and there's something drastically if I'm wrong so I went home for the weekend pain was unforgivable it was like somebody had set a burning Amber into my pelvic area so Monday we made an appointment to go back to the doctor Tuesday they did a re scan and it showed that six seeds were floating around my bladder basically burning everything it touched we also found five seeds that were in the Pudendal Nerve area Wednesday when they went back in to take the seeds that were in my bladder out but they did not take the seeds that were In my Pudendal Nerve they thought they would do more damage by taking them out then just leaving them in. Our next stop was a hospital in Tampa Florida Pain management doctors there relayed that there was a procedure called radio frequency ablation. It lasted about nine months. Unfortunately the procedure also causes damage because of scar tissue so that procedure Worked which was great I mean- you know - it did great and after nine months the pain came back. So from that point on the pain started skyrocketing my girlfriend Kathy found Dr. Elkwood and we called him and sent him all of the information. He looked it over I am going to tell you right now it wasn't easy he made you jump through hoops to make sure this is exactly one that you want to do He made me do a lot of tests and wanted to make sure exactly what was going on which I was gladly to do and flying see Dr. Elkwood, I’m live in Florida and he's a New Jersey. It was a- it was painful - very very painful. But we did it cause he he seemed to us this lie that he was serious about it and he said thought he could do something about it we met with them a couple times and it decided to do the procedure we went ahead in micro surgically released the pudendal nerve and surrounding nerves in that area in the just outside the area of the prostate the area that had been radiated as well Even in the medical community very few know that are very good treatment options for Pudendal Neuralgia. Dr. Elkwood when he went in he took out all of the radiation damage, all of the damage that was called by the radio frequency ablations. Uh and got the nerves to fire correctly. So as I like to tell Robert, he’s in the “W” column. He’s in the win column, and he really did exceptionally well.

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The video seems to be about Robert's journey with prostate cancer and the various treatments he underwent, ultimately leading to a successful procedure by Dr. Elkwood. However, the video lacks a clear introduction and conclusion, making it difficult to understand the main purpose of the video."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript is a personal testimony of a patient who had prostate cancer and underwent multiple treatments, including seeds, radiofrequency ablation, and eventually a surgery by Dr. Elkwood. The video aims to showcase the effectiveness of Dr. Elkwood's procedure in treating the patient's Pudendal Neuralgia, a complication of the previous treatments. The video partially achieves its aim, as it provides a detailed account of the patient's journey and the outcome of the surgery. However, it lacks some important information, such as the duration of the pain relief, the potential risks and complications of the surgery, and the long-term outcomes. Therefore, the score is 4, meaning 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video is relevant to the topic of prostate cancer and its treatment, as it shares the personal experience of a patient who underwent multiple procedures to manage his pain.

Additionally, the transcript contains some informal language and colloquialisms, which may make it less clear for some readers. Overall, the transcript is partially clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced."," 3

Explanation: The video is partially balanced and unbiased. The speaker shares his personal experience with Dr. Elkwood and the treatment he received for his prostate cancer and Pudendal Neuralgia. He mentions the positive outcome of the treatment and how it changed his life. However, the video does not provide any information about alternative treatments or other doctors' opinions, which could have given a more balanced view of the situation. Additionally, the speaker's tone is positive and enthusiastic, which may indicate some bias towards Dr. Elkwood."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details about the sources of support and information, such as the names of doctors (Dr. Elkwood, pain management doctors in Tampa Florida) and the procedures they performed (seeds, radio frequency ablation, micro surgical release of the pudendal nerve). However, it does not provide any additional sources of support or information, such as websites, organizations, or books that could help people who are facing similar issues. Therefore, the score is 3, which means 'partially.'"," 4

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty in several aspects. First, the patient describes the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer and the use of PSA tests, which are not perfect and can have false positives or negatives. Second, the patient discusses the complications from the first procedure, where seeds were placed in his prostate but some migrated to other areas, causing pain and requiring further intervention. Third, the patient mentions the pain management doctors in Tampa who suggested another procedure, radio frequency ablation, which worked for a while but eventually caused more pain. Finally, the patient talks about finding Dr. Elkwood, who offered a different solution that ultimately helped, but the patient had to go through a lot of tests and hoops to ensure he was a good candidate. These uncertainties are not insurmountable, but they do create some doubt and hesitation in the patient's journey."," 4

Explanation: The video describes two treatments: seed implantation and radiofrequency ablation. However, it does not provide a clear explanation of how each treatment works. The seed implantation treatment is briefly mentioned, but the video focuses more on the pain and complications that arose from the procedure. The radiofrequency ablation treatment is also briefly mentioned, but the video does not explain the science behind the procedure or how it works to treat prostate cancer.

Explanation: The video does not provide a clear description of the risks of each treatment. It only briefly mentions the pain and complications that the patient experienced with the first two treatments (seeds and radiofrequency ablation). The third treatment (micro surgical release of the pudendal nerve) is presented as a successful solution without discussing its potential risks. Therefore, the score is 2, meaning 'partially.'"," 2

Explanation: The video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used. It only describes the experiences of Robert Williams, who had prostate cancer and underwent multiple treatments to manage his pain. The video does not provide any information about the natural course of the disease or the consequences of not receiving any treatment."," 4

The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The speaker shares his experience with different treatments for prostate cancer, including seeds implantation and radiofrequency ablation, and how they affected his pain levels and overall well-being. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the different treatment options or their long-term effects on quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The patient describes his journey with prostate cancer and the different treatments he tried, such as seed implants and radiofrequency ablation. He eventually found Dr. Elkwood, who performed a different procedure to address his Pudendal Neuralgia. The video shows that there are multiple treatment options available for prostate cancer and its related complications."," 4
Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, as the patient, Robert, shares his experience with different treatments for prostate cancer and the pain management issues that followed. He discusses his journey with Dr. Elkwood, who made him undergo several tests to ensure that the procedure he was suggesting would be suitable for Robert's condition. However, the video does not provide a clear comparison of the different treatment options or the rationale behind choosing Dr. Elkwood's procedure. It mainly focuses on the patient's personal experience and the positive outcome of the procedure. Therefore, the score is 4, which means 'partially' in terms of supporting shared decision-making.",set(),247
ykWPPGNuHZk,"If you are having pain in your clitoris, penis, scrotum, labia, perineum, or anus- especially when sitting, your doctors have ruled out infections, & they're not sure what's wrong with you you might have Pudendal Neuralgia. In this video we are going to talk about what Pudendal Neuralgia is, how people get it, and why physical therapy is such an important part of someone's treatment plan to help recover from this syndrome. If you suspect you have Pudendal Neuralgia, one of the questions you need to ask is- Is it on one side of my body or both? We have a pudendal nerve on the right, we have a pudendal nerve on the left. And commonly when it starts to get activated & turns into a neuralgia, it's going to affect one side more than the other. It's important to differentiate neuralgia symptoms from muscle aches and pains. And so typically, neuralgias (whether it's pudendal or elsewhere) have sharp, shooting, stabbing pain versus ""I feel a little achy, I feel a little sore."" That's different. We're really looking along the path of the nerve to see that it's neuropathic in nature. And by neuropathic, we mean: burning, throbbing, aching, stabbing. The Pudendal Nerve is unique because it is one of the only peripheral nerves in the body that has sensory fibers, motor fibers, and autonomic. Which means automatic fibers too, in addition to the pain that accompanies Pudendal Nerve the pudendal nerve is involved in a number of reflexes that are tied to orgasm, bowel movements, and urinary function. So people may also experience urinary urgency, frequency, burning with urination ,painful ejaculation, inability to orgasm, or difficulty with bowel movements & pain associated with bowel movements. There's a wide range of reasons why people develop Pudendal Nerve, and for some people it can be one of the things I'm about to mention or a combination of a few. So if we're looking at some of the general categories, we can start with compression. This means the people who are cyclists, who ride horses, or who sit for long periods of time during the day. Going in the opposite direction, there can also be tension injuries. So this is more commonly associated with things like: long second stages of labor, or chronic constipation, or certain types of exercise that involve deep & excessive ranges of motion with the hip & lumbar spine. The next category can be associated with surgical trauma. So for various pelvic floor conditions, whether it's prostatectomy or pelvic floor reconstruction for different types of prolapse, there can be a surgical insult somewhere along the path of the pudendal nerve. And finally there can be traumatic issues that affect the pudendal nerves; such as car accidents or falling on top of various items in your lawn or in the yard that can basically cause an injury in or around the congenital nerve space. Because there's so many different reasons why somebody has pudendal neuralgia, it's really important to get down to their anatomy and physiology to figure out what is causing their symptoms. So regardless of the mechanism of how it developed, the next phase is to figure out- is there muscle dysfunction, is there tissue dysfunction, what is happening along the course of someone's pudendal nerve that does not allow the nerve to move, glide, and slide the way it should, therefore resulting in symptoms. So unfortunately the people you think to go to when you have symptoms of pudendal neuralgia (a gynecologist, a urologist, potentially a neurologist) are really not the people equipped to evaluate why someone has pudendal neuralgia. Which really leads into the expertise of a pelvic floor physical therapist and physical therapists who can identify various muscles tissues and reasons why the nerve is compromised. So physical therapy is so important for pudendal neuralgia because what will happen during evaluation with a physical therapist compared to a swab or a culture or something that happens on the medical side, is the physical therapist is going to do a history to help identify potential mechanisms as to why their nerve got irritated. But then also do a very specific physical exam that is going to look at movement patterns, muscle tone in the pelvic floor, and the pelvic girdle muscles, trigger points, tissue issues, and reasons that are going to compromise the nerve anywhere along its course. Which runs basically from the sacrum through the pelvic floor to all the different areas we mentioned initially (the clitoris, the penis, the scrotum, the labia, the perineum and the anus). There are various places along the course of the nerve that can get compromised. Certain people may have compromise along the entire track of the nerve. Certain people may only have compromise in one little spot. The physical exam and the movement exam that physical therapists can do will help identify each individual person's causes for why they're having the symptoms that they're having.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4," 4

Pudendal neuralgia is a commonly, I mean if you know about the term, chances are you probably have that. The reason I'm doing this video is because I wish people would catch it before it becomes a full blown issue. What is happening here with pudendal neuralgia is you have the nerves coming from the lower part of your sacrum area. And then it goes through into the inside and it goes through these different landmarks within your pelvis, the ilium part of your pelvis. And then it goes, it branches off. So you've got the pudendal nerve which is an offshoot of the sacral nerve and then it branches into three sections. One goes to the penis and vulva, the other one goes into your anal area and the third one goes to the space in between. So you can have entrapment, you can have irritation and inflammation of this nerve from the site of origin which is the lower part of your spine and sacrum all the way to those three areas that I mentioned. The issue with pudendal neuralgia is by the time they diagnose it, there's been too much time that has been spent. That's been pretty much wasted. And then there are these blocks, it has to respond positively when the nerve is blocked and then they can say, okay this is pudendal neuralgia. Go see a pelvic floor therapist for it. It's hard to reach certain parts depending on where the irritation is. And many times you're basically, it's like okay you've got to live with it. So when is a good time to catch it? Is if you have chronic lower back pelvic pain. When I say pelvic pain, I'm not talking about pain in your penis or vagina. I'm talking about pain in the pelvic area, in the pelvis, in the SI joint. If you have chronic hip issues, those are great reasons why the pelvis itself loses its balance and stability. So all structures, not just any soft tissue like a nerve, but all structures become compromised. So if it happens to be your pudendal nerve or a branch of the nerves exiting your spine or your sacral area, then that will be the issue. Pudendal neuralgia should not be a life sentence. But it's very easy to get distracted in the course of the treatment and a lot of time goes by. And by the time the final conclusion is made, it may be a little too late. So you kind of have that lingering pain or pain for the rest of your life. So it's very important to catch yourself. Don't disregard pain in your sacroiliac joint, in the lumbar area, lower back area, in your hips. Don't disregard them. Don't look at them like, oh, that's not related to this thing. People should look into these things more carefully. And the most important part is to make sure you see the right person for treatment. A lot of times when you go to see a medical doctor, they write off those areas like lower back, SI, and hip problems as an orthopedic problem. So go get some physical therapy or go see a chiropractor. Well, that's not enough because if the examination is not very much specific to rule out pudendal nerve subtle symptoms, then it's very easy to miss it and then it becomes a huge problem. I hope this video is making you realize how important it is to see the right type of provider and do not disregard subtle symptoms as if they have no value. Sorry about that. If you have any questions, make sure you use one of the methods of contact in the description box. Contact my office. Let's talk and see what's going on. Hope this helps. Take care.",4,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,3,4,4," 4

6axdhKqkoIg,"Pudendal neuralgia. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that both men and ladies can get. It's caused by an irritation or an over-activation of the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the nerves that comes off the nerve roots at the base of the spine. It's formed from the branches of L2, 3 and 4 and comes off part of the sciatic nerve. The pudendal nerve is quite unusual because it carries both sensory and motor fibres. That means it tells the muscles that it innovates what to do and also it carries sensations, so pain, touch, temperature and so on. It's got some autonomic function as well. Autonomic means the automatic processes that our bodies are involved with. That can be things like bowel function, it can be involved a little bit with bladder control, it can also be involved with sexual function such as orgasms or erections. People who struggle with pudendal neuralgia usually have pain associated with an irritation of the areas that the pudendal nerve supplies the sensation to. That's generally your pelvic floor which is what I would consider the underhand saddle area of your bottom and your genitalia. You can also have some shooting pains occasionally and going down your legs. If this nerve becomes irritated or over-activated you can experience quite severe neuropathic pain, sharp shooting, burning pain. Because you have two pudendal nerves, one on the left and one on the right, often the pain can be more predominantly on one side than the other. But it's not uncommon to have pain on both sides, particularly if the process that's resulting in that occurs in both. Nobody knows exactly why people get pudendal neuralgia but sometimes it can be caused by stretching of the pudendal nerve, particularly in cyclists who adopt a position where the pudendal nerve can be stretched. It can also be caused by sitting down for very long periods of time and we all know that as a society in general now we tend to sit a lot more than we ever did before. It can be caused by trauma, particularly during things like childbirth or labour if there's a long second stage. Or it can be caused by just a very, very tight pelvic floor. So that's the muscles that supply and hold the internal organs down through the bottom of your genitalia and things like that. There's also some suggestions that irritation or activation of your pudendal nerve can be caused by hormones such as going through menopause or even indeed endometriosis. So pudendal neuralgia is really quite a debilitating condition because you can have sharp shooting burning pain at any time, can be unprovoked and is made worse by sitting down. Quite often the pain is relieved by standing up or lying down and sleeping and things. But it's not always relieved by that and quite often sleep at night can be really quite disturbed with it, which is often the case with a lot of chronic pain conditions. Because the pudendal nerve supplies the muscles of the pelvic floor, so that's the muscles underneath that hold your internal organs up and in, if the pudendal nerve gets irritated or activated that causes these muscles to get really, really tight. And we all know that when you get tight muscles, if you get tight in your shoulders, the tighter they become, the more the pain evolves, the worse the pain becomes. And these muscles then squeeze really tight and because the pudendal nerve comes out as three branches and it forms an almost finger-like projection through these muscles, the tighter these muscles squeeze together, if the nerve is going through it, these nerve branches of the pudendal nerve then get squeezed and tightened even further. And so you can quite easily fall into this vicious, vicious circle where you've got pain, the muscles get tighter because of the pain that's there and that squeezes the nerves even more, which causes more pain and more tightening of the muscles. So it's one of these conditions, if we want to try and treat it, we need to try and break it down and we need to look at medication and predominantly anti-lerve pain medication, so the anti-lerve painkillers. We need to look at those to try and relieve the irritability and the wound up nature of the nerve pain. We also want to look at some physiotherapy, particularly looking at the pelvic floor, trying to relax the muscles of the pelvic floor and then potentially looking at any other therapies that can reduce the over-activation of the nervous system, whether that's psychological therapies or just simple relaxation exercises. And often the condition can be brought back to a much, much more manageable state. Very occasionally we can do injections, particularly if it's really, really severe, to try and just relax the muscles and to reduce the irritability of the nerve.",4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4," 4

f1uroxfbRs4,"So, pudendal neuralgia is this neuropathic pain condition that affects the pudendal nerve. So what happens is that patients who have this condition will have a lot of pain in their rectum, perineum, vagina or clitoris or menopenis and scrotum. It's a very severe neuropathic type of pain so it affects our quality of life. It causes a lot of suffering. Most patients get this from some sort of accident or trauma so either a fall, a surgery or something that can have a direct impact or injury to the pelvis. So there are some patients who cannot sit or they cannot stand because of it and those are usually the most severe presentation of this. And the next steps would be is finding out if there's something that is kind of reversible or maybe what the cause was of the pudendal neuralgia and sometimes we treat the cause and things may get better. If everything has looked so far looked fine, there's no underlying cause, this may be someone where surgical decompression of the pudendal nerve may help them. I think the best way of early diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is knowing about it. I think that as the word goes out and physicians start recognizing the symptoms, it tends to be a very easy diagnosis. So this should be considered in anybody who is having pain when they sit and who feels better when they're standing. And if their sole complaint is I'm having this pain, the pain is in my genital areas and I can't sit, I think that is, you should start thinking about pudendal neuralgia. Knowing that this type of condition truly does affect their quality of life and that we should all be very, you know, be open and listen to our patients and work with them to improve their quality of life.",4,4,5,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4," 4

oCxK0at4NFc,"If you're suffering from pain in the pelvic or genital area, and have seen numerous specialists but despite that no cause can be found, then this video on Pudendal Neuralgia might provide you with some useful information. The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them. Thank you once again.",5,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,4,4," 5

CpOzLBcxntA,"Hi there, it's Kathy Cates and Melissa Hines from the Institute for Pelvic Health. And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

o3JY6D6qbtU,"I'm Dr. Andrew Elkwood. I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

Sterile gloves, mucus, povidone iodine or stanchaxidine, 10 cc controlled syringe, Iova Trampet, 20 gauge 15 cm spinal needle, regular spinal needle for transpirinal approach, 1% local anesthetic. Prior to doing pudendal nerve block you would like to be sure that the spinal needle is appropriate length. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet. Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers. After placing lots of mucus, fingers are gently placed into vagina. After we identify ischial spine, trumpet needle is introduced. Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected. Following injection spinal needle is slowly withdrawn leaving Iova Trampet in place and then Iova Trampet is removed slowly. I just injected 10cc of ampersand xylocaine to patient's right side. Now we are going to switch the side. Iova Trampet is placed in surgeon's left hand. Iova Trampet is introduced in vagina. Left ischial spine is found.

uFWk7ztMfj8,"This video will explain what to expect when you are getting your nerve block. Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days.",5,4,5,4,5,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,2,4,4," 5

HCjtaJFgv6E,"Pudendal neuralgia and pudendal nerve block. Pudendal neuralgia is an important cause of chronic pelvic pain in both men and women and results from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve. Pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves in the pelvis and originates from the sacral nerve roots. In the gluteal region, it runs between ligaments and close to the sciatic nerve before entering the Alcox canal. Pudendal nerve entrapment results from compression of the nerve during its course through the ligaments or the Alcox canal. Symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment include pain in buttocks and genital areas, pain in the back passage and lower abdominal pain. Pain is typically aggravated by sitting and relieved by standing upright. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, rehabilitative approach including pelvic floor exercises and injections. Dr Krishna is highly experienced in performing pudendal nerve blocks. The injection is performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. Dr Krishna will initially numb the skin with a numbing medicine. He will then use an ultrasound machine to guide the needle accurately close to the pudendal nerve. Dr Krishna will eventually inject a mixture of local anaesthetic and steroid around the pudendal nerve. Pain relief from pudendal nerve injection can last several months, though this may not always be the case. Please contact Dr Krishna and his team if you have any further queries or visit our website on www.painspa.co.uk",4,4,4,3,4,4,2,2,4,4,3,2,4,4,3," 4

IpY79hQKlEk,"Good morning everybody, I am George Mjes from the St. Joseph University in Beirut, Lebanon. Today I am going to be presenting about laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release or pudendal entrapment syndrome. I have no conflict of interest. Pudendal nerves can be entrapped at different anatomical sites along with the pudendal artery. The two main entrapment locations remain between the sacrospinus and the sacrotuberous ligaments and the alcocanal. Pudendal nerve and artery entrapment is an underdiagnosed condition in clinical practice that causes mainly perineal pain and sexual dysfunction, but also urinary and rectal symptoms. Historically, and after failure of the conservative management, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes and this is why the non-criteria which were put to standardize the diagnosis were very selective in order to minimize overtreatment by such an invasive approach. This was until the advent of laparoscopic pudendal release which allowed a minimally invasive surgery with an easy access and gentle blood-free dissection. This has therefore led to widening of surgical indications. The aim of our study was to assess the safety, feasibility and functional outcomes of laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome with both a short and long-term follow-up. 235 patients with pudendal nerve entrapment were included in the study and they underwent laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release. Post-operative complications, according to the Clavian-Dendou classification, were recorded both on a short and long-term follow-up. Those are briefly the surgery steps. First, we developed the octorator space and we carried the dissection medially to the octorator vein. The coccygeous muscle fibers must be cut and released to have access to the ischial spine on which the surgeon's forceps pointing in Figure C. Finally, we arrived to the entry to the alcocanal. Here, we can clearly see the pudendal vein and artery entering the alcocanal. The pudendal nerve is lateral to the artery and not visible in the image. The goal of the surgery is to liberate the pudendal elements from the ischiatic spine to the alcocanal and transpose them medially. After assessing the post-operative outcomes in the total cohort, a prospective cohort of 32 patients was evaluated for functional outcomes before and at least 24 months after surgery. The main outcomes that were assessed are pernioidemia using visual analog scale, urinary symptoms using the urinary symptom profile, erectile function using the IIEF5, and bowel function using the patient assessment of constipation symptoms PAC-SYM score. The mean operative time per side was 33 minutes and the hospital length of stay was 2 days for the majority of patients. No significant blood loss and no serious clavian-dindo 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. Prenile or perineal paresthesia or hyperaesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint. However, it was transitory for 3 months after which all patients were free of symptoms. As for functional outcomes, perineal pain decreased significantly from a mean of VAS of 7 to a mean of 2. Erectile function improved significantly after surgery and we think it is most probably due to the artery entrapment since immediate results were seen after surgery. Constipation also decreased significantly after surgery. As for the urinary symptoms, improvement was only noted for the dysuria domain. No significant differences were found between before and after surgery or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms. So to conclude, laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release is both a fast and safe surgery with promising functional outcomes on pudendal neuralgia, erectile function, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation.

JRTcY3bN6c8,"I’m Dr. Andrew Elkwood, I am a plastic and reconstructive surgeon I specialize in in microsurgery of nerves and particularly in nerves of the pelvis so syndromes like a pudendal neuralgia, pelvic nerve entrapment and piriformis syndrome. Unfortunately not too many people either in the medical community or public at large really have a full grasp of pudendal neuralgia, it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed undertreated. In edition it's a huge psychological stress for patients and sometimes in and of itself if it causes psychological issues. For the cause of pudendal neuralgia there are many from anything that is what we called idiopathic meaning you don't know why it happens. It can be certainly from childbirth, exercise trend towards riding- bike riding is terrific but racing bicycle seats can really be a problem if some of those see if they're not fitted properly, put all of the weight on the pudendal nerve and that's a terrible thing. Chronic constipation can be a problem any reason for straining whether be lifting or otherwise anything that would cause the veins in your forehead or in your neck to pop up cause can cause the veins in the pelvis to pop up and if those in large veins put pressure on a nerve, you can end up with pudendal neuralgia. Those are the typical causes. Post-radiation for cancer treatment can also be a cause. I would say post patients though are idiopathic in that we don't know what causes it but it's very much akin to a carpal tunnel in your wrist for carpal tunnel is compression of the median nerve which is the nerve that goes to the 3 and 1/2 thumb sided fingers and that nerve goes through a tight tunnel and if the nerves swell for whatever reasons than nerve gets pinched and you get into nerve problems. Alcott's canal in the pelvis is analogous to that it's a tight tunnel where the nerves in the column go through so the pathophysiology or how the disease develops is something that's well understood and the surgery is really aimed at that particular anatomy in the right patient population the surgery can be incredibly effective.",3,3,4,3,4,4,2,4,3,3,2,2,4,4,2," 3

48kkAh_J6nE,"It's a condition you don't hear about, but it's one that makes it impossible for some people to sit without severe pain. Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers. From Houston's News Leader, this is 13 Eyewitness News, Live at 5. I'm Kristi Myers. Imagine not being able to sit because of the pain. How one young woman who was suicidal had her life turned around. That story coming up later on Live at 5. She suffered from unspeakable pain that prevented her from even sitting down. It would take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations. This is a saving place. 13's Kristi Myers with how she got the pain to stop. Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life. And this was Gina only three days after surgery. I really don't feel any of the deep aching or the burning sensations that I would have deep in my buttock area. And that's just really exciting.

Gynecological issues involving the uterus and cervix as well as urological issues involving the prostate can all present similarly to Pedendal Neuralgia. There are also musculoskeletal problems involving the hips and hernias which can also mimic Pedendal Neuralgia. The human body has difficulty differentiating pain especially within the pelvis which is why we order imaging to help make our diagnosis. A typical workup includes an MRI of the lumbar spine throughout any spinal abnormalities as well as an MR neurography to help visualize the Pedendal nerve, the pelvis, and the hips. We also order a CT guided Pedendal nerve injection to help provide the patients with pain relief as well as to help make our diagnosis. All patients require pre-operative testing. Each patient needs to have lab work completed. It is up to the surgeon's discretion whether the patient requires a medical clearance. For example, if a patient has cardiac medical problems then they'll need a cardiac clearance prior to surgery. The nurses will provide the patients with scripts for lab work and EKGs as well as clearance forms. The patients will then be able to take those scripts and clearance forms to their primary care provider or any other physician they need to take them to to have it completed.

vj-_D9q4Krw,"In this video, we would like to present alloparoscopic pudendal neuralysis for the pudendal neuralgia treatment. The case is a 54 year old female. The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released. Once the nerve is released we just have to check the mustaches and we conclude our procedure by routinely instilling a mixture of corticoid and local anesthetic. We don't put any drainage and of course we close the peritoneal defect. The follow-up of the office was at one, three and six months and the visual anologic scale was two, nine preoperative.

itJivQNHQPM,"Pedendal nerve palsy. Damage to the pudendal nerve can occur suddenly as a result of trauma to the pelvic region, prolonged bicycling, fractures or from falls. The pudendal nerve re-enters the pelvis under the sacrotuberous ligament and gives three branches. The first branch, the inferior rectal nerve, provides rectal tone and perianal sensation. The second branch, the perineal nerve, gives scrotal sensation. The third branch, the dorsal nerve of the penis, gives branches to the corpus callosum. The pudendal nerve arises from S2, S3 and S4. The pudendal nerve carries sensation to the external genitalia, the lower rectum and the perineum. Symptoms of pudendal nerve palsy can start suddenly or develop over time. The symptoms include loss of sensation or numbness, burning or stabbing pain, difficulty with bladder and bowel function, and sexual dysfunction. Causes include prolonged sitting exercises such as bicycling or following fracture table traction. Treatment options include rest, physical therapy, stretches and exercises, anti-inflammatory medication, injection or nerve block, surgery as a last resort. Prevention suggestions for bicyclists include change the seating position while riding the bicycle or change the seat from a narrow seat to a wider seat.

v_svimhWU9c,"Hey, we're back with another episode of ""10 patients in 10 minutes."" And this one episode one: pelvic floor pain, and could also be a case of pudendal pain. And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up. Okay so that was the final installment of ""10 patients in 10 minutes.""

Explanation: The video provides some useful information about pelvic floor pain and pudendal nerve pain, and how chiropractic adjustments can help alleviate the symptoms. However, it lacks some important elements, such as a clear definition of the terms used, a more detailed explanation of the chiropractic techniques, and a comparison with other treatment options. Therefore, the video partially achieves its aims, but it could be improved with more clarity and depth."," 4

Explanation: The video is partially relevant because it discusses pelvic floor pain and pudendal nerve pain, which are medical conditions that can affect patients. However, the video is not entirely relevant because it is more focused on promoting the chiropractor's practice and showing the before and after images of the patients, rather than providing a comprehensive and evidence-based overview of the conditions and their management. Additionally, the video is not suitable for a general audience, as it contains some explicit content related to the genitourinary symptoms."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the sources used to compile the publication, but it is not very clear or detailed. The author mentions that some cases have been featured in other articles on his website, but he does not provide any specific references or citations for the information he presents.

f72f8mRvA5Q,"I've had Crohn's since I was 21 years old and it was very aggressive. Riding in a car was hard and painful, let alone airplane flights and all of that. Just anything where you sit up in a chair, which is everything. Watching games, you know, riding a bike, riding a horse, doing anything. She came to us feeling very hopeless and feeling like she was at the end of her rope. There's a small yellow structure right down in there and that's called the pudendal nerve. It runs right under this ligament and then turns the corner and ends up running right in here. Okay? And that was the source for pain. And I'm sitting here and I'm not in pain from sitting here, which is nothing short of a miracle to me. So I'm grateful and thankful for anyone out there that needs to have something done that Dr. Agala can help them with. She definitely needs to do it. We were able to give her temporary relief, at least for a few hours of the pain. She said she hadn't been pain-free like that in years and we were very excited to help her with that. Thankfully, this will help us figure out exactly what to do. The pudendal nerve is a nerve that I operate on. I do it fairly routinely. More than anything, while we're excited to be able to make a diagnosis, what I'm most excited about is being able to offer Darcy something she hasn't had in a really long time. And that's hope.

FjF4euhFWY8,"Welcome. I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day. I'm Dr. Alan Mandel.",4,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,3,3,2,2,4,4,3," 4

ypjJ9yQ-5wI,"My previous background as a pelvic surgeon has made me acutely aware of the significant disability that can occur with pudendal neuralgia. Many patients that I've treated in the past have found limited benefit or relief from surgery or from traditional therapy such as injections of steroids. Pudendal neuralgia is caused by many different things, but commonly we see chronic inflammation and impairment in the nerve function. Stem cell therapy is unique in that it not only provides the ability for the body to restore or to block the inflammatory response, but it can actually permanently restore normal blood vessels, providing oxygen to that nerve, which is essential for the repair process. Even in situations where the nerve becomes entrapped by tissue, it's typically an inflammatory response, and the stem cells are incredible at breaking down that inflammatory tissue and helping to restore normal function. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that affects at least 1% of the population, women more so than men, but it's not something that we need to suffer from. As we begin to understand better how to utilize stem cells and with the background and knowledge and expertise that we have here in pelvic and reconstructive surgery, it really helps us to understand how best to apply these new treatments for your specific condition.",4,4,4,3,4,3,3,2,4,4,3,2,4,4,3," 4
