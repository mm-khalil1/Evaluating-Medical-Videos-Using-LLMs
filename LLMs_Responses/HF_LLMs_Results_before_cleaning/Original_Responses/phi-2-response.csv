Explanation:
The video describes Nocturnal Enuresis, which is defined as involuntary voiding of urine greater than twice a month at night. The cause of Nocturnal Enuresis can involve quite a few risk factors, such as incomplete toilet training, greater nighttime urine volume, difficulties in arousal from sleep, and family history. The video also mentions that Nocturnal Enuresis can sometimes be caused by organic conditions, such as diabetes and urinary tract infections, as well as problems with anatomy, such as issues with the ureter or bladder sphincter.
In terms of a diagnostic workup, the video suggests obtaining a good history from the patient and their parent, asking about any pain during urination that can help explore a urinary tract infection, and checking for polyuria during the day, which can help explore diabetes. The video also mentions that a urine analysis can help rule out a urinary tract infection, and a basic blood glucose level can help quickly explore the possibility of diabetes. If Nocturnal Enuresis has not gone away and is becoming very troublesome, the video suggests using a bed wetting alarm, which has a 70% success rate. If the bed wetting alarm is not successful,"," 4/5
Explanation:
The video describes Nocturnal Enuresis as involuntary voiding of urine greater than twice a month at night. The cause of Nocturnal Enuresis can involve quite a few risk factors. And some of those include uncompleted toilet training, greater nighttime urine volume, difficulties in arousal from sleep. In addition, family history is actually also associated with Nocturnal Enuresis. It runs in families. One very important aspect to the etiology of Nocturnal Enuresis is sometimes there can be organic causes, medical conditions. And the two most common are diabetes and a urinary tract infection. So those two things should be explored during the diagnostic workup. And one final thing I wanted to mention is sometimes problems with anatomy can contribute. So for example, if there's a problem with the ureter or if there's a problem with the bladder sphincter, then that can also contribute. In terms of a diagnostic workup, the very first thing you need to do is obtain a good history from the patient and the parent, of course, because you're talking about children. So ask, is there any pain during urination that can help explore a urinary tract infection? Ask if there"," 5/5

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a optimistic tone.

Answer:
Bedwetting is a common issue that many families face every night. It is important to know that bedwetting is not a sign of any deeper medical or emotional issues, and most children eventually grow out of it. In fact, about 15% of children age 5 wet their bed, and this number decreases by 1% per year over the next 10 years. By the time a child is 15, only 1 to 2% of them are still bedwetters. Surprisingly, even in adults, about 1% are still bedwetters occasionally.

It is important to understand that bedwetting is not a disease or an illness. It is simply a step in development that hasn't completed. There are two common ways to treat bedwetting: medication or using a wetness alarm. However, medication is not always the best option. The medication works by turning off the production of urine by the kidneys. But the problem is not with the kidneys"," 4

It covers both genetic and environmental factors, as well as behavioural and medical interventions. It also acknowledges the emotional and psychological aspects of bedwetting, and does not stigmatize or blame the children or their parents. However, the video could have included more information on the long-term effects of bedwetting, such as social isolation, low self-esteem, or academic performance.

Explanation: The video does refer to areas of uncertainty, such as the causes of bedwetting and the effectiveness of different treatments. The video mentions some possible factors that can contribute to bedwetting, such as genetics, bladder and brain coordination, and emotional and psychological issues.

However, the video does not provide enough evidence or details to support these claims, and it does not address some important questions, such as how to diagnose bedwetting, when to seek medical help, and what are the risks and benefits of different treatments. Therefore, the video does not provide a comprehensive or accurate overview of bedwetting, and it does not help the viewers to make informed decisions about their own or their children's health.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works, but it does not explain how each treatment works in detail.

1. ""Usually 85% of those kids will kind of figure it out. Yes, without any intervention that usually resolves on its own and usually by the time they hit puberty.""

But really it's a combination of factors. That they produce more urine at night, they have smaller bladders, and that they are deep sleepers. So that combination kind of ends up leading to the bedwetting. We also know a lot more now than maybe our parents even did about kind of the long term effects if you don't handle it well. So let's talk a little bit about your suggestions for what parents can do, how they should handle it.

1. ""However, a lot of work done in the 90s had looked for ways to repair the myelomeningocele prenatally. And the researchers had shown that prenatal repair was effective in protecting the existing neural elements from continued injury in utero, as well as preventing spinal fluid leak from the myelomeningocele itself with a secondary effect of restoration of more normal CSF hydrodynamics. All of this work had resulted in a large randomized control trial that was published approximately 10 years ago. This trial is called the Management of Myelomeningocele, or MOMS trial, and the investigators had found improvements in rates of symptomatic hydrocephalus that required treatment, as well as improved motor outcomes in a number of the patients that were repaired prenatally. The benefits to the infants, however, did not come without risks.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The narrator explains that the traditional way to treat myelomeningocele is to repair it after the baby is born. However, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has gained traction worldwide. Several centers within the United States have started fetal programs for myelomeningocele. In addition, other groups, mainly actually in Europe as well as South America, have attempted to complete the myelomeningocele repair through a purely percutaneous approach involving the placement of the laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments in a minimally invasive fashion through the skin. While this minimally invasive approach has mainly been done outside of the United States, here at USC we've collaborated with a group in Miami to try and bring this technique here. We are currently conducting a phase one study to evaluate its safety, and our goal is to try and achieve similar outcomes for our infants as the MOMS trial while improving maternal outcomes.

Explanation: The aims of the video are clear. The video explains that the operation is done to improve the function of the baby, to improve their leg strength and perhaps their bowel and bladder function and also importantly to minimize their risk of developing hydrocephalus that conditioned fluid on the brain. The patient is Naomi, she's 23 years old and this is essentially her first pregnancy to this point and the baby is around 25 weeks gestation, remembering of course that a normal pregnancy gestation is around 40 weeks so we're just a little tiny bit over halfway in the pregnancy. The baby has an open spinal defect called a spina bifida and the object of the surgery today is to close that lesion for a number of reasons. The leakage of the fluid out of this open lesion does two things at least that we know of. One is to expose the nerves to the amniotic fluid and two is to allow the leaking of fluid such that the cerebellum at the base of the brain can undergo pressure, this is called a Chiari 2 malformation and that kind of pressure on the intracranial structures can result both in issues with the cerebellum and with the ventricles of the brain so"," 4/5

Title: Spina Bifida: A Challenging Condition

Introduction:
Spina bifida is a condition that affects some babies before they are born. It happens when the spine does not develop properly, causing problems with the nerves and muscles. In this section, we will learn more about spina bifida and how it can impact a child's life.

What is Spina Bifida?
Spina bifida is a condition where the spine does not close completely during pregnancy. This can happen when the baby is still growing inside the mother's womb. There are different types of spina bifida, but the most common one is called spina bifida occulta. This type does not cause any symptoms and does not affect the child's health.

Types of Spina Bifida:
1. Spina Bifida Occulta: This is the most common type of spina bifida."," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment. It mentions that fetal surgery can reduce the need for a shunt, preserve nerve function, and minimize the effects of spina bifida. It also mentions that Texas Children's Hospital has a multidisciplinary team that works together to provide the best care for patients with spina bifida.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It mentions that there are risks associated with fetal surgery, but also mentions that it can reduce the need for a shunt and preserve nerve function. It also mentions that Texas Children's has a team of experts who work together to provide the best care possible.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life.

In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible.

A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back.

Transcript: ""A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about.1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number.

Title: Understanding Cluster Headaches

Introduction:
In this section, we will learn about a type of headache called a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are not very common, but they can cause a lot of pain and discomfort. We will explore what causes cluster headaches, how they are different from other types of headaches, and how they can be treated.

A cluster headache is a type of headache that occurs in clusters or groups. This means that a person may have several cluster headaches in a row, followed by a period of time when they don't have any headaches. Cluster headaches usually happen on one side of the head, around the eye or temple area. They can be very intense and last for a short period of time, usually 30 to 90 minutes.

It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number. They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch. Robert, get well soon. We'll be right back..""

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a high school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a optimistic tone.

Answer:
Cluster headaches are a rare but distinct clinical entity that occur in approximately 0.4% of the population. These headaches are characterized by intense, stabbing pain that usually occurs on one side of the head and is often centered around the orbits or supraorbital area. Unlike migraine headaches, cluster headaches are predominantly a male disorder that typically begins between the ages of 20 and 50, with a male-to-female ratio of 4 to 1.

During a cluster headache, the pain can last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to up to 2 to 3 hours. Autonomic features such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, meiosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema are all part of the syndrome. Patients are then headache-free between clusters.

Explanation: The video is clear when the information used or reported in the transcript was produced. The speaker provides accurate and up-to-date information about cluster headaches, tension-type headaches, migraine, and allodynia.
"," 5
Explanation: The video is balanced and unbiased because it presents information about different types of headaches, their symptoms, and treatment options without favoring any specific type or treatment. It also acknowledges that there is still much to learn about migraines and that new information is constantly being discovered.
"," 5
Explanation: The video provides details of additional sources of support and information. It mentions that there are different types of headaches with different ways of presenting, but the only commonality between tension-type headache and migraine is central sensitization after a while. It also mentions that in migraine patients, central sensitization can lead to allodynia, which is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. Lastly, it mentions that not all migraine patients respond to atriptan, a common treatment for migraines.
"," 4
Explanation: The transcript refers to areas of uncertainty, such as the difference between cluster headache and migraine, the cause of central sensitization, and the effectiveness of atriptan in patients with allodynia.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works, but it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of how each treatment works. For example, the video mentions that atriptan works by hitting the 5-HT, B, D, and F subreceptors, but it does not explain how these receptors are involved in migraine or how atriptan affects them. Similarly, the video mentions that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to treat migraine, but it does not explain how NSAIDs work or why they are effective. Overall, the video provides a good overview of the different treatments for migraine, but it could benefit from more detailed explanations of how each treatment works.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and atriptan. It also explains the concept of central sensitization, which is a common feature of both tension-type headache and migraine. The video provides detailed information about the different types of headaches and their characteristics, as well as the mechanisms of action of various treatments. Overall, the video is informative and provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with each type of headache. For example, it does not mention that cluster headaches can be life-threatening if left untreated, or that migraine can be associated with other serious health conditions such as stroke and heart attack. Additionally, the video does not discuss the potential side effects of the treatments mentioned, such as nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. Therefore, while the video provides some useful information about the risks of each treatment, it does not provide a complete picture of the risks associated with each type of headache.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used for cluster headache, but it does not mention what would happen if no treatment is used for tension-type headache or migraine. Therefore, the score is 4.
"," 4
Explanation: The video does describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that cluster headache patients cannot lie down and have to walk to alleviate the pain. It also mentions that migraine patients can develop allodynia, which is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. This information is relevant to the overall quality of life of patients with these conditions.
"," 5
Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The speaker mentions non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a first-line treatment for tension-type headache, and atriptan as a second-line treatment for tension-type headache. The speaker also mentions that atriptan may not work for patients with allodynia, which is a symptom of central sensitization that can occur in migraine patients. This suggests that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for tension-type headache, depending on the individual patient's symptoms and response to treatment.
"," 4
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making because it acknowledges that there are different types of headaches with different ways of presenting, but the only commonality between tension-type headache and migraine is central sensitization after a while. It also mentions that in migraine patients, central sensitization can lead to allodynia, which is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. This information can help patients make informed decisions about their treatment options.

Title: Understanding Cluster Headaches

Introduction:
In this section, we will learn about a type of headache called cluster headaches. Cluster headaches can be very painful and can affect a person's daily life. We will explore what causes cluster headaches, how they can be treated, and the experiences of someone who has suffered from them.

What are Cluster Headaches?
Cluster headaches are a type of headache that can last for a short period of time, usually between 15 minutes to four hours. They occur in clusters, which means that a person may have several headaches in a row, followed by a period of relief. Cluster headaches are different from other types of headaches, such as tension headaches or migraines.

Causes of Cluster Headaches:
The exact cause of cluster headaches is not known, but scientists believe that they may be related to changes in the brain. Some possible triggers for cluster headaches include stress, certain foods, alcohol, and changes in sleep"," 4
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the available treatments for cluster headaches. It focuses primarily on Robert's experience with oxygen treatment, but it does not mention other potential treatments such as triptans or preventive medications. Additionally, the video does not provide any information about the potential side effects or risks associated with these treatments. Therefore, while the video does describe the benefits of each treatment, it does not provide a complete picture of all the available options for treating cluster headaches.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a rare and severe type of headache that typically occur in clusters or cycles. They are often accompanied by other symptoms such as watery eyes, nasal congestion, and drooping eyelids. Cluster headaches can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, alcohol consumption, and changes in sleep patterns. Treatment for cluster headaches typically involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. Medications used to treat cluster headaches include triptans, ergotamine, and oxygen therapy. Lifestyle changes that may help to reduce the frequency and severity of cluster headaches include regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule.
"," 4
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video mentions that Robert has been suffering from cluster headaches for three months, and that he has been to doctors and neurologists, but nothing has helped. The video also mentions that he has been using oxygen treatment, which is a common treatment for cluster headaches. The video does not mention any other treatments, such as medication, surgery, or alternative therapies. Therefore, the video implies that if no treatment is used, Robert will continue to suffer from cluster headaches, which can be very painful and debilitating. The video also implies that Robert's work and personal life will be affected by his cluster headaches, as he may have to miss work, sleep on the couch, and struggle to perform his duties. The video does not mention any positive outcomes, such as relief, improvement, or recovery. Therefore, the video does not describe what would happen if no treatment is used, but rather what would happen if Robert continues to suffer from cluster headaches.

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mentions that Robert has tried Imitrex and a steroid, and that Dr. Kudrow is convinced that Robert has episodic cluster headache. The video also mentions that Robert's headaches are defined as number three headaches, or the most severe types.
"," 4
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making. The video begins with a personal story, which is a good way to connect with the audience. The video then explains the different types of headaches, which is important for the audience to understand. Finally, the video mentions that Robert has seen a doctor and is now receiving treatment, which shows that he is taking an active role in his healthcare.

Explanation: The video provides details of additional sources of support and information. It mentions the rare headache syndrome called cluster headache and how it is thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. It also mentions the treatments for cluster headache, including nerve blocks, botox, and surgery. Finally, it mentions that the same nerve goes down to the nose and how rubbing capsaicin in the nose can cause desensitization to pain.
"," 5
Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty. The researchers are not sure why capsaicin causes desensitization, but they think it has something to do with the release of substance P. They also are not sure why the desensitization wears off, but they think it has something to do with the nerve making more substance P from scratch. Finally, they are not sure why the desensitization only works on one side of the head, but they think it has something to do with the trigeminal nerve going down to the nose on one side and not the other.

Explanation: The video describes how capsaicin works in the nose to desensitize the trigeminal nerve, which transmits pain signals from the face to the brain. It also explains how this desensitization can be used to treat cluster headaches, which are one-sided headaches that cause intense pain on one side of the head. The video provides evidence from a study that shows that capsaicin can reduce the frequency and severity of cluster headache attacks, and that some patients are even cured. The video also acknowledges that capsaicin may not work for everyone, and that it may have some side effects, such as sneezing, burning, and snotting.

Answer:
In this section, we will discuss the risks associated with different treatments. It is important to understand these risks in order to make informed decisions about our health.

One treatment that has been studied is the use of hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a type of severe headache that can cause intense pain on one side of the head. Researchers wanted to see if applying capsaicin, the burning component of hot peppers, to the nose could help alleviate these headaches.

During the experiment, medical students were asked to apply capsaicin to their noses. They experienced a burning sensation, sneezing, and a runny nose. The pain was described as being around 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. Surprisingly, when the experiment was repeated the next day, the students reported that the pain was less intense. This led researchers to believe that the nerves in the nose had become desensitized to the capsaicin.

In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of medical research and the potential benefits of using capsaicin, a compound found in hot peppers, to treat cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are known to be one of the most painful conditions experienced by humans, often leading individuals to consider taking their own lives due to the intensity of the pain. However, researchers have discovered a promising treatment option that involves applying capsaicin to the nose.

Capsaicin is the component responsible for the burning sensation in hot peppers. While it may seem counterintuitive to apply a substance that causes pain to the nose, researchers decided to investigate its effects on cluster headaches. They conducted a study using medical students as participants, dripping capsaicin into their noses and observing the resulting symptoms.

During the experiment, the students experienced intense burning, sneezing, and a runny nose when capsaicin was applied to their noses. The pain was rated on a scale"," 5

For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy.

Explanation: The transcript refers to areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis and treatment of trigger finger. For example, it mentions that the exact cause of trigger finger is unknown, and that it can occur after a carpal tunnel release for an unknown reason. It also mentions that there are different treatment modalities, such as anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, acupuncture, steroid injection, and surgical intervention, and that the effectiveness of each modality may vary depending on the patient. Therefore, the score is 4 out of 5.
"," 4/5
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. It explains that trigger finger is caused by edema and fibrosis in the A1 pulley or flexor tendon sheath, which traps the tendon under the A1 pulley and prevents it from extending the thumb completely. It also explains that trigger finger can occur in people with diabetes or after a carpal tunnel release, but the exact cause is unknown. The video then describes how to prevent trigger finger by doing light massage over the A1 pulley and making a fist with the affected thumb. It also describes different treatment modalities for trigger finger, including anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, acupuncture, and steroid injections. If these modalities don't work, the last option is surgical intervention. The video also suggests some lifestyle changes that can help prevent trigger finger, such as exercising every day, staying healthy, drinking more water, and eating more fruits, nuts, vegetables, and grains.

Therefore, while the video does provide some information about the risks of trigger finger surgery, it does not provide a complete picture of the risks associated with the procedure.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video explains that trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The video explains that the inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. The video explains that once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. The video explains that we generally have two tendons in each finger. The video explains that the first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The video explains that the second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. The video explains that once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. The video explains that this will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then"," 4

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. It mentions that there are two tendons in each finger and that the surgeon lifts up on one of the tendons to make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. It also mentions that the surgeon can move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely.

Explanation: The video does describe how each treatment works, but it does not provide a complete explanation of the mechanism of trigger finger and trigger thumb. For example, it does not mention that trigger finger is caused by a thickening of the flexor tendon that gets caught in the pulley, or that trigger thumb is caused by a shortening of the flexor pollicis longus tendon that gets caught in the pulley. It also does not mention that trigger finger and trigger thumb can be prevented or treated by avoiding repetitive or forceful movements of the affected fingers, by wearing splints or braces, or by taking anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroid injections. Therefore, I would give the video a score of 4 out of 5, as it provides a good overview of the topic, but it could be improved by adding more details and examples.

The video explains that the inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. The video explains that once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. The video explains that we generally have two tendons in each finger. The video explains that the first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The video explains that the second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. The video explains that once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. The video explains that this will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's"," 4

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a calm tone.

Answer:
Trigger thumb is a condition that can cause pain and discomfort in the thumb. It happens when the tendon in the thumb gets stuck or caught, making it difficult to move the thumb. This can make it hard to do everyday tasks like picking up objects or opening jars.

There are different types of trigger thumb, but the most common one is called nodule adhesion. This happens when the tendon in the thumb gets stuck to the sheath that surrounds it. The sheath is like a protective covering for the tendon. When the tendon gets stuck, it can","Instruction: You are a medical expert.

It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching.

You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds.

Explanation: The video does a good job of explaining how trigger thumb works and how to treat it. The exercises are clearly demonstrated and explained. However, the video does not provide any information on how to prevent trigger thumb from occurring in the first place. It would be helpful to include some tips on how to avoid trigger thumb, such as practicing proper hand and wrist positioning during activities that put stress on the thumb joint. Additionally, the video does not mention the importance of rest and recovery in the treatment of trigger thumb. It would be beneficial to include information on how often to rest the thumb and when to seek medical attention if symptoms persist. Overall, the video provides a good overview of trigger thumb and how to treat it, but it could be improved by including more information on prevention and recovery.

Explanation: The video does not describe the benefits of each treatment. It only briefly mentions that trigger thumb is caused by nodule adhesion that affects the flexor tendon. It also mentions that the thumb joint is a strong joint that is subject to trauma and injury. However, it does not provide any specific information about the benefits of the treatments mentioned in the video, such as cross fiber friction or thumb up isolated exercises. The video also does not provide any information about the duration or frequency of the treatments, which are important factors in determining the effectiveness of the treatments. Overall, the video provides a basic overview of trigger thumb and some general information about the treatments, but it does not provide enough detail to accurately describe the benefits of each treatment.

I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here.

Explanation: The video does a good job of describing how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains that trigger thumb is caused by nodule adhesion that affects the flexor tendon, and that the thumb joint is a stronger joint than the other fingers. It also explains that the thumb joint needs specific attention to it because it is subject to more trauma and injury. The video provides a series of exercises that can help break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon and allow it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. The exercises include thumb up isolated, elbow moving, supinated, and thumb up and supinated. The video explains that these exercises can help enhance the strength of the thumb joint and thin the tendon, which can help correct the muscle imbalance and improve overall quality of life.

You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Explanation: The transcript refers to areas of uncertainty in the following ways:
1. ""Maybe some of you have experienced this problem. What causes trigger finger? Normally, when we flex our finger, there is a long tendon that pulls the finger and helps it smoothly slide through a protective sheath that surrounds it. In cases of trigger finger, the protective sheath can become inflamed with repeated use such as typing, texting, and other hand manipulations. When the sheath is inflamed, the tendon cannot slide smoothly, thereby causing the finger to click. It can affect any finger. It can affect the thumb. With repeated clicks, the tendon can also become inflamed, causing a nodule like a scar to form. I'll show you the picture. Okay, I'll show you the picture. So this is a picture of how our hand works. We have tendons that attach to our finger bones, and this is how we bend our fingers. In cases of trigger finger, as you can see, there is a nodule at the base of the finger, and this causes the painful clicking. What are the risk factors for having trigger finger?

Explanation: The aims of the video are clear. The video starts with an introduction and then goes on to explain the pros and cons of being on your toes and being flat-footed. The video then concludes with a summary of the pros and cons of both stances. The video is well-structured and easy to follow.

##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a proud tone.

Answer:
In this section, we will learn about two different stances in boxing: being on your toes and being flat-footed. Both stances have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it's important to understand them in order to become a better boxer.

Being on your toes means that your feet are positioned in a way that allows you to move quickly and generate power in your punches. When you are on your toes, you can throw punches faster and with more force. This can be helpful when you need to defend yourself or attack your opponent. However, being on your toes requires a lot of energy and can be tiring if you have to do it for a long time.

Transcript: ""Flat feet are typically caused by a bone inside the foot that is hypermobile and comes out of alignment. It's called the talus bone. And if you can use the analogy of a stone bridge, that if you have stones that come up to the center of the bridge, and you pluck out that middle stone, then the bridge collapses. Well, essentially, in the foot, the talus bone, which is inside the ankle joint, acts like that stone bridge and that center stone. And typically what happens with a flat foot is that the talus bone migrates forward on ambulation. So when a person steps down and puts their full weight, the talus moves forward like this, which then causes the midfoot to unlock. And then you have a flat foot. Now, we do have treatments for this condition. And typically you do want to treat a flat foot because if you don't, there can be issues with ankle pain, with knee pain, hip pain, and back pain.

Looking at the red line below in the blue, and now we can see that little blue line near the implant is now elevated along with the arch.

Participating in any sporting activity is almost impossible, yet she has been a real trooper and trying to persevere. And she was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of this problem. And as you can see, that's not the case. We're now going to see the post-operative results on the right here. You can see the straight line that I drew showing the new position of the foot. Again, here we're looking on your left side, which is the right foot. We're seeing a much straighter foot with a restoration of the arch. Again, we're seeing the arch on the right foot, which is pretty dramatic, relative to the left side, which shows here no arch and a completely collapsed foot, which is not functional at all. In this picture, we're looking at the titanium calcaneal graft that was put in here to lengthen the lateral column and help restore the arch. And now we're looking at the top of the foot where a similar graft was placed into the menial cuneiform to help bring the arch more prominent. This is the preoperative x-ray where you'll note the lines that I've drawn that help indicate the deformity. Looking at the red line below in the blue, and now we can see that little blue line near the implant is now elevated along with the arch. And we can see all the implants in the foot that brought the arch up. This is the before picture where you see the foot is completely turning outward and the proximal portion is going inward. And this is the postoperative result, which is very dramatic. You can see the foot is perfectly straight now and looks much better as it did in the video. Here we're looking at her walk now three months out, which has just only been walking now for a couple of weeks, and already it's dramatic the improvement. Again now we'll look at the x-ray preoperatively and postoperatively next to each other and you can see the dramatic improvement.

However sometimes if the foot is more stiff and rigid or if arthritis has already set in or if it's an older patient we'll elect for arthrodesis which is the same as a fusion so we'll fuse the hind foot to stabilize the arch and to improve the function of the foot.

With the patient lying on her left side, we make an incision 2 cm dorsal to the fibular point, which follows the course of the peroneal tendons. While sparing the peroneal tendons, the nervus suralis and the vena saphena parva, we incise the periosteum of the calcaneus at the level of the planned osteotomy. Using the fluoro for guidance, we determine the osteotomy line. To ensure a planar osteotomy area, we perform an osteotomy with the oscillating saw through a cutting gauge. The osteotomy runs transversally from proximal dorsal to distal plantar at an angle of approximately 45°. Next, we mobilize the dorsal fragment with a wide chisel and move it medially by one centimeter.
