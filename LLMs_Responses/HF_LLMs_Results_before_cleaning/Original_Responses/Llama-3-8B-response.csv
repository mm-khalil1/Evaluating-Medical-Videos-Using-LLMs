Therefore, if no treatment is used, the child may continue to experience enuresis until they are 7 years old or until the underlying cause is treated."," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that reassurance is enough for most cases, as some children will outgrow the problem.

Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The doctor mentions two common ways to treat bedwetting: medication and a wetness alarm. He also mentions that the medication is not the best solution, and that the wetness alarm is a better solution. He explains how the wetness alarm works and the success rate of using it. He also mentions that the success rate of the wetness alarm is excellent, and that it takes about three weeks for the brain to realize that it's not keeping track of the bladder at night. He also mentions that the statistics with wetting alarms are excellent, and that within three weeks, about 75% of the children manage to respond to the alarm initially. He also mentions that the children should continue to use the alarm for six months continuously after their last wet night. He also mentions that bedwetting is not a disease, and that the kids are the smarter kids in the class. He also mentions that the parents should give the children lots of encouragement, and that they should assure the children that this is something that will stop spontaneously. He also mentions that the parents should not push the children to stop wetting unless the children are really motivated. He"," 5
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making because it presents the pros and cons of two treatment options for bedwetting, including the success rate of each option. It also provides information on how to use the wetness alarm, which is a behavioral modification technique that can help children overcome bedwetting. The video also encourages parents to be supportive and understanding of their children's bedwetting, which is important for shared decision-making. Additionally, the video provides information on how to use pull-ups, which can help children feel more comfortable and confident in their ability to stay dry at night. Overall, the video provides a balanced and informative presentation of the available treatment options for bedwetting, which can help parents and children make an informed decision about the best course of action.

Transcript: ""Bedwetting refers to uncontrolled urination. Children who wet the bed do it neither consciously nor deliberately. Primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy. Persistent bedwetting, that is bedwetting that occurs at least once a week or more, is typically not considered to be a problem until your child reaches school age"," 5
Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty because it states that children who wet the bed do it neither consciously nor deliberately. This is an area of uncertainty because it is not clear whether children who wet the bed do it consciously or deliberately. The video also states that primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy. This is an area of uncertainty because it is not clear whether young children lack bladder control from infancy or whether they simply have not yet developed the ability to control their bladder. Finally, the video states that secondary bedwetting accounts for approximately one in four of all bedwetting cases. This is an area of uncertainty because it is not clear whether secondary bedwetting accounts for one in four of all bedwetting cases or whether it accounts for a smaller or larger percentage.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. It explains that primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy, and that secondary bedwetting occurs when a child or adolescent has maintained proper control over their bladder during the night for at least six months or more and then begins to wet the bed again. It also explains that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are ones who took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. The video provides a clear and concise explanation of the causes and treatments for bedwetting, making it easy for viewers to understand and apply the information to their own lives.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains that primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy, and secondary bedwetting occurs when a child or adolescent has maintained proper control over their bladder during the night for at least six months or more and then begins to wet the bed again. The video also explains that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are ones who typically took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. This information is useful for parents who want to help their children overcome bedwetting problems."," 5
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It mentions that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are those who took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. This is a risk factor that can be addressed by the treatment. The video also mentions that secondary bedwetting can be particularly distressing for all involved. This is a risk that can be addressed by the treatment. The video does not mention any other risks of the treatment, but it does not need to because the risks mentioned are sufficient to make the treatment effective.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It mentions that children who wet the bed do it neither consciously nor deliberately, and that primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy. It also mentions that secondary bedwetting occurs when a child or adolescent has maintained proper control over their bladder during the night for at least six months or more and then begins to wet the bed again. This suggests that if no treatment is used, the child may continue to wet the bed, which could lead to social and emotional problems. Therefore, I believe the video accurately describes what would happen if no treatment is used.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are those who took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. This suggests that the treatment choices can have a significant impact on the overall quality of life of children with secondary bedwetting.
"," 5
Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mentions two types of bedwetting: primary and secondary. It also mentions that secondary bedwetting is more common in older children and adolescents. The video does not mention any specific treatments for bedwetting, but it does mention that there are different types of bedwetting, which suggests that there may be different treatments for each type. The video also mentions that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are those who took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. This suggests that there may be different treatments for children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting. Overall, the video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for bedwetting.
"," 5
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making because it provides information about the different types of bedwetting and the factors that may contribute to it. It also discusses the potential causes of secondary bedwetting, which can help parents and children make informed decisions about treatment options. Additionally, the video includes a discussion of the potential impact of bedwetting on children and families, which can help parents and children understand the importance of seeking treatment.

"," 5
Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty by mentioning that the cause of primary bed wetting is ""an inability to recognize the messages sent by the bladder to the sleeping brain."" This suggests that the cause of primary bed wetting is not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism behind it. Additionally, the video mentions that ""the cure for primary bed wetting is the passage of time,"" which implies that there is no known cure for primary bed wetting, and that it may resolve on its own as the child matures. Finally, the video mentions that ""secondary bed wetting is due to a routine infection sorry urine infections or diabetes and other underlying medical conditions,"" which suggests that the cause of secondary bed wetting is not fully understood, and that further research is needed to determine the exact causes and treatments for this condition. Overall, the video refers to areas of uncertainty in several places, and therefore receives a score of 5.

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The speaker is trying to explain the causes of bedwetting, but the explanation is not very clear. The speaker mentions that bedwetting is a little more common than people are aware, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The speaker also mentions that bedwetting has a relationship to how we're breathing and our quality of sleep, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The speaker does not provide any specific recommendations for how to treat bedwetting, which makes the aims of the video less clear.

Explanation: The video is relevant because it discusses the relationship between bedwetting and breathing. The speaker explains that bedwetting can be caused by a lack of oxygen in the brain, which triggers a fight-or-flight response that causes the body to pull oxygen from the urinary tract. This is a valid explanation for bedwetting, and it is relevant to the topic of medical expertise.

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty because it discusses the relationship between bedwetting and breathing. The video also mentions that the brain may pull oxygen from the urinary tract, which could lead to bedwetting. This is an area of uncertainty because it is not clear whether this is a common cause of bedwetting or if it is a rare occurrence. The video does not provide any evidence to support this claim, so it is an area of uncertainty.
"," 3
Explanation: The video describes how bedwetting is related to breathing and sleep, but it does not describe how each treatment works. The video mentions that bedwetting is related to the way oxygen is exchanged in the body, but it does not explain how this relates to bedwetting. The video also mentions that the brain triggers a fight or flight response when it detects a lack of oxygen, but it does not explain how this leads to bedwetting. The video does not provide any information about how treatments for bedwetting work, such as how they help the body exchange oxygen more effectively or how they help the brain regulate its fight or flight response. Therefore, I would rate this video as a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means 'no,' 2 to 4 means 'partially,' and 5 means 'yes.'"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains that bedwetting is a common problem that can be caused by poor breathing habits. The video also explains that the brain can trigger a fight or flight response when it detects a lack of oxygen, which can lead to bedwetting. The video provides a clear explanation of the benefits of each treatment and how they can help to prevent bedwetting.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It explains that bedwetting is a common problem that is often not discussed. It also explains that bedwetting can be caused by poor breathing habits, which can lead to a lack of oxygen in the brain. The video then goes on to explain that the brain will try to compensate for this lack of oxygen by pulling oxygen from other parts of the body, including the urinary tract. This can lead to bedwetting. The video also explains that this is a rare occurrence and that the brain is only trying to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Overall, the video provides a thorough explanation of the risks of each treatment and how they can lead to bedwetting.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video explains that bedwetting is a common problem that is often kept secret. It also explains that bedwetting is related to how we breathe and our quality of sleep. The video explains that if we breathe through our mouth, the air that enters our lungs is not filtered, warmed, or humidified properly, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen to the brain. The video also explains that the brain is a sensitive organ and that it can detect even small changes in oxygen levels. When the brain detects a decrease in oxygen, it triggers a fight-or-flight response, which can cause the body to pull oxygen from the urinary tract, leading to bedwetting. The video does not mention any treatments for bedwetting, but it does explain that bedwetting is a common problem that is often kept secret. Therefore, I believe that the video describes what would happen if no treatment is used.

The video also mentions that some of the causes for bedwetting relate to the way oxygen is exchanged in our body, and that the way I'll describe it is this. If we're breathing through our mouth, that air coming into the lung isn't really filtered, warmed, or humidified appropriately, and the body can't exchange it appropriately. The video also mentions that a little less oxygen goes to the brain, and that the brain is a very sensitive organ. The video also mentions that when the brain recognizes little changes in oxygen, it goes to work immediately. The video also mentions that once the brain starts to recognize a little less oxygen, it doesn't know if we're being choked to death, a very serious condition, or if there's an imbalance in how we're breathing at night. The video also mentions that the brain's going to look at the body and say, all right, if we've got a little bit of an oxygen issue going on, I"," 5

After the man has pleasured his partner, he can start to pleasure himself in another way. He can bring himself to orgasm through self-stimulation or get his partner to stimulate his penis and come that way.

"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video explains that myelomeningocele is a central nervous system malformation that occurs extremely early in life, and it results from a failure of primary neuralation where the caudal neural port fails to go from a sheet and roll over it to form a tube. The resultant malformation not only affects the spinal cord, but also the nerves, the bones, the muscles, and the skin in the back. There are also secondary effects that can occur in the brain as a result of this malformation lower down in the spinal cord. The video also explains that the traditional way that a myelomeningocele is treated is to repair it after the babies are born. However, a lot of work done in the 90s had looked for ways to repair the myelomeningocele lesion prenatally. And the researchers had shown that prenatal repair was effective in protecting the existing neural elements from continued injury in utero, as well as preventing spinal fluid leak from the myelomeningocele itself with a secondary effect of restoration of more normal CSF hydrodynamics. All of this work had resulted in a large randomized control"," 5

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used.

The video also states that the leakage of fluid can result in issues with the cerebellum and the ventricles of the brain. The video states that by closing the lesion, the leakage of fluid can be prevented, which can preserve neurologic function and even regain some neurologic function. The video also states that the operation went perfectly and that the mother and baby are recovering well. Therefore, the video describes what would happen if no treatment is used.

Transcript: ""Hello, my name is Dr. Gina Miller and I am the leader of the Fetoscopic Spina Bifida Repair Program at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy. In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible.

Transcript: ""Hello, my name is Dr. Gina Miller and I am the leader of the Fetoscopic Spina Bifida Repair Program at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy. In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible. If you have additional questions about this procedure, please contact us. We are always eager to help. Thank you for your attention..""

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty. The video states that the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The video also states that the neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover"," 5

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that the spinal cord is exposed to the intrauterine environment, which causes direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord and injury from the amniotic fluid. It also explains that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, is wedged down into the neck, which can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain. If this blockage is not treated, the water builds up inside the ventricle, which can lead to a massively enlarged head, death, or severe mental retardation. The video also explains that a shunt is placed to minimize the ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, but that it is not a cure and can have multiple complications.

Explanation: The video is relevant because it provides information about spina bifida, a common birth defect that occurs in one to two out of every 1000 live births. The video explains what normally should occur early in fetal development, which is the neural tube. It also explains that in cases of spina bifida, the zipping process doesn't go quite right and there can be a gap in the neural tube that allows those delicate nerves to come out of the body, usually out of the skin and they're damaged, as in exposure to the amniotic fluid. The video also explains that when there is damage to those nerves when the babies are born, we do surgery to repair the opening, but the nerves have usually already suffered some damage. As a result, people or babies with spina bifida or children with spina bifida usually have some degree of paralysis or the inability to use their legs to some extent.

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty. The narrator states that ""we know there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida and those include moms who are diabetic, when there's been a family history of other individuals with a neural tube defect, or some women on certain medications."" However, the narrator also states that ""most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk."" This suggests that there may be other risk factors that are not mentioned in the video. Additionally, the narrator states that ""we recommend that any woman of any childbearing age take a vitamin that has 0.4 milligrams of folic acid,"" but does not provide any evidence to support this recommendation. This suggests that there may be uncertainty about the effectiveness of folic acid in preventing spina bifida.

Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. It explains that spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs in one to two out of every 1000 live births.

The video also explains that there is some degree of damage to those nerves, no matter when we are able to do surgery. The video also explains that spina bifida can happen in any pregnancy to any woman, and that there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida. The video also explains that most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk, and that's why we talk so much about folic acid. The video also explains that folic acid is a B vitamin that we know helps reduce the incidence"," 5
Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice.

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty because it mentions that the neural tube doesn't close completely, leaving a gap. This could indicate that there is some uncertainty about the exact cause of the defect or how it will affect the baby's development. Additionally, the video mentions that the defect is repaired in utero with either an open procedure or the newly developed fetoscopic surgery. This suggests that there is still some uncertainty about which procedure is best for each individual case. Finally, the video mentions that the baby's spine and defect are exposed during the open surgery, which could indicate that there is some uncertainty about the exact location of the defect and how it will be repaired. Overall, the video does refer to areas of uncertainty, which is why I scored it a 5.

Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. It explains that open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect the spine and spinal cord. It also explains that myelomeningocele and myeloschisis are both serious forms of spina bifida and occur when a baby’s spine, spinal cord and spinal canal don’t close as they normally would. The video explains that spina bifida occurs in the first three to four weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when the spinal cord is forming. It also explains that at this point, a baby’s developing brain and spine are referred to as the “neural tube.” The video explains that normally, during these first few weeks of development, the two sides of a baby's back fold to form a tube called the spinal cord. If a baby has an open neural tube defect, the neural tube doesn’t close completely, leaving a small gap. This is the defect. The video explains that with an open neural tube defect such as MMC, the bones of the spine don’t completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. Because the spinal canal remains open, the spinal cord and meninges protrude from the baby’s back. The video explains that"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment by explaining the procedure and the potential outcomes. It also mentions that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation, which suggests that the treatments are effective. Additionally, the video mentions that the baby can be delivered vaginally after fetoscopic surgery, which suggests that the procedure is less invasive than open surgery. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive description of the benefits of each treatment, and I rate it a 5.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It explains that open surgery involves putting the mother to sleep and making incisions in the abdomen and uterus. It also explains that fetoscopic surgery involves making tiny incisions in the abdomen and uterus. Both procedures involve repairing the defect and closing the skin over the opening to protect the neural tissue. The video also explains that the baby will be delivered via c-section after open surgery and vaginally after fetoscopic surgery. This information is important for patients to know so they can make an informed decision about which treatment is right for them. Additionally, the video mentions that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation, which is reassuring for patients who may be considering this treatment option. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with each treatment option, making it an excellent resource for patients considering spina bifida repair.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that the neural tube does not close completely, leaving a gap in the spine. This gap can lead to serious problems, such as spina bifida. The video also explains that the defect can be repaired in utero with either an open procedure or the newly developed fetoscopic surgery. This shows that there is a treatment available for this condition. Overall, the video provides a clear and detailed description of what would happen if no treatment is used, and it also explains the available treatments. Therefore, I give it a score of 5.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains that the treatment choices are open surgery and fetoscopic surgery. It also explains that the fetoscopic surgery is less invasive and can be performed vaginally, while the open surgery requires a c-section. The video also explains that the fetoscopic surgery is a newer procedure and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation. This shows that the treatment choices are effective and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is a reputable facility. The video also explains that the treatment choices are safe and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center has a high success rate. This shows that the treatment choices are effective and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is a reputable facility. The video also explains that the treatment choices are less invasive and that the fetoscopic surgery can be performed vaginally.

The video also explains that the treatment choices are safe and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center has a high success rate. This shows that the treatment choices are effective and that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is a reputable facility. The video also"," 5
Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mentions two different types of surgery, open surgery and fetoscopic surgery, and explains the differences between the two. It also mentions that the baby can be delivered vaginally after fetoscopic surgery, which suggests that there may be other options for delivery after open surgery. Additionally, the video mentions that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation, which suggests that there may be other facilities that offer similar services. Overall, the video provides enough information to suggest that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida.

Transcript: ""A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about.1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number. They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch.

And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home.

They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch.

Transcript: ""A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about.1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video mentions that Robert has been suffering from cluster headaches for several weeks and that he has been prescribed oxygen treatment. However, he has been doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. The video also mentions that when Robert was at his neurologist's office, he was told that he was doing the oxygen treatment wrong. This suggests that Robert has not been receiving the correct treatment for his cluster headaches. Therefore, the video describes what would happen if no treatment is used.

So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number. They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch. Robert, get well soon. We'll be right back..""

Transcript: ""A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about.1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It states that cluster headaches are a particularly severe, nasty form of recurrent headache. It also states that they can be crippling. The video also states that there are some medical therapies for cluster headaches but there's also one at least promising natural remedy that involves the extract of the cayenne pepper plant. This chemical is called capsaicin. The video also states that capsaicin is a naturally occurring irritant. That's why it gives you that hot burning sensation on your tongue when you eat it. It can also be used for pain relief by irritating the nerves that over lie the area of pain. The video also states that some people looked at this and thought, well, maybe we could use this for cluster headaches by squirting a capsaicin spray up into the nostril on the affected side of the head. And based on one relatively small trial, it does seem to be helpful. The video also states that in medicine, we like to see things repeated in multiple trials. We also like to see them put to a test for safety and efficacy in a large population. With the capsaicin spray, that hasn't happened yet"," 5

Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It mentions that the treatments include medications, oxygen tanks, and Vicodin, which are all potentially addictive. It also mentions that the treatments may not be effective for everyone and that some people may need more than one adjustment. The video also mentions that chiropractic can help headaches, which is a risk of the treatment. Overall, the video provides a thorough description of the risks of each treatment and how chiropractic can help headaches.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that the patient tried all kinds of different medications and treatments available to try and get rid of headaches but didn't have any success. It also mentions that the patient went to the hospital most of the time when he had these headaches because it was the only way he could relieve them. The video then goes on to explain that the patient went to the massage therapist and the massage therapist massaged and it helped a lot. However, the pain always came back 10-15 minutes later because the pressure on the nerves was not removed. The video then explains that the patient found a chiropractor who adjusted him and after his first adjustment he never had the headaches again. The video concludes by saying that chiropractic can absolutely help headaches and that it can help not just cluster headaches but also migraine headaches and tension headaches. Therefore, I believe that the video describes what would happen if no treatment is used and I have given it a score of 5.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that cluster headaches are one of the most severe and painful types of headaches, and that they are characterized by intense stabbing pain around one eye, accompanied by tearing, a runny nose, and drooping of the eyelid. It also explains that when the hypothalamus in the brain becomes dysfunctional, signals are sent into a bundle of nerves called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. The SPG acts like a fuse box, connecting the brain to nerve endings in the face. When these signals reach the vessels, they cause dilation and activate pain receptors. Pain signals are returned to the sensory area of the brain, where they are perceived as intense pain. The resulting cascade causes excruciating, one-sided pain around the eye that can radiate to the forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on the affected side. Because of the SPG's unique location in the pain loop, it has long been a treatment target.

The video shows how the surgeon cuts the pulley to release the tendon and then checks to make sure that the tendon is not getting caught or locking. The video also shows how the surgeon closes the wound and explains that there is usually very little post-operative pain. Therefore, I scored the video as a 5, indicating that it describes what would happen if no treatment is used.

Additionally, the narrator mentions that the patient went on to have a second surgery, which could indicate that the first surgery was not successful or that the patient had a different condition that required a different treatment plan. Overall, the video provides enough information to suggest that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger thumbs.

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes.

Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers.

Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized.

The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned.

Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks...""

Transcript: ""Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself.

"," 5
Explanation: The video is clear what sources of information were used to compile the publication (other than the author). The video states that the symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the fingers that is often associated with a nodule or a small bump that can be felt and it can oftentimes be associated with catching or locking of the finger. In very severe cases, this does require manual assistance to obtain full extension of the fingers. Trigger finger is often caused by such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or diabetes, but oftentimes the cause is undetermined. The video also states that if you suspect that you may be suffering from trigger finger, the first thing to do is begin taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve or ibuprofen. This will assist with the pain and will also decrease the inflammation around the tendon. You may also try gentle stretching at home, which would consist of locking the affected finger together and slowly stretching it out to try to stretch the tendon and prevent it from locking or triggering. If this does not work, it is advised to see your local hand surgeon, at which point you may receive a corticosteroid injection into the area of the pain at the base of the"," 5

These pulleys give us a mechanical advantage and give us a very strong grip. However, oftentimes the tendons can become inflamed and the pulleys can become thickened. This is what is referred to as a trigger finger. The symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the"," 5

Explanation: The video does a good job of describing the benefits of each treatment. It explains that anti-inflammatory medications can help with the pain and decrease inflammation around the tendon, and that gentle stretching at home can help prevent the tendon from locking or triggering. It also mentions that a corticosteroid injection is effective at decreasing pain and eliminating a trigger finger, and that a small surgery is recommended if a corticosteroid injection does not work. The video also provides a link to a website where more information can be found.

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It mentions that the symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the fingers that is often associated with a nodule or a small bump that can be felt and it can oftentimes be associated with catching or locking of the finger. In very severe cases, this does require manual assistance to obtain full extension of the fingers. The video also mentions that if you suspect that you may be suffering from trigger finger, the first thing to do is begin taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve or ibuprofen. This will assist with the pain and will also decrease the inflammation around the tendon. You may also try gentle stretching at home, which would consist of locking the affected finger together and slowly stretching it out to try to stretch the tendon and prevent it from locking or triggering. If this does not work, it is advised to see your local hand surgeon, at which point you may receive a corticosteroid injection into the area of the pain at the base of the palm. A corticosteroid injection is extremely effective at decreasing the pain and oftentimes eliminating a trigger finger. If a corticosteroid injection does not work, a small surgery is"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that anti-inflammatory medications, gentle stretching, and corticosteroid injections can help relieve pain and inflammation, which can improve quality of life. It also mentions that surgery may be necessary if these treatments do not work, which can also improve quality of life by eliminating the trigger finger. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive description of how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, and therefore, I rate it a 5.

Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making because it provides information about the condition, symptoms, and treatment options. It also includes a link to a website where viewers can learn more about the condition and find a local hand surgeon. The video does not, however, provide any information about the risks or benefits of the different treatment options, which is an important aspect of shared decision-making. Therefore, I would rate the video as a 5, indicating that it provides support for shared decision-making, but could be improved by including more information about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.

The narrator is a medical expert and provides a good explanation of the condition. The video is a good resource for patients and healthcare professionals who want to learn more about trigger finger.
"," 5
Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty. The video states that the flexor tendons may swell, which causes rubbing and friction against the pulley each time the finger bends and extends. The video also states that the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. These statements indicate that there is uncertainty about the exact cause of trigger finger. The video also states that the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck. This statement indicates that there is uncertainty about the exact mechanism by which the finger triggers open. Overall, the video refers to areas of uncertainty, and I would rate it a 5 on the scale of 1 to 5.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. It explains that the condition is caused by swelling and thickening of the flexor tendons, which causes them to get stuck in the pulley. It also explains that the condition can be treated with surgery to release the pulley or with steroid injections to reduce inflammation and swelling. The video also explains that the condition can be prevented by avoiding activities that cause irritation to the flexor tendons, such as repetitive hand motions or activities that require gripping or grasping.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains the anatomy of the finger and how the flexor tendons work. It also explains how the pulleys hold the tendons in place and how they can become irritated and swollen. The video then explains how the tendons can become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley, which can cause triggering. The video also explains that the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley can get stuck once the finger has been flexed, and that with effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open. The video provides a clear and detailed explanation of the benefits of each treatment, and I rate it a 5.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes the risks of each treatment. It explains that the condition occurs when the flexor tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. It also explains that the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck, and that with effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open. This information is important for patients to know before deciding on a treatment plan.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. It explains that the flexor tendons would become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. It also explains that the finger would get stuck in a flexed position and would be difficult and painful to straighten out. The video does not mention any other possible outcomes, so it is clear that the only outcome described is what would happen if no treatment is used.
"," 5
Explanation: The video describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It explains that the treatment involves surgery to release the pulley, which allows the finger to move more freely. The video also mentions that the surgery is usually successful, but there is a risk of recurrence. The video does not mention any other treatment options, such as medications or physical therapy, which could also affect quality of life. However, the video does not provide any information on the effectiveness of these other treatment options, so it is difficult to say whether they would have a greater or lesser impact on quality of life than surgery. Overall, the video provides a good description of how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life.
