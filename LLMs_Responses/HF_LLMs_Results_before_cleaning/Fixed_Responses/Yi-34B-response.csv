Explanation: The video does describe the benefits of each treatment. The video explains that medication can turn off the production of urine by the kidneys, but it also notes that a certain percentage of children will still bed wet with the small amount of urine that the kidneys manage to produce despite the medication. The video also explains that a wetting alarm is a better solution because it is a behavioral modification and biofeedback system that allows the bladder and brain to talk to each other in the background at night. The video also explains that the success rate of wetting alarms is excellent, with 75% of children managing to respond to the alarm within three weeks. The video also explains that pull-ups are so good these days that kids don't mind being in them, and that taking them out of pull-ups and putting them in underwear can make them more interested in being dry at night."," 4
Explanation: The video does describe the risks of each treatment, but it does not do so in a comprehensive manner. The video mentions that medication can turn off the production of urine by the kidneys, which can lead to other health problems. However, it does not mention any other risks associated with medication. The video also mentions that wetting alarms can be effective, but it does not mention any risks associated with this treatment. Therefore, I would rate the video as a 4, meaning that it partially describes the risks of each treatment."," 5
Explanation: The video does describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The video states that bedwetting is not a disease and that kids eventually grow out of it. The video also states that the success rate of wetting alarms is excellent."," 4
Explanation: The video does not describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video mentions that the wetting alarm is a better solution than medication, but it does not explain how the wetting alarm affects the child's overall quality of life. The video also mentions that the child should be encouraged and assured that bedwetting will stop spontaneously, but it does not explain how this affects the child's overall quality of life."," 5
Explanation: The video is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice. The video mentions two common ways to treat bedwetting: medication and wetness alarm. The video also mentions that the success rate of wetting alarms is excellent. The video also mentions that the one other factor that has really made a big difference today is that pull-ups are so good these days, and they're so dry, that the kids don't mind being in them. So back off, or if you really want your child to be irritated by it, take them out of pull-ups, put them in underwear, and make them responsible to A, to do their laundry, B, to change the sheets, and then it will aggravate them, and maybe they'll be more interested in being dry at night."," 5
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making by presenting two treatment options for bedwetting and explaining the pros and cons of each. The video also provides statistics on the success rate of wetting alarms and offers advice on how to encourage children to use them.

Explanation: The video clearly states that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for bedwetting. The video mentions that primary bedwetting occurs when young children lack bladder control from infancy, while secondary bedwetting occurs when a child or adolescent has maintained proper control over their bladder during the night for at least six months or more and then begins to wet the bed again. The video also mentions that children who are more vulnerable to secondary bedwetting are ones who typically took a little bit longer to achieve night time continence in the first place. This suggests that there may be different treatment options for different types of bedwetting, and that the treatment may depend on the underlying cause. Therefore, I would rate the video as a 5, meaning that it is clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice."," 1

Explanation: The video describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The speaker explains that in the old days, they just took care of the problem after birth and protected the spinal cord, closed up the skin so that children would not get infected. They never had the expectation that it would improve their paralysis. They just assumed that paralysis was part of the problem of spina bifida. The speaker also explains that they started to learn through the advent of ultrasound and by doing some studies in mice and things like that, that it appeared that the spinal cord, even though it was exposed was normal when it was formed. And it just seemed to lose function during gestation, that it was the trauma in utero. The exposure to amniotic fluid, just bumping up against the uterine wall that actually damaged the spinal cord.

One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue.

Explanation: The video provides details of additional sources of support and information. The speaker mentions that parents should understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. The speaker also mentions that it's important to have a pediatric neurosurgeon place a shunt tube to treat the symptom of hydrocephalus. The speaker also mentions that it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt for life and to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. The speaker also mentions that it's important to have an orthopedic intervention after birth to treat club feet or telopes. The speaker also mentions that it's a lifelong issue of disability."," 5

The video also mentions that it's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made."," 5
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. The video explains that the shunt is a simple device made out of silicone that goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It also explains that the shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life.

The video also provides information about the different types of support and information that is available at the center."," 5
Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty by stating that the neural tube doesn't close completely, leaving a small gap. The video also mentions that the spinal canal remains open, and the spinal cord and meninges protrude from the baby's back. The video also mentions that the baby's spine and defect are exposed, and the defect is repaired and the skin of the baby's back is closed over the opening to protect their still-developing neural tissue. The video also mentions that the baby will be delivered via c-section following open surgery, and the baby can be delivered vaginally following fetoscopic surgery. The video also mentions that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation, and that the experts have spent years researching, innovating, and performing repairs of spina bifida."," 5
Explanation: The video clearly describes how each treatment works. The video explains that open surgery involves making incisions in the abdomen to open the mother's belly and uterus, exposing the baby's spine and defect, and then repairing the defect and closing the skin of the baby's back. The video also explains that fetoscopic surgery involves making tiny incisions and inserting instruments to access the baby and repair the defect. The video also explains that following open surgery, the baby will be delivered via c-section, while following fetoscopic surgery, the baby can be delivered vaginally."," 5
Explanation: The video clearly describes the benefits of each treatment. It explains that open surgery is performed under anesthesia and that the baby's spine and defect are exposed before the defect is repaired and the skin of the baby's back is closed over the opening to protect their still-developing neural tissue. It also explains that following open surgery, the baby will be delivered via c-section. The video also explains that fetoscopic surgery involves opening up the mother's belly like during the open surgery, but instead of cutting into the uterus, tiny incisions are made and instruments are inserted to access the baby and repair the defect. It also explains that following fetoscopic surgery, the baby can be delivered vaginally. The video also explains that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation and that the experts have spent years researching, innovating and performing repairs of spina bifida."," 5
Explanation: The video clearly describes the risks of each treatment. It explains that open surgery involves putting the mother to sleep, which can be risky, and that the baby will be delivered via c-section. It also explains that fetoscopic surgery involves making tiny incisions, which can be less risky, but that the baby may still need to be delivered vaginally. The video also explains that the Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation, which suggests that the treatments are safe and effective."," 5
Explanation: The video clearly describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The video explains that open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect the spine and spinal cord. It also explains that MMC and Myeloschisis are both serious forms of spina bifida and occur when a baby’s spine, spinal cord and spinal canal don’t close as they normally would. The video goes on to explain that spina bifida occurs in the first three to four weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when the spinal cord is forming. At this point, a baby’s developing brain and spine are referred to as the “neural tube.” Normally, during these first few weeks of development, the two sides of a baby's back fold to form a tube called the spinal cord. If a baby has an open neural tube defect, the neural tube doesn’t close completely, leaving a small gap. This is the defect. The video then explains that with an open neural tube defect such as MMC, the bones of the spine don’t completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. Because the spinal canal remains open, the spinal cord and meninges protrude"," 1
Explanation: The video does not describe how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The video only describes the types of spina bifida and the surgical procedures used to repair them. It does not discuss the potential long-term effects of the treatments or how they might impact the overall quality of life for the patient.

This gave researchers an idea. There's a rare headache syndrome called cluster headache. It has been described as one of the worst pains humans experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It's nicknamed the ""suicide headache"" because patients often consider taking or have taken their lives over it. It's thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to botox to surgery.

The video also mentions the procedure's duration, side effects, and effectiveness in relieving the pain of cluster headaches."," 5
Explanation: The video clearly states that the hypothalamus in the brain becomes dysfunctional, causing signals to be sent into the SPG, which then causes dilation and activates pain receptors. The video also mentions that the SPG has long been a treatment target and that there is a new option for cluster headache patients, the Pulsante SPG Microstimulator. The video explains that the microstimulator is inserted during a minimally invasive oral procedure and that the procedure lasts about an hour under general anesthesia. The video also states that the microstimulator is about the size of a penny and that most patients cannot even feel it or see it. The video also mentions that the remote controller communicates with the Pulsante microstimulator to provide immediate therapy by directing mild electrical pulses to the SPG to interfere with signals, interrupting the cluster headache pain loop, effectively flipping the switch on the fuse box, turning off the headache. The video also states that there is no cure for cluster headaches, but Pulsante therapy can stop the pain, allowing patients to return to the things they once enjoyed and reset the clock on cluster headache."," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty by mentioning that trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. The video also mentions that we'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it."," 5
Explanation: The video does a good job of describing how each treatment works. The surgeon explains that trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure they're ultimately going to incise. The surgeon then demonstrates how they do this by making an incision in the skin, doing some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath, and then using scissors to cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. They then lift up on one of the tendons to make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. They also check the flexor digitorum profunda tendon to make sure that it bends all of the joints of the finger. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, they mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. They then wash the wound out,"," 5
Explanation: The video does describe the benefits of each treatment. The video explains that trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. The video also explains that we'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and"," 5

The video explains that trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. The video also explains that there are two tendons in each finger, the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger, and the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. The video also explains that we can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. The video also explains that we'll wash the wound out, let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand, and then we'll close the wound. The video also explains that we'll place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger"," 5

Explanation: The video refers to areas of uncertainty by mentioning that triggering usually occurs at the A1 pulley, but that it can also occur at other pulleys. The video also mentions that the exact cause of trigger finger is not known, but that it is thought to be related to inflammation of the flexor tendons."," 5
Explanation: The video describes how each treatment works. The video explains that trigger finger is a condition in which a finger locks up or gets stuck in a flexed position. It can be difficult and painful to straighten out the finger. When it does straighten out, it snaps open or triggers. The video then goes on to explain the anatomy of the finger, including the two tendons that travel up the bones of the fingers and the pulleys that hold the flexor tendons in place. The video then explains that triggering usually occurs at the A1 pulley, or the first annular pulley. If something irritates the flexor tendons, they may swell. This causes rubbing and friction against the pulley each time the finger bends and extends. The irritation worsens and the tendons thicken. Over time, the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. Once the finger has been flexed, the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck. With effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open.

The video goes on to explain that in order to understand why this occurs, it is important to understand a little bit about the anatomy of the finger. Two tendons travel up the bones of the fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus attaches to the bone at the tip of the finger, known as the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum superficialis, which sits just on top, attaches to the middle phalanx. As muscles in the forearm contract, they pull on these tendons, which in turn pull on the bones of the finger. This bends, or flexes, the finger. Without anything holding the tendons up against the bones, they would bowstring as the muscles contracted, and so there are small ligamentous structures, known as pulleys, that hold the flexor tendons in place as they travel down the bones of the fingers"," 5

The video explains that there are two tendons that travel up the bones of the fingers, and that there are small ligamentous structures, known as pulleys, that hold the flexor tendons in place as they travel down the bones of the fingers. The video also explains that if something irritates the flexor tendons, they may swell, and that over time, the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. The video then explains that once the finger has been flexed, the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck, and that with effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open."," 5
Explanation: The video provides support for shared decision-making by explaining the anatomy of the finger and the causes of trigger finger. It also explains the treatment options available, including surgery, and the risks and benefits of each option. The video also provides information on how to prevent trigger finger.",Yes

The surgeon then places a drill guide through a slot in the plate, which will allow the surgeon to compress the plate with a screw into a secure and accurate position. The surgeon then proceeds to use the drill guide towers for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the remaining screws, to secure the plate into its final locked position against the heel bone. The surgeon then repairs the L-shaped incision with great care. The Calcania step plate was designed with a low profile so the patient should not feel any screws or hardware that have been secured into the bone. It can also be used in pediatric populations."," 5

Explanation: The video does describe what would happen if no treatment is used. The speaker explains that if you have flat feet, your Achilles tendon when seen from behind is probably going to be angled inward, and in this exercise, we're training your ability to roll your ankle out, moving that Achilles tendon from that inward pointing position to an outward pointing position. The speaker also explains that if you're only able to roll your ankle out to get your Achilles tendon to be vertical, without changing the rest of your foot, then you've got this big toe mound that's off the floor, and that's not a very stable foot either. The speaker then explains that the third key point is to keep your toes relatively relaxed compared to what the rest of your foot is doing, because if your toes are stuck in this death grip mode, then, when you raise your heel off the floor, you're not gonna be able to keep your big toe mound pushing into the floor. The speaker then explains that if you're having trouble performing this exercise exactly the way that I'm showing it to you, then feel free to modify this exercise.

Explanation: The video does describe how the treatment works. The video explains that the surgery involves making a cut on the side of the ankle, creating a bone tunnel in the calcaneus, and inserting a Swiveloc suture anchor loaded with fiber tape. The FDL tendon is identified, cut, and tagged with a fiber loop stitching technique. A bone tunnel is made in the navicular to prepare for an additional Swiveloc anchor. The ankle structures are tensioned and fixed into place by taking one part of the fiber tape and passing it from top to bottom with a suture passing wire. The remaining sutures are cut. The supporting structures of the arch of the foot are now repaired and held together with the internal brace, causing the arch of the foot to be restored."," 5
Explanation: The video does describe the benefits of each treatment. The video explains that the Arthrex internal brace spring ligament augmentation repair is a surgery for people who have flat foot due to weakness or rupture of the spring ligament or posterior tibial tendon. The repair begins with the surgeon making a cut on the side of the ankle where the calcaneus, vicular bone, and medial cuneiform are located. Next, the surgeon will create a bone tunnel by drilling into the sesentaculum tali of the calcaneus using a guide wire and drill guide. The bone tunnel is made in the calcaneus to prepare for a Swiveloc suture anchor loaded with fiber tape. The Swiveloc anchor is screwed into place. Next, the FDL tendon, also known as flexor digitorum longus, located on the medial side of the leg is identified, cut, and then tagged with a fiber loop stitching technique.

Explanation: The video clearly describes what would happen if no treatment is used. The speaker explains that pudendal nerve entrapment is an underdiagnosed condition in clinical practice that causes mainly perineal pain and sexual dysfunction, but also urinary and rectal symptoms. The speaker also explains that historically, and after failure of the conservative management, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes. The speaker then goes on to explain that the non-criteria which were put to standardize the diagnosis were very selective in order to minimize overtreatment by such an invasive approach. The speaker then explains that this was until the advent of laparoscopic pudendal release which allowed a minimally invasive surgery with an easy access and gentle blood-free dissection. The speaker then goes on to explain that this has therefore led to widening of surgical indications.
