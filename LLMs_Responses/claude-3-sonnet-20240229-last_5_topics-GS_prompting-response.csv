t6PP67AsJaI,"Fetal surgery for spina bifida is an incredibly complex procedure. At Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the surgery was developed, a team of more than 20 people are in the operating room. They include up to four fetal surgeons, one neurosurgeon, two anesthesiologists, a maternal fetal medicine specialist, a fetal cardiologist and specialized nurses. They have performed this procedure more than any team in the world. Before surgery, the mother receives deep general anesthesia. Fetal surgeons make an incision across the mother's abdomen. The maternal fetal medicine specialist uses ultrasound to determine the position of the fetus and the margins of the placenta. The uterus is then opened with a specially designed uterine stapling device that controls bleeding, and the fetus is positioned so the spinal defect is visible. The fetal cardiologist monitors the baby's heart as the team closes the defect. The neurosurgeon removes a sac on the baby's back that covers the opening in the spinal cord. The sac is a thin membrane filled with fluid. The neurosurgeon and the fetal surgeon then close the defect in multiple layers using a lacing technique. First the muscle layers are closed over the defect. Then the skin is closed over the muscle layers. This ensures a watertight closure. The mother's uterus is closed in multiple layers, then her abdomen is closed and she is returned to her room. The pregnancy then continues until planned delivery at 37 weeks' gestation, most often in our Special Delivery Unit created for moms carrying babies with birth defects. ♪♪",Spina Bifida,3,4,5,2,1,4,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1," 3

TuLAGDTpR6Y,"My name is Robin Bowman. I'm the director of Lurie Children's Multidisciplinary Spina Bifida Center and a fetal neurosurgeon with the Chicago Institute for Fetal Health, one of the few comprehensive fetal Care centers in the country. Approximately 1,500 babies are born each year in the United States with open spina bifida. In many cases, our experienced team can repair this birth defect while the baby is in the womb. This video demonstrates our minimally invasive fetoscopic repair for open spina bifida. This technique is designed to reduce the risk for mother and baby undergoing fetal surgery while preserving the option of vaginal delivery. Babies with open spina bifida who underwent back closure before birth have been shown to have long-term and improvement in their leg function, less of a need for hydrocephalus treatment, and improvement in the imaging of their brain. Open spina bifida occurs when the bones of a baby's back do not close properly. The baby's spinal cord extends through the open bones and attaches to the skin. This birth defect most often occurs in the baby's lower back region. Open spina bifida also has an impact on the developing brain. Babies with open spina bifida may develop an excess of spinal fluid known as hydrocephalus. The back part of their brain may also sink down into the neck. And this is known as hindbrain herniation. Fetal closure of the exposed spinal cord has been shown to help improve the hindbrain herniation and decrease the development of excessive brain water. The repair of an open spina bifida is done before 26 weeks gestation. Let's walk through this procedure. Once the mother is prepared for surgery and under anesthesia, we create an incision on her abdomen. A transverse or horizontal incision is made across the lower abdomen. In some cases a midline incision is made. The abdominal muscles are then opened in the midline. The abdominal cavity is entered. And the uterus is exposed. Intraoperative ultrasound is used to precisely identify the position of the baby in the placenta, which helps us plan our entry points while watching with the ultrasound. The initial port is inserted into the uterus. Warm, humidified carbon dioxide is then infused into the uterine cavity to expand our working field. We then insert a camera through the port and watch on the viewing screen as two additional 3 millimeter ports are inserted into the uterus. After all, three ports are inserted, the fetus is anesthetized and the back closure begins. We begin by releasing the spinal cord from the surrounding tissues. This allows the cord to relax back within the canal. We then close the spinal cord with a few stitches. Our attention is then turned to the dura or the tough membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, which holds in the spinal fluid. The dura is freed circumferential and closed in a watertight fashion. Lastly, the skin is undermined, enclosed in the midline. Occasionally, the defect is too large to allow primary skin closure. In this situation, a patch is used to close the skin opening. The fetal repair portion of the procedure is now complete. To further protect the baby for the duration of pregnancy, warm fluid and antibiotics are placed within the uterine cavity. All ports are removed, and the incisions are sutured closed. The mother's abdominal wall and skin are closed. The fetus continues to develop and heal for the duration of the pregnancy. During this time, the hindbrain herniation may also correct itself as the cerebellum will likely move back into place. Ideally, the pregnancy continues to full-term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally and cared for by our expert team of specialists. The Chicago Institute for Fetal Health and Lurie Children's Hospital is home to one of the oldest and largest multidisciplinary spina bifida centers in the world. This spina bifida team is comprised of a variety of surgical, medical, and rehabilitation experts, who are focused on assisting each child with open spina bifida reach and maintain their highest developmental potential. The Chicago Institute for Fetal Health Team will insure you and your baby's care is individualized and thorough throughout your child's life.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,4,1,4,1,1,3,4,2,1,2,2,2," 5

The transcript provides some details on how the fetal surgery treatment works to repair open spina bifida, but does not describe the mechanisms of action for other potential treatments mentioned like hydrocephalus treatment or rehabilitation.

Specifically, it explains that the fetal surgery involves closing the exposed spinal cord, dura (membrane covering the brain/spinal cord), and skin over the defect. It notes this can help reduce hindbrain herniation and excessive fluid buildup in the brain. However, it does not go into detail on how other referenced treatments like shunts for hydrocephalus or physical/occupational therapy work to achieve their effects.

The focus is primarily on the medical procedure and the expertise of their team, rather than actively promoting shared decision-making with a broader support network.",set()
4xOGmPla7e0,"... Hi, my name is Jason Hsu, and I am an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Keck School of Medicine here at USC. I'm also a pediatric neurosurgeon that works at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and I'm excited to talk to you a little bit about some of our ongoing work and our experience with fetal surgery for myelomeningocele. So myelomeningocele is a central nervous system malformation that occurs extremely early in life, and it results from a failure of primary neuralation where the caudal neural port fails to go from a sheet and roll over it to form a tube. The resultant malformation not only affects the spinal cord, but also the nerves, the bones, the muscles, and the skin in the back. There are also secondary effects that can occur in the brain as a result of this malformation lower down in the spinal cord. And in this picture, we can see our myelomeningocele in this newborn baby, but what's not immediately obvious in this picture is the other malformations that can occur within the brain, weakness in the legs or paralysis in the legs, bladder dysfunction, scoliosis, as well as symptomatic hydrocephalus. The traditional way that a myelomeningocele is treated is to repair it after the babies are born. However, a lot of work done in the 90s had looked for ways to repair the myelomeningocele lesion prenatally. And the researchers had shown that prenatal repair was effective in protecting the existing neural elements from continued injury in utero, as well as preventing spinal fluid leak from the myelomeningocele itself with a secondary effect of restoration of more normal CSF hydrodynamics. All of this work had resulted in a large randomized control trial that was published approximately 10 years ago. This trial is called the Management of Myelomeningocele, or MOMS trial, and the investigators had found improvements in rates of symptomatic hydrocephalus that required treatment, as well as improved motor outcomes in a number of the patients that were repaired prenatally. The benefits to the infants, however, did not come without risks. And there was noted to be very significant maternal morbidity related to prenatal repair, including severe complications such as placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, resulting in prematurity within many of the babies born, as well as a need for a C-section for the current pregnancy, as well as any future pregnancies. This is a picture of how the MOMS trial investigators had completed the prenatal repair. And what some of the maternal morbidity came about from was not only was a laparotomy required, but a hysterotomy was also required where the uterus is open in order to gain access to the myelomeningocele lesion. Despite the maternal risks, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has gained traction worldwide. Several centers within the United States have started fetal programs for myelomeningocele. In addition, several of these programs have attempted to refine the procedure so that there's less maternal risk and less trauma to the uterus. This is a technique that's described by Dr. Belfort and Dr. Whitehead at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Another technique had involved a hybrid approach where the uterus was externalized, however, the procedure was completed in a minimally invasive fashion where laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments were placed within the uterus in order to complete the myelomeningocele closure. Additionally, other groups, mainly actually in Europe as well as South America, have attempted to complete the myelomeningocele repair through a purely percutaneous approach involving the placement of the laparoscopes and working channels and laparoscopic instruments in a minimally invasive fashion through the skin. While this minimally invasive approach has mainly been done outside of the United States, here at USC we've collaborated with a group in Miami to try and bring this technique here. To date, USC and CHLA is currently only one of two centers in the United States to offer this percutaneous, fetoscopic repair for myelomeningocele. We are currently conducting a phase one study to evaluate its safety, and our goal is to try and achieve similar outcomes for our infants as the MOMS trial while improving maternal outcomes. This is a picture of our team, and as you can see, it's a very multidisciplinary team that not only involves fetal surgeons, OBGYNs, neurosurgeons, but also spina bifida, pediatricians, radiology as well as neonatologists. As you can see, it really takes a village to try and complete this work. We've done our first case in February of 2019, and as of October 2020, we've done 28 cases of 27 patients split between here and our collaborators over in Miami. This is a video of one of our cases, and here we have introduced our laparoscopes and laparoscopic instruments. You can see the neuroplakode from before, and using laparoscopic scissors, we're able to carefully dissect out the neuroplakode and preserve any neural elements. After separating out the neuroplakode and the malformed spine from some of the surrounding tissue, you can see it pops down into a more normal position within the spinal cord. And once that's complete, we proceed with closure, and we try to do a multilayer closure to provide as much coverage and protection to the spinal cord as possible. So here, what we're doing is we're elevating and raising some of the muscles beside the spine to provide an extra barrier called the myofascial flap. This is a piece of dura repair, which we're using to reconstruct the fecal sac, and the myofascial flap is closed over top of this. Here you can see the myofascial flap is completed with complete coverage of our monomaniacal lesion. And you can see this, the skin is closed with a running suture. Here are some of our early results. In comparison to the MOMS trial, thus far we've had very similar gestational ages at delivery. One thing that's immediately apparent is the lower rate for cesarean section, and the other 13 patients were actually delivered vaginally, which was something that was not seen in the MOMS trial. We're still calculating our maternal risks, but thus far they've been comparable to what was seen in the MOMS trial. In terms of our infant results, we've seen very similar results in the MOMS trial as well. Of course, more data analysis is needed. However, what we've experienced is that we have had pretty comparable rates for the need for hydrocephalus treatment, as well as those improvements in motor outcomes. So in summary, fetal surgery for myelomeningocele has become an increasingly popular treatment modality worldwide. The results of the MOMS trial had demonstrated improved infant outcomes in terms of symptomatic hydrocephalus, as well as motor outcomes. However, this did come with risks to MOM. Currently, in the United States, USC is undergoing a phase one trial as a collaborative work that's assessing the safety and feasibility of fetoscopic surgery in the United States. And our early data thus far has been very encouraging. Thanks for watching. And this picture here is a picture of our first patient. And that patient is doing extremely well. They have not required treatment for hydrocephalus and are able to ambulate independently. And this is another picture of a patient here who's approximately six months old and has been doing quite well.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,4,3,4,1,3,2,3,2,1,3,4,3," 5

The transcript partially discusses areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for myelomeningocele. While it does not explicitly mention uncertainties or differences in expert opinion, it presents the traditional treatment approach of repairing the condition after birth and the newer prenatal surgical approach as two different treatment options. The transcript goes into detail about the potential benefits and risks associated with the prenatal surgical approach, as studied in the MOMS trial. However, it does not directly compare the two approaches or delve into the factors that may influence the choice between them. The discussion is focused more on the technical aspects of the prenatal surgical procedure being developed at USC, rather than weighing the uncertainties or trade-offs between the treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how the prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele works in protecting the spinal cord and neural elements from continued injury and preventing spinal fluid leaks. However, it does not go into specific details about the mechanisms by which these effects are achieved or how the treatments act on the body at a physiological level. The descriptions focus more on the outcomes and high-level goals of the treatments rather than the underlying biological processes. Therefore, I would rate this as a partial description of how the treatments work, hence a score of 2."," 3

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments for myelomeningocele (spina bifida). It mentions the following benefits:

1. Prenatal repair can protect existing neural elements from continued injury in utero and prevent spinal fluid leakage, resulting in more normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.

2. The MOMS trial found improvements in rates of symptomatic hydrocephalus requiring treatment and improved motor outcomes in infants who underwent prenatal repair compared to postnatal repair.

3. The minimally invasive fetoscopic approach being studied at USC aims to achieve similar benefits for infants as the MOMS trial (improved hydrocephalus rates and motor outcomes) while reducing maternal risks.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits of postnatal repair, which is presented as the traditional approach. It focuses more on the potential benefits of prenatal repair approaches."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments for myelomeningocele. It mentions the significant maternal morbidity and risks associated with the traditional open fetal surgery approach used in the MOMS trial, including placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, prematurity, and the need for cesarean section. However, it does not explicitly describe the potential risks or side effects of the minimally invasive fetoscopic repair technique that is the focus of the current study at USC. While it states that their goal is to achieve similar infant outcomes as the MOMS trial while improving maternal outcomes, it does not detail what risks or complications may still exist with this newer approach. Therefore, it only partially covers the risks for the different treatment options."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not explicitly describe the risks or benefits of not treating fetal myelomeningocele (postponing treatment, watchful waiting, or permanently forgoing treatment). The focus is on describing the condition itself, the traditional postnatal treatment approach, the prenatal surgical treatment approach evaluated in the MOMS trial, potential maternal risks of the prenatal surgery, and the minimally invasive fetoscopic prenatal surgery technique being studied at USC. While it mentions benefits of prenatal surgery compared to postnatal repair, it does not discuss what would happen if no treatment (prenatal or postnatal) is provided."," 3

The transcript provides some information about how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but the details are limited and not very specific.

It mentions that the prenatal repair of myelomeningocele was shown to result in ""improved motor outcomes"" in infants compared to the traditional postnatal repair. This implies potential benefits to quality of life related to improved mobility and physical functioning.

However, the transcript does not go into much detail describing the actual effects on day-to-day activities or overall quality of life measures. It focuses more on the clinical outcomes like need for hydrocephalus treatment and mobility rather than explicitly addressing impacts on quality of life.

There are brief references to infants being able to ambulate independently after prenatal repair, which suggests improved physical capabilities affecting quality of life. But overall, the information provided about quality of life impacts is limited compared to the technical details about the procedures themselves.

So while it partially addresses potential quality of life"," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for myelomeningocele. While the primary focus is on the fetoscopic surgery approach, the transcript also mentions the traditional postnatal repair approach and briefly compares the fetoscopic approach to the open fetal surgery approach used in the MOMS trial. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive discussion of who may benefit most from each approach and under what specific circumstances one approach may be preferred over another. The information provided is somewhat incomplete in terms of fully laying out the different treatment options and the factors that would guide the choice between them."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The video primarily focuses on explaining the medical condition of myelomeningocele, the traditional treatment approach, and the new minimally invasive fetal surgery technique being studied at USC. While it mentions the risks and benefits of the fetal surgery, it does not directly encourage patients or families to discuss these options with their healthcare team or others. The video is more informative than prescriptive in terms of shared decision-making.",set()
N_MaRhpBo6A,"It's important to understand that not all families want to have fetal surgery because of the requirements and the commitments and the risks that are involved. Families may come to us, undergo the diagnostic testing, and the defect may not be a defect that is included in the criteria for the surgery. Even if a family is an ideal surgery candidate, this may not be the best thing for them. And it is our obligation to help them understand that that's alright, that that's okay, that that's their choice, that that is the right choice for them. For families that want the traditional approach of having surgery after birth but still want to deliver at our center because of our multidisciplinary experience and care, we follow them as well. We generally have them come back at monthly intervals so we can monitor growth and development of the baby to look for progression in the hydrocephaly and all the markers of complications. We generally deliver them at around 37 weeks. The mother usually has a cesarean section in the special delivery unit. Our goal is to deliver the baby without any additional trauma to the myelomeningocele sac and also not to rupture the sac but to deliver the myelomeningocele intact. The baby then is evaluated by a neonatal resuscitation team. We have special equipment ready so that we can do different positions knowing that that spinal cord is still exposed. The baby then goes to the NICU where all the multiple subspecialties come and evaluate the baby. Neurosurgery generally take the baby to the operating room within the first 24 to 48 hours of life and do the neurosurgical repair. The technical aspects are pretty much the same whether I do it prenatally or postnatally. I have the same layers, I do essentially the same operation. The beauty of our facility is that we have our own delivery suite right here in the children's hospital so mother and baby are in the same place. So mother delivers, we get to look at the baby, we close the back the next day, I can talk to the mother about how things went and she can hold the baby the next day.",Spina Bifida,2,4,4,2,1,4,1,3,2,1,2,1,1,5,3," 2

The transcript partially indicates the aims of the video. It discusses the process and considerations for prenatal and postnatal treatment of spina bifida, including fetal surgery and traditional postnatal surgery. However, the overall purpose or main aim of the video is not explicitly stated. The transcript covers various aspects of the treatment process but does not clearly outline the central goal or objective of the video itself."," 4

The transcript provides a good overview of the procedures and care involved for families who choose either the fetal surgery or traditional postnatal surgical approach for treating myelomeningocele. It covers the initial evaluation process, monitoring during pregnancy, delivery procedures, neonatal care, and surgical repair after birth.

However, the aims or goals of the video are not explicitly stated, making it difficult to fully assess if all intended information has been covered. The transcript seems to be focused on describing the clinical processes and multidisciplinary care rather than achieving specific educational aims.

Overall, the information provided is quite comprehensive for families considering these treatment options, but without knowing the precise aims, it's unclear if any key aspects were missed. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially) seems appropriate based on the level of detail and relevance of the information conveyed."," 4

The transcript is partially relevant in addressing questions readers might have about fetal surgery for spina bifida or other birth defects. It provides useful information about the decision-making process for families considering fetal surgery, the criteria for eligibility, and the alternative option of postnatal surgery.

The transcript makes it very clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. The expert describes two main treatment options:

1. Fetal surgery: This option is presented as suitable for families who meet certain criteria and are willing to undergo the requirements, commitments, and risks involved.

2. Traditional approach of having surgery after birth: This option is described as appropriate for families who do not want fetal surgery or do not meet the criteria for it. These families can still deliver at the center and receive multidisciplinary care, with the baby undergoing surgery within the first 24-48 hours of life.

The expert explicitly states that even if a family is an ""ideal surgery candidate,"" fetal surgery ""may not be the best thing for them,"" and it is their choice to make.

LHwQeNHc0TE,"We of course had the life plan, you know, pay off the student loans, house with the backyard, travel a bit, kids. Had a pretty good pregnancy the first 16 weeks and then they called us and said that the protein in the blood was elevated which is abnormal and that led us to eventually getting Jack's diagnosis and everything changed in that moment. Myelomeningocele is a birth defect that children have that about 80% of them or so are going to, in addition to having the issues associated with the spinal cord defect, will also develop hydrocephalus. The issue of hydrocephalus or water on the brain which is a lifetime problem, is a problem that requires management when it develops. It requires often multiple surgeries over a lifetime. The prenatal surgery eliminates that for a significant percentage of children. These kids are not coming back to the hospital as frequently with issues related to their hydrocephalus because they simply don't have it. The morning of the surgery we got up and I remember feeling fairly calm. I think that I was pretty comfortable and knew what to expect and we had met with everyone enough that I knew what the procedure was going to be and knew how it was going to go. I knew that they were going to stay in touch with Kevin. Remember they came in and they were ready to take me and they asked, do you want to walk in or do you want to go in a wheelchair? And I was like, I can still walk in. I want to walk in. Like, let's do this. I remember you walking away down that hallway. This isn't a neurosurgery program. This isn't an MFM program. This is a fetal care program. So the fetal care program is a multidisciplinary group that includes all the specialists that would interact with mom's care. To have a program where you can offer complex fetal surgery, it requires the presence and the infrastructure of a strong overall collaborative program. The objective of surgery is to close the myelomeningocele with as little or no scar tissue as possible and to recreate the layers that should have normally formed. And so it's to close the placode or the neural tissue into a tube and to close the dura or the covering of the spinal cord as it should have normally formed. Ideally to pull in fascia or connective tissue as it normally would be there and then to have the skin covering so that they don't need to be treated for hydrocephalus. And then Dr. Goodnight came out after the procedure was done and gave us an update and said everything went well and you were up resting in the recovery room and that we'd be able to come and see you. You know, overall you were, you were a trooper. We were well cared for. We had a good team. Even to this day when I tell people about Jack's diagnosis and what that means, it's not until you meet him that you can see beyond the diagnosis. Hi buddy. Okay, are you ready? Yeah. Hi buddy. I've been fortunate enough to do this long enough now that I've watched people graduate from high school, get married, have families, have jobs. I joke with them when they come to my clinic that I'm going to schedule extra visits so that they can just come see me and visit me in clinic because I love hearing how they're doing and how they're developing and you know how they're doing in school and things forward. He gives you the sweetest looks and the biggest smiles all the time and he's just, he's a really good boy and he's very resilient. He's really the opposite of the picture that was painted for us when we got his diagnosis in December. Every doctor we met with in the UNC fetal surgery team, they were so patient and they just took the time to make sure that we were very comfortable. Their optimism and hope really gave us optimism and hope.",Spina Bifida,4,4,4,4,2,4,1,5,3,4,3,2,3,5,5," 4

The video transcript provides some indication of the aims or topic, but they are not very clearly stated upfront. The main aims seem to be:

1) To discuss the experience of having a child diagnosed with myelomeningocele (a birth defect involving the spinal cord) and undergoing fetal surgery to treat it.

2) To highlight the multidisciplinary fetal care program that made the surgery possible.

3) To show the positive outcomes and development of the child after the fetal surgery.

However, these aims are not explicitly laid out at the beginning. They have to be inferred from the personal story and details provided throughout the transcript. A clearer statement of the video's purposes upfront would have been helpful. But the overall topic and general aims do come through, albeit in a somewhat scattered way."," 4

1. A more detailed explanation of what myelomeningocele is and its potential complications beyond hydrocephalus.
2. Specific details about the surgical technique and the potential risks or complications of the prenatal surgery.
3. More information about the long-term prognosis and potential challenges faced by children who undergo this surgery.

Overall, while the transcript provides a good overview and personal account of the prenatal surgery experience, it does not fully cover all the potential information one might expect from a comprehensive description of the aims of the video."," 4

The video transcript is partially relevant to providing information about a medical condition and procedure. It covers the diagnosis of myelomeningocele (spina bifida) in a fetus, the decision to undergo fetal surgery, the surgical procedure itself, and the positive outcomes for the child after the surgery.

However, it does not provide comprehensive medical details about the condition, its causes, risk factors, or long-term prognosis. The transcript focuses more on the personal experience and journey of the parents, rather than providing in-depth medical information.

While the personal narrative is valuable in understanding the human aspect of the condition and treatment, readers seeking purely medical information may find some gaps. Nevertheless, the transcript does address the broad topic of myelomeningocele and fetal surgery in a relatable way, making it partially relevant to readers interested in this medical area."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript partially references some sources of information and evidence, but not consistently for all major claims or statements made.

There are a few instances where expert opinions or research studies are cited as sources:

1. ""Myelomeningocele is a birth defect that children have that about 80% of them or so are going to, in addition to having the issues associated with the spinal cord defect, will also develop hydrocephalus."" - This statistic likely comes from medical research on myelomeningocele, though no specific source is cited.

2. ""The prenatal surgery eliminates that for a significant percentage of children. These kids are not coming back to the hospital as frequently with issues related to their hydrocephalus because they simply don't have it."" - This appears to be referring to research or data on the efficacy of prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele, but again no"," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. However, it mentions that the events described in the video took place during the pregnancy and after the birth of a child named Jack. Therefore, I can infer that the video itself is relatively recent, but there are no specific dates given for when it was produced or when the events took place. The lack of dates for the sources of information used makes it difficult to determine how current or relevant the information presented in the video is."," 4

Explanation:

The video transcript appears to be largely balanced and unbiased, presenting information from multiple perspectives and sources. It includes personal accounts from the parents, as well as insights from medical professionals involved in the fetal surgery program. The video covers both the challenges and potential benefits of the prenatal surgery, acknowledging the risks and lifetime management required, while also highlighting the positive outcomes and improved quality of life for some children.

However, there are a few elements that introduce some potential bias:

1. The personal accounts from the parents, while providing valuable insight, inherently introduce an emotional and subjective perspective.
2. The video primarily focuses on the advantages of the prenatal surgery for treating myelomeningocele, with limited discussion of alternative treatment options or their potential drawbacks.
3. The medical professionals featured in the video are from the same fetal surgery program, which could potentially introduce some institutional bias in favor of the procedure they perform."," 1

Explanation: Yes, the video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for the condition myelomeningocele. The transcript mentions that the prenatal surgery ""eliminates [the need for hydrocephalus treatment] for a significant percentage of children,"" implying that there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the surgery for some children. Additionally, the doctor states that ""the objective of surgery is to close the myelomeningocele with as little or no scar tissue as possible and to recreate the layers that should have normally formed,"" suggesting that the surgical outcome can vary. Furthermore, the parents' initial concerns and the doctor's reassurance indicate that there were uncertainties about the treatment and its potential risks and benefits, which were addressed through open communication and counseling."," 3

However, the description of how the treatment works is relatively brief and high-level. It does not go into significant detail about the specific mechanisms by which closing the myelomeningocele and recreating the proper anatomical layers prevents hydrocephalus or the other effects of the condition.

The transcript presents a personal account and experiences of mothers whose children underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida at the Mott Children's Hospital. While the overall tone is positive and focuses on the resilience of the children and the support provided by the hospital, there are a few aspects that suggest some bias:

1. The video primarily highlights the positive outcomes and experiences of the mothers, without providing a balanced perspective on potential challenges or negative experiences.

2. There is no reference to alternative treatment options or a broader discussion of spina bifida management. The focus is solely on the fetal surgery performed at Mott Children's Hospital.

3. The information is presented from a personal point of view, with testimonials from the mothers involved, rather than an objective, scientific or medical perspective.

4. While the video does not explicitly promote or endorse the Mott Children's Hospital"," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the local Mott hospital system where the families received treatment. The transcript focuses on personal stories and experiences of the families with children who underwent fetal surgery, but does not suggest further reading materials or mention any other organizations providing advice and information related to the medical conditions discussed."," 1

The transcript does not explicitly mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for the medical conditions discussed (spina bifida and fetal surgery). The moms share their positive experiences with the medical care received at Mott Children's Hospital and the resilience of their children, but there is no discussion of different expert opinions or uncertainties around treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how some of the treatments work, but does not provide details for all of the treatments mentioned. It discusses the fetal surgery and spinal surgery that some of the children underwent, but does not go into specifics about how these procedures act on the body to achieve their effects. The focus is more on the emotional journey and support system provided by connecting with other families who have gone through similar experiences. While the positive outcomes of the treatments are highlighted, there is a lack of technical details explaining the mechanisms behind how the treatments work."," 2 (Partially)

Explanation:
The transcript discusses the experiences and perspectives of mothers whose children underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida at the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. It highlights the positive outcomes and resilience of the children, as well as the supportive community formed among the mothers.

While the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits of specific treatments, it implies that the fetal surgery helped the children with spina bifida achieve positive outcomes, such as independence, strength, and resilience. However, it does not provide details on the benefits of the treatment or other treatments that may have been involved.

Therefore, I would give a score of 2 (Partially) because the transcript suggests benefits of at least one treatment (fetal surgery) but does not comprehensively describe the benefits of each treatment mentioned."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of treatments. It mentions that the doctors told the parents about ""the worst case scenarios,"" which implies that they discussed the potential risks and complications associated with the treatments or conditions. However, it does not provide specific details about what those risks are. The transcript focuses more on the positive outcomes and the support and community the parents found through their shared experiences. While the risks are alluded to, they are not explicitly described for any of the treatments mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any information about the risks or benefits of not pursuing treatment or adopting a ""watchful waiting"" approach for the medical condition being discussed (which seems to be spina bifida based on context clues). The transcript focuses on the positive experiences and outcomes of the mothers and children who received treatment at Mott Children's Hospital, but does not describe what could happen if no treatment was pursued."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any clear reference to the overall quality of life or the effects of treatment choices on day-to-day activities. The transcript primarily focuses on the experiences of mothers whose children underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida, and their appreciation for the care they received at Mott Children's Hospital. While there are mentions of the children's resilience and ability to perform activities independently, there is no explicit discussion of how the treatment choices (e.g., fetal surgery) affected their overall quality of life or day-to-day functioning compared to other treatment options."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any indication that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for the medical condition being discussed (which seems to be spina bifida based on the context). The transcript focuses on the positive experiences and outcomes of the mothers and their children who underwent fetal surgery at Mott Children's Hospital. While the mothers express gratitude for the care and support they received, there is no mention of alternative treatment options or suggestions to consider or investigate further before deciding on a particular treatment."," 2

The video provides some limited support for shared decision-making. It does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals. However, it indirectly implies the importance of seeking medical care and guidance from healthcare professionals at Mott Children's Hospital, where the families received treatment and support for their children's conditions.

The video highlights the positive experiences and outcomes of the families who underwent fetal surgery and received care at Mott Children's Hospital. The mothers express gratitude for the kindness, professionalism, and pivotal role of the healthcare team at Mott in their journey. They also emphasize the resilience and strength of their children, suggesting that they followed the medical advice and treatment provided by the healthcare professionals.

While the video does not directly encourage shared decision-making, it implies that the families trusted and relied on the expertise of the medical professionals at Mott Children's Hospital, which is an essential aspect of shared",set()
hwKXYIiUUmo,"I was going in for my ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby and they had found out one of my tests that came out positive, my blood test. So they sent me to a specialist, a terrible in general, to see exactly what was going on and then she found out the defect. So then they sent me here to find out more exactly about the defect. As part of prenatal testing you do what's called a quad screen and the quad screen actually will look to see if your baby is at risk for having a hole in the spine and it just so happens that her quad screen back is positive and it said, hey look closer at this baby's spine, there may be something going on with it. She just let us know that was a spinal defect and you know what can cause it and what we would be dealing with and then she told me that we would have to come here to really figure out you know exactly where it was and exactly what our outlook was. Spina bifida is a failure of the closure of the back, particularly of both the spine and the spinal cord to properly form in the first month after the baby is being developed. And when that happens it leads to a defect in the back and the spinal elements that actually stick out of the back often in a sac that can be nonfunctional and that can lead to problems with movement of the limbs below that level of impairment that can involve sensation impairment below the level. Use of the bowel or the bladder properly is difficult due to those and there's also an association with hydrocephalus or fluid in the brain that accumulates due to that abnormality. Back in 1997 was the first procedure where they actually were, where someone took the chance of saying let's open up the uterus, let's close this defect and let's see if we can't keep these outcomes from happening or can we make better outcomes. Between 1997 and 2003 there was about 200 of these cases done across the nation and people were saying hey we're getting better outcomes with these babies than we are if we left them alone. And there was a lot of debate about well is it really worth the risk to the maternal health, is it really worth the risk to the fetal health, this is a dangerous thing to do, some of the medicines you're doing are very dangerous for the pregnancy, is this really the right thing to do? And so what happened was back in 2003 the NIH supported a study what they called the MOMS trial. All the pediatric surgeons got together and said we are not going to offer this until we kind of get an idea if this makes a difference or not. And so that was actually published in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine and that's the study that really kind of got us fired up here is because it actually showed that there are better outcomes. We're able to make these babies do better with this in utero procedure and so me and Dr. Bui had got together and said listen this is something that we need to offer in the region. I think we have enough volume of these babies that we see in my clinic to make this technique that we can offer here at Oster. So we're able to actually have a window up in the uterus and then be able to bring just the babies back through. So once we're able to get to the defect then the night takeover and under high magnification we actually do the repair. The good thing about Oster is that we have pediatric neurosurgeons, we have a pediatric cardiologist, we have a high risk pregnancy doctor, we have high risk anesthesia. We've got everything that we need here. The team was well prepared and that gave me a lot of confidence that we would be able to pull it off without any problem. We've been fortunate so far none of those children as of yet have required a shunt to be placed for hydrocephalus. They're doing very well with their growth. They do still continue to have some bowel and bladder problems but they're very manageable and they have had less overall orthopedic and neurologic impairment because of the surgery than they likely would have otherwise had. I think it's definitely a landmark procedure for Oster but it's also a landmark procedure for the state. I think this is a first in the state if not the region. Currently there are less than 10 programs in the country and that's because it does require quite a bit of expertise. I think that this really does highlight what Oster does well which is to bring together a lot of high end specialists into one area. His name is Kobe Damian Boudreau. He weighed four pounds and twelve ounces when he was born and that's 17 inches and a half long. Pretty much after the surgery his outcome is pretty much good. He's moving his legs like he should and his ultrasound of his brain came out fine and his incision looks good. He's doing pretty good. So this doesn't look very dissimilar from just a normal baby without spina bifida at this point. That's good. Okay so I think that you know the at least right now I don't have any real concern for a shunt and as far as the back and whether there's any leakage or breakdown of the wound the back looks about as good as we can hope for. I think that's you know because the baby had all that time of year within the belly. You had the absolute best result that we could have a whole family. Very, very happy about it. Yeah so well we'd get them. Oster has always been on the forefront in a number of areas of trying to do things that are game changers, really make a difference for the patient and this is one of those instances where you really are making a difference for the patient and over the years there have been some of those in adults and some of those in children and this is one that is really going to be a great advance for children. Now that he's here and we've gone through everything I'm very, very happy that we went ahead and did it because his outcome does look a lot better than what it would have been if we didn't do the surgery so I'm very happy about that. You know the difference for a family having a wheelchair bound kid versus a kid that can you know that can walk that's what makes it worth it is the ability to really change one's kids whole entire life with an operation early on.",Spina Bifida,4,4,5,3,2,3,1,5,3,4,3,1,5,5,4," 4

The video transcript provides a fairly clear indication of its aims, which appear to be explaining what spina bifida is, describing a fetal surgery procedure to repair spina bifida defects before birth, and highlighting the benefits and importance of this procedure based on a specific patient case.

However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront in a concise manner. Rather, the details about the aims are spread out and interwoven throughout the lengthy transcript, requiring the viewer to piece together the overall context and purpose.

So while the general aims are conveyed through the content, they could have been made clearer and more direct from the outset. A more explicit statement of the video's goals at the beginning would have improved the clarity further."," 4

The video transcript provides detailed information about spina bifida, the in-utero surgery to repair it, and the specific case being discussed. It covers the background on spina bifida, the history and clinical trial that established the in-utero repair surgery, the multi-disciplinary team involved, the surgical procedure itself, and the positive outcomes for the baby featured in the case.

However, there are a few gaps in fully achieving the stated aims of providing a description of spina bifida and the in-utero repair surgery:

1. It does not go into much detail on the potential risks, complications or limitations of the surgery.

2. It does not provide much context on the prevalence or causes of spina bifida.

3. It focuses primarily on this one successful case rather than discussing the overall success rates and long-term outcomes across many cases.

So while it covers the core information thoroughly, there are some peripheral details missing"," 5

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant and provides detailed information about spina bifida, a birth defect involving the improper formation of the spine and spinal cord. It explains what spina bifida is, how it is detected during prenatal testing, the potential complications it can cause, and a groundbreaking surgical procedure called the ""fetal surgery for spina bifida"" that can be performed in utero to improve outcomes for the baby. The transcript includes insights from medical experts, including surgeons and specialists involved in performing the procedure, as well as the perspective of a parent whose child underwent the surgery. Overall, the information covered is comprehensive and directly addresses questions readers might have about spina bifida and this innovative fetal surgery."," 3

The transcript provides some references to sources of information, but not consistently for all major claims or statements. Specifically:

- It mentions the ""MOMS trial"" published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2011 as providing evidence for better outcomes with the in utero surgery for spina bifida.

- It states there are currently less than 10 programs in the country offering this procedure, indicating some awareness of the limited availability.

- The doctors/experts are quoted discussing the procedure, outcomes, and their rationale for offering it, lending some authority.

However, there are no specific references provided for some of the key background information, such as the details on what spina bifida is, the typical outcomes without surgery, the risks of the surgery, etc. These appear to be stated without attribution to a particular study or source.

So while some sources are cited, especially around the key clinical trial data, many of the factual"," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates related to the history and development of the fetal surgery procedure for spina bifida, but does not clearly cite dates for all the sources of information used to compile the video. Specifically, it mentions that the first fetal surgery for spina bifida was performed in 1997, and that between 1997 and 2003 about 200 cases were done across the nation. It also mentions that the MOMS trial was published in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, there are no clear dates provided for other sources of information, such as the specific medical literature or guidelines referred to in explaining the condition, risks, and outcomes. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that only some dates are provided for the acknowledged sources used in the video."," 3

Explanation:

The video transcript presents information about a specific medical procedure (in-utero surgery for spina bifida) from a personal perspective, focusing on the experiences of the parents and medical team involved in a particular case. While it provides details on the procedure itself and some background on the clinical trial that established its efficacy, the information is not presented in a fully balanced or objective manner.

Pros:
- It references the MOMS clinical trial and its results, indicating the use of research evidence.
- It acknowledges potential risks and challenges associated with the procedure.
- It includes perspectives from multiple members of the medical team, not just a single source.

Cons:
- The information is heavily centered around the personal narrative of one family's experience, rather than a broader, more objective overview of the condition and treatment options.
- There is no clear discussion or comparison of alternative treatment choices beyond the in-utero surgery.

The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to spina bifida or fetal surgery. The video focuses solely on explaining the specific case being discussed, the medical procedure performed, and the doctor's perspective. There are no suggestions for further reading or mentions of other organizations that could provide more advice and information about the topic."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. It discusses the debate and initial concerns around the in utero surgical repair procedure when it was first introduced in the late 1990s. Specifically, it mentions:

""And there was a lot of debate about well is it really worth the risk to the maternal health, is it really worth the risk to the fetal health, this is a dangerous thing to do, some of the medicines you're doing are very dangerous for the pregnancy, is this really the right thing to do?""

It also mentions how a large clinical trial (the MOMS trial) was conducted to evaluate if the in utero procedure provided better outcomes before it became more widely adopted. The transcript highlights the uncertainties and need for evidence that prompted this trial.

By discussing the initial debates, concerns, and the need for a large clinical trial to resolve uncertainties around the risks and benefits of this procedure,"," 3

The transcript provides some details on how the treatments for spina bifida work, but the descriptions are not comprehensive or fully clear for all treatments mentioned.

It explains that spina bifida is a failure of the spine and spinal cord to properly form and close in the first month of development, leading to defects and problems with movement, sensation, bowel/bladder function, and hydrocephalus. It mentions that the in-utero surgery aims to close this defect before birth to prevent or reduce these outcomes.

However, it does not go into much mechanistic detail about exactly how the surgery achieves those effects or how it acts on the body beyond closing the defect. It also does not describe the mechanisms of other potential treatments like shunting for hydrocephalus.

So while it covers the basics of how spina bifida occurs and that the fetal surgery tries to preemptively repair the defect, the descriptions of"," 4

The transcript describes the benefits of the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida quite well, including preventing or reducing neurological impairments, need for shunts, bowel/bladder problems, and orthopedic issues that would otherwise occur without the surgery. It mentions the surgery aims to achieve better outcomes than if left untreated.

However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits or outcomes of alternative treatments besides the fetal surgery, such as postnatal surgical repair or conservative management. Describing those would have made it a more complete comparison of treatment benefits. But overall, it provides good detail on the potential benefits of the fetal surgery itself, so I rated it a 4 out of 5."," 3

The video partially describes the risks of the treatments for spina bifida. It mentions some potential complications and adverse effects, but does not provide a comprehensive overview of all the risks associated with each treatment approach.

Specifically, the transcript discusses the following risks:

1. Risks of the fetal surgery (in utero repair):
   - It mentions that there were debates about whether the risks to maternal and fetal health were worth it, as the surgery and medicines involved were considered dangerous for the pregnancy.

2. Risks of not treating spina bifida:
   - It mentions potential problems with movement, sensation, bowel and bladder function, and hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain) if the condition is left untreated.

However, the video does not go into detail about the specific risks or side effects of each treatment option. It does not explicitly list out the potential complications or adverse reactions associated with the fetal"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with postponing treatment, watchful waiting, or permanently forgoing treatment for spina bifida. The video focuses primarily on describing the fetal surgery procedure performed to repair the spinal defect before birth. There is no mention of what would happen if no treatment was provided or if treatment was delayed until after birth."," 5

The transcript clearly describes how the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida can positively impact the overall quality of life for the child after birth. Several references are made to the improved outcomes and reduced impairments that babies treated with the surgery experience compared to those who do not receive the surgery.

Specifically, the transcript mentions that babies who undergo the fetal surgery have ""less overall orthopedic and neurologic impairment"" and are less likely to require a shunt for hydrocephalus. It also notes that the surgery can allow the child to ""walk"" and avoid being ""wheelchair bound,"" which significantly improves their mobility and independence in daily life.

The doctor directly states that the ability to ""really change one's kid's whole entire life with an operation early on"" is what makes the risky fetal surgery ""worth it"" in terms of improving the child's long-term quality of life. Overall, the potential impacts on reducing"," 5

The video clearly presents more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida and provides detailed information about the circumstances under which each choice may be appropriate.

It explains the standard approach of not intervening prenatally, which can lead to complications like impaired movement, bowel/bladder issues, and hydrocephalus requiring a shunt.

It then describes the fetal surgery option that was pioneered in 1997 and studied in the MOMS trial in 2003-2011. The video outlines the potential benefits of this procedure in reducing neurological impairment and need for shunts, while acknowledging it carries maternal/fetal risks.

The video highlights that the fetal surgery is only offered at specialized centers with the required expertise and multidisciplinary teams. It portrays the decision-making process of the parents who chose this option at this hospital based on their specific case and potential outcomes.

Overall, the"," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting discussions with doctors and other health professionals concerning treatment choices for spina bifida.

The transcript mentions that the parents were informed about the positive prenatal test result and the spinal defect diagnosis by doctors. They were then referred to a specialized center to understand the condition better and explore treatment options. The doctors explained the details of the spina bifida defect, its potential consequences, and the available surgical procedure to repair it in utero.

The doctors discussed the risks and benefits of the fetal surgery, highlighting the expertise and multidisciplinary team required for the procedure. The parents were involved in the decision-making process, as evidenced by statements like ""we would have to come here to really figure out you know exactly where it was and exactly what our outlook was"" and ""we're able to actually have a window up in the uterus and then be able to bring just the babies back",set()
dSjzCM4-6Y0,"Fetal surgery is about trying to save the lives or improve the lives of children by doing something before birth. It sounds like a crazy idea, operating inside the womb, but it's actually 30-years-old now and we've been doing it a long time. Spina bifida is a birth defect where the spinal cord and the spine don't form normally before birth. It fails to close. And because of that, that spinal cord is exposed to the elements in utero and then in theory, after birth. In the old days, we just took care of that problem after birth and protected the spinal cord, closed up the skin so that children would not get infected. They wouldn't get meningitis, an infection in the spinal cord, but we never had the expectation that it would improve their paralysis. We just assumed that paralysis was part of the problem of spina bifida. But we started to learn through the advent of ultrasound and by doing some studies in mice and things like that, that it appeared that the spinal cord, even though it was exposed was normal when it was formed. And it just seemed to lose function during gestation, that it was the trauma in utero. The exposure to amniotic fluid, just bumping up against the uterine wall that actually damaged the spinal cord. So, gosh, almost 20 years ago now, we asked the question, if we operated before birth, could that make the outcomes better? That's a study that was called the MOMS Trial. And interestingly, that was just finishing at the time I came to UC Davis. And what we discovered was that if you operated before birth, if you did fetal surgery, that in fact, those children did have a better outcome. I mean, this was miraculous. For the first time, the babies had some improvement in the ability to move their legs and it appeared that the spinal cord was somewhat improved. And I thought, ""If we can get some improvement, maybe we can get more improvement."" We looked at different kinds of cells. iPS cells were popular at the time, but we finally settled on mesenchymal stem cells from the placenta. We collaborated with Jan Nolta's group in the Institute for Regenerative Cures here at UC Davis, got advice and assistance from her. And then we took these special cells from the placenta, cultured them in a unique way that allowed these cells to secrete what I like to call ""magic stem cell juice."" We don't know exactly how it works, but we certainly know that it secretes lots of important growth factors for the spinal cord. We used a patch that is already approved by the FDA to repair problems either in the spinal cord or the brain when they need an extra layer to sort of close up what we call the dura, the lining of the central nervous system of the brain and the spinal cord. And we thought, ""Well, let's see if our cells can grow on this already FDA approved ""dural patch."" And not only did they grow, they seem to love it, but it's the same repair that was done for the big national trial. But this time we'll use a repair that includes this patch with cells on it. The reason it's important to do it almost exactly the same way it was done before is so that we can compare the results in a similarly rigorous fashion. So that we know it's really the cells that are making a difference.",Spina Bifida,4,4,4,3,2,3,1,5,2,2,2,1,1,4,2," 4

The video partially explains its aims, which seem to be discussing fetal surgery for spina bifida and a new approach using stem cells from the placenta. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront in a clear and concise way. The viewer has to piece together the aims from the narrative.

The video provides background on spina bifida and fetal surgery, explains why using placental stem cells is a promising approach, and describes the planned clinical trial comparing this new stem cell therapy to the previous standard fetal surgery approach. But it doesn't directly state something like ""The aim of this video is to explain our upcoming clinical trial testing placental stem cell therapy for fetal repair of spina bifida.""

So while the general aims become clear by the end, the lack of an explicit aim statement upfront makes the aims partially unclear initially. A clear, concise statement of the aims at the beginning would improve the clarity."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides a good overview of fetal surgery for spina bifida and the new approach being tested using stem cells from the placenta. It covers the background, motivation, previous clinical trial (MOMS Trial), and the new placenta stem cell approach being investigated. However, some key details are missing, such as the specific aims or goals of the new study, the expected outcomes or endpoints being measured, and the study design or methods. While it gives a general idea of the new approach, it doesn't fully outline all the information one might expect from a detailed description of the study aims and methodology. Therefore, I would rate it a 4 - providing most but not all of the expected information from a clear statement of the study aims."," 4

The transcript provides relevant information about fetal surgery for treating spina bifida, a birth defect affecting the spinal cord. It explains the background, motivation, and potential benefits of this surgical approach, as well as the specific stem cell therapy being investigated by the researchers at UC Davis.

However, the transcript does not directly address common questions that readers might have, such as the risks and potential complications of the surgery, the success rates, the long-term outcomes for the children, or the availability and cost of this treatment. It focuses primarily on the scientific and technical aspects of the research.

Therefore, while the information is highly relevant to the topic of fetal surgery for spina bifida, it may not fully address all the questions that general readers might have. A more comprehensive explanation of the procedure, its implications, and its accessibility would make the video more relevant to a broader audience."," 3

The transcript provides some references to sources of information used, but does not comprehensively cite all the main claims or statements made.

The speaker mentions:

1. Studies in mice that suggested the spinal cord was initially normal in spina bifida cases, and the damage occurred later during gestation.
2. The MOMS Trial, which studied the outcomes of fetal surgery for spina bifida.

Explanation:

The transcript provides information about fetal surgery for spina bifida, specifically a new approach using stem cells from the placenta. While the overall tone is informative and objective, there are a few aspects that raise some concerns about potential bias:

1. Personal perspective: The transcript includes some personal anecdotes and opinions from the speaker, such as ""I thought, 'If we can get some improvement, maybe we can get more improvement.'"" This personal perspective could introduce some bias.

2. Lack of alternative viewpoints: The transcript focuses solely on the potential benefits of the new stem cell approach without discussing potential risks, limitations, or alternative treatments. This could be seen as a one-sided portrayal.

3. Promotional language: Phrases like ""magic stem cell juice"" and ""not only did they grow, they seem to love it"" could be perceived as promotional or sensational language, rather than purely objective scientific descriptions"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to fetal surgery or spina bifida treatment. It is focused entirely on describing the research and approach being taken by the medical team at UC Davis for using stem cells in fetal surgery for spina bifida. No suggestions are made for further reading or other organizations that could provide more information on this topic."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for spina bifida. The speaker acknowledges that the idea of fetal surgery was initially considered ""crazy"" and that the understanding of the potential benefits of prenatal intervention evolved over time through research and clinical studies.

The speaker mentions that the initial expectation was that paralysis was an inherent part of spina bifida, but later studies suggested that the exposure and trauma to the spinal cord during gestation might be the cause of damage and loss of function. This led to the question of whether prenatal surgery could improve outcomes, which was explored in the MOMS Trial.

While the MOMS Trial showed some improvement in leg movement and spinal cord function with prenatal surgery, the speaker expresses a desire to achieve further improvement, leading to the exploration of using stem cells and a specialized patch in the repair process. However, the speaker also acknowledges uncertainty about the"," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how the treatments (fetal surgery and stem cell therapy) work, but the descriptions are incomplete or unclear in certain aspects.

For fetal surgery for spina bifida, the transcript explains that it aims to prevent further damage to the exposed spinal cord by closing the defect before birth, as the exposure and trauma during gestation are thought to cause the paralysis. However, it does not go into specifics of how the surgical procedure itself is performed.

For the stem cell therapy, the transcript mentions using mesenchymal stem cells from the placenta that secrete ""magic stem cell juice"" with growth factors beneficial for the spinal cord. It also mentions using an FDA-approved dural patch seeded with these stem cells for the repair. However, the exact mechanisms by which the stem cells and their secretions act on the body to improve spinal cord function are not clearly described.

While some high"," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It explains that the traditional post-birth treatment for spina bifida aimed to protect the exposed spinal cord from infection but did not improve paralysis. It then mentions that fetal surgery before birth showed improvement in the babies' ability to move their legs, suggesting a benefit of this treatment in improving spinal cord function and reducing paralysis.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits of the proposed new treatment involving stem cells and a patch. It states that the new approach aims to improve upon the existing fetal surgery, but does not specify the expected benefits or outcomes.

Therefore, while the transcript describes benefits for some treatments (traditional post-birth treatment and existing fetal surgery), it does not describe benefits for the proposed new stem cell and patch treatment. As such, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes risks of the treatments discussed. It does not explicitly mention any risks, side-effects, complications or adverse reactions associated with the fetal surgery or stem cell treatments being described. However, it does acknowledge that operating inside the womb on a fetus ""sounds like a crazy idea"", implying there are inherent risks involved with fetal surgery. Beyond this vague acknowledgement, no specific risks are detailed for either the fetal surgery or the stem cell therapy being proposed. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as risks are only partially covered by briefly suggesting fetal surgery carries risks, without providing any details."," 1

The transcript does not mention any risks or benefits associated with not using treatment or watchful waiting for spina bifida.

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear reference to the effects of the different treatment choices (fetal surgery with or without stem cell therapy) on the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of the patients. The focus is primarily on describing the medical procedures, their rationale, and the potential for improved motor function/reduced paralysis. However, there is no discussion of how these improvements might translate to better quality of life or impact daily activities. The transcript is purely from a medical/scientific perspective without addressing the patient experience or quality of life aspects."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It discusses the traditional approach of treating the condition after birth, as well as the more recent approach of fetal surgery. The transcript also mentions the potential use of stem cells from the placenta in combination with the fetal surgery approach, suggesting an alternative or additional treatment option. However, the transcript does not provide a clear comparison of who might benefit more from each treatment option or under what specific circumstances one approach might be preferred over another. The focus is primarily on describing the new stem cell therapy approach rather than comprehensively outlining the various treatment choices and their respective benefits or drawbacks."," 2

The video provides some information that could be useful for shared decision-making, but does not directly suggest discussing treatment options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals.

The video explains in detail the background, rationale, and approach for a new experimental treatment for spina bifida using stem cells from the placenta. It describes how this treatment builds on previous successful fetal surgery trials and uses an FDA-approved patch, with the goal of further improving outcomes.

While the video provides technical details about the new treatment, it does not explicitly recommend having conversations about whether to pursue this experimental treatment or other treatment options. The focus is more on explaining the scientific/medical basis for the new approach rather than encouraging shared decision-making discussions.

However, some of the background information provided could potentially inform conversations with doctors about the risks, benefits, and alternatives when considering fetal surgery or stem cell treatments for spina bifida. But overall, the video lacks direct prom",set()
jpFLPfsUr1c,"Heather Jovanola, MD My name is Heather Jovanola. Brian Jovanola, MD And I'm Brian Jovanola. Our son Thomas is three and a half. Heather Jovanola, MD Thomas is our first son. So he was my first pregnancy. We did all the normal testing that you thought they would do. All my test results came back perfectly normal. And then when we went in at 21 weeks for our mid-pregnancy ultrasound, that was the first time that we saw that there was something wrong. That there was, you know, developmentally they were seeing some signs in his head and some signs on his back that he had this diagnosis of spina bifida that we had never heard of before. Dr. Heather Jovanola, MD For a young couple, finding out that they have a fetus with a problem is one of the most devastating things that can ever happen. One of the reasons that we fetal surgeons wanted to attack the problem of spina bifida is that spina bifida results in lifelong disability. A child is born with this disease and has it for life. And there's very little that's been able to be done after birth to improve the outcomes of these children. Brian Jovanola, MD And in the past, the surgical treatment for that has simply been to repair the defect which is in the lower back. And it mainly is a way to protect the skin, protect the nervous system, but not as a way to try to improve any of the disability that the patients have. Dr. Heather Jovanola, MD What the doctors at UCSF made sure we knew was that this was a huge risk to me as a mother. So the baby has to have the surgery at some point to close up his back, but he doesn't have to have it right now. On the other hand, UCSF is very good at this. We pioneered prenatal surgery. So that was very comforting going in, even though we knew this is a big deal. It was a long day. And finally the doctor came walking out, big smile, said, your son has a really cute butt. And so we kind of knew everything was okay when he was joking around. It was a big relief. I think for mothers who have a fetus diagnosis of spina bifida, I think it becomes an extremely important consideration and a very compelling case to be made to consider a fetal surgery very seriously. Another thing he'll do, and we love to have him do it, is when he comes grocery shopping with me, he wants to walk around and see all the things that are right at his eye level. He wants to grab things off the shelf and put them in the cart. So we let him do that. And he can handle walking for an hour and a half in the grocery store because it's so much fun for him to have the freedom to move around and see whatever he wants to see. And that really makes us feel good that the choices we've made and him being able to have the surgery have on some level allowed him to be that mobile instead of in a wheelchair.",Spina Bifida,4,4,4,2,2,4,1,5,3,3,2,1,5,5,4," 4

The video partially states its aims in an indirect way. The aims are not explicitly laid out, but they can be inferred from the content:

1) To share the personal story and experience of parents who had a child diagnosed with spina bifida during pregnancy.

2) To highlight fetal surgery as a treatment option for spina bifida and discuss its potential benefits.

3) To provide some education and background information on spina bifida as a condition.

While the specific aims are not directly stated upfront, the transcript covers these topics through the parents' narrative and the doctor's explanations. However, the aims could have been made clearer with a more direct introduction or outline at the beginning."," 4

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information about spina bifida, the challenges faced by parents of children with this condition, and the potential benefits of fetal surgery to treat it. The transcript covers the following key points:

1. It introduces spina bifida as a birth defect that can lead to lifelong disability.
2. It explains the traditional post-birth surgical treatment and its limitations.
3. It discusses the risks and benefits of fetal surgery as an alternative treatment option.
4. It provides a personal account from parents who opted for fetal surgery and their positive experience with their child's mobility and quality of life.

However, the transcript does not provide detailed medical information about the causes, symptoms, and long-term consequences of spina bifida. It also lacks specifics on the fetal surgery procedure itself, potential complications, and long-term outcomes for children who undergo this treatment.

The video transcript provides relevant information about spina bifida, its effects, and the prenatal surgery option to mitigate some of the disabilities associated with the condition. The personal experiences shared by the parents, Heather and Brian Jovanola, give a firsthand account of the emotional and medical journey they went through when their son Thomas was diagnosed with spina bifida during pregnancy.

The transcript covers the following relevant points:

1. Explanation of spina bifida and its lifelong impacts.
2. The option of prenatal surgery to potentially improve outcomes.

However, the transcript does not provide comprehensive medical details about spina bifida, its causes, or the specifics of the prenatal surgical procedure"," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some references to sources of information, but they are not detailed or comprehensive. The doctors at UCSF are mentioned as pioneers in prenatal surgery, implying they are experts in the field. However, there are no specific citations or references to research studies or other evidence to support the claims made about spina bifida, its effects, and the benefits of fetal surgery. The transcript mainly relies on the personal experiences and opinions of the parents (Heather and Brian Jovanola) and the doctors at UCSF. While their expertise and first-hand accounts are valuable, the lack of explicit references to external sources of evidence means the sources of information are only partially clear."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date-related information given is that their son Thomas is three and a half years old at the time of the video. However, there are no dates mentioned for any studies, research papers, or other sources that may have been referenced in creating the video content about spina bifida and fetal surgery. Therefore, I can only assign a score of 2, indicating that the dates for the main sources of information are partially clear or unclear."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript presents a personal account from the parents of a child with spina bifida who underwent fetal surgery. While their perspective is inherently subjective, the transcript also includes objective information from medical professionals (Dr. Heather Jovanola and Dr. Brian Jovanola) about the condition, treatment options, and the potential benefits of fetal surgery.

The transcript acknowledges the risks and challenges associated with fetal surgery, indicating an attempt at balanced representation. However, it primarily focuses on the positive outcomes and benefits experienced by their child, which could be seen as biased toward promoting fetal surgery as a treatment option.

The information provided appears to be primarily based on the personal experience of this family and the expertise of the medical professionals involved in their case, without explicit reference to a range of research studies or other expert sources. This lack of broader scientific evidence could be seen as a limitation in terms of presenting a fully unbi"," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support and information related to spina bifida or fetal surgery. The transcript only focuses on the personal story and experience of the parents, Heather and Brian Jovanola, regarding their son Thomas's diagnosis of spina bifida and the fetal surgery they opted for at UCSF. There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information about spina bifida or fetal surgery."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. Specifically, it discusses the option of prenatal surgery, which was a new approach pioneered at UCSF, as opposed to the traditional approach of waiting until birth to repair the defect. The doctors made it clear to the parents that the prenatal surgery carried significant risks for the mother, indicating there was uncertainty and potential downsides to that treatment choice. The parents ultimately decided to proceed with the prenatal surgery, but the video acknowledges the difficulty of that decision and the uncertainties involved. Overall, the video provides a clear reference to the uncertainties and differing expert opinions surrounding treatment choices for spina bifida."," 3

Explanation:

The transcript provides some details on how the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida works, but the description is limited and does not go into comprehensive mechanistic details.

Specifically, it mentions that the fetal surgery aims to repair the defect before birth, instead of waiting until after birth to do the repair. This suggests the treatment works by closing the opening in the spinal cord and back area earlier in development. It also notes that this early intervention may help improve outcomes and reduce disability compared to repairing after birth.

However, it does not provide in-depth details about the biological mechanisms by which performing the surgery prenatally leads to better outcomes versus postnatally. The physiological processes involved are not described.

For the other treatments mentioned like testing during pregnancy and standard postnatal spina bifida repair, there are no details provided about their mechanisms of action.

So while there is some useful information about how the f"," 3

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments for spina bifida. It mentions that fetal surgery was a treatment option for their son Thomas, and it implies that this surgery helped improve his mobility and allowed him to walk around instead of being in a wheelchair. However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the specific benefits of the fetal surgery or any other potential treatments for spina bifida.

The parents mention that the fetal surgery carried risks for the mother, and that it was a ""big deal,"" but they don't go into detail about the potential benefits beyond saying that it allowed Thomas to be more mobile. They also mention that the traditional postnatal surgery to repair the defect is primarily to protect the skin and nervous system, but not to improve disability.

Explanation:
The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments for spina bifida. It mentions that the fetal surgery to repair spina bifida before birth is a ""huge risk to me as a mother"" and that it is a ""big deal"". However, it does not provide any specific details on what those risks or potential complications are for the mother undergoing that prenatal surgery.

The transcript does not appear to mention any risks or potential side effects associated with the alternative post-birth treatment of surgically repairing the spinal defect after delivery.

So while it acknowledges there are significant risks to the fetal surgery, it does not describe what those risks actually are. And it does not mention any risks of the postnatal surgical repair option. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as risks are mentioned for one treatment approach but not fully described, and no risks are noted for the other treatment approach"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating spina bifida or postponing treatment. The doctors mention that the fetal surgery carries risks for the mother, but they do not elaborate on what would happen if no treatment is pursued. The focus is primarily on describing their experience with the fetal surgery treatment and the positive outcomes they observed in their son's mobility after the surgery. There is no mention of watchful waiting, permanently forgoing treatment, or the potential consequences of those options."," 5

The video clearly describes how the treatment choice of prenatal surgery for spina bifida affects Thomas's overall quality of life and day-to-day activity. Specifically, it mentions that the surgery allowed Thomas to be more mobile and have the freedom to walk around for extended periods, such as during grocery shopping trips, rather than being confined to a wheelchair. The parents express their happiness that the choice they made enabled Thomas to have a better quality of life and engage in normal activities that would have been more difficult without the surgery."," 5

Explanation: The video clearly indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It mentions two options:

1. Fetal surgery (prenatal surgery) to repair the spinal defect before birth, which the video suggests can improve outcomes and mobility compared to the traditional post-birth surgery.

2. Traditional post-birth surgery to repair the defect, which the video states was mainly to protect the skin and nervous system but not to improve disability.

The video highlights the potential benefits of the fetal surgery option for improving mobility and quality of life, as evidenced by their son Thomas's ability to walk around and explore at the grocery store after undergoing the fetal surgery. However, it also acknowledges the significant risks involved with fetal surgery for the mother.

Overall, the video presents a clear choice between two treatment options (fetal surgery vs. traditional post-birth surgery) and discusses the potential benefits and"," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, though not very explicit or detailed. The parents, Heather and Brian Jovanola, mention being informed about the risks and options by their doctors at UCSF regarding treatment for their son Thomas's spina bifida diagnosis. They express feeling comforted by UCSF's expertise in prenatal surgery, which allowed them to make the decision to proceed with fetal surgery. However, there are no specific suggestions given about things to discuss with doctors or others regarding treatment choices. The focus is more on their personal experience and journey rather than directly advocating for shared decision-making. Overall, the video lends some implicit support to the idea of patients being informed and involved in major medical decisions, but does not provide explicit guidance on the shared decision-making process itself.",set()
Yh47aMX-_9M,"So myelomeningocele is the most common form of spina bifida and it results from lack of closure of the primitive spinal cord which is the neural tube in the fetus at the bottom end and so the spinal cord and nerve roots and covering layers of the spinal cord are fused to the skin and muscle and it leaks spinal fluid out and leads to other complications over time including a Chiari malformation and subsequent hydrocephalus or the build-up of spinal fluid in the head and patients who undergo postnatal closure have an approximate 80% risk of hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventricular peritoneal shunt which is an implanted device. Unfortunately shunts are associated with a lot of morbidity and complications during childhood and life for children with spina bifida and myelomeningocele. So why do we do this in utero? For generations this repair has been done postnatally but as pediatric surgeons and neurosurgeons what we found is that over time the dye is already cast by the time the baby is born. Obstetricians have noticed for several years now that they've been able to see many of these fetuses moving their legs in utero but by the time they're born they're no longer able to move their legs and they're paralyzed. So it was thought really that there's some ongoing injury that occurs during the pregnancy. The goal of doing this operation early before birth is to try to improve the function of the baby, to improve their leg strength and perhaps their bowel and bladder function and also importantly to minimize their risk of developing hydrocephalus that conditioned fluid on the brain. And when they do develop hydrocephalus and they need a shunt those shunts unfortunately don't work perfectly and they lead to all kinds of complications and it turns out that by doing this operation before birth it seems to cut that shunt rate in half and so we're very optimistic that we can have that same result for this infant. The patient is Naomi, she's 23 years old and this is essentially her first pregnancy to this point and the baby is around 25 weeks gestation, remembering of course that a normal pregnancy gestation is around 40 weeks so we're just a little tiny bit over halfway in the pregnancy. The baby has an open spinal defect called a spina bifida and the object of the surgery today is to close that lesion for a number of reasons. The leakage of the fluid out of this open lesion does two things at least that we know of. One is to expose the nerves to the amniotic fluid and two is to allow the leaking of fluid such that the cerebellum at the base of the brain can undergo pressure, this is called a Chiari 2 malformation and that kind of pressure on the intracranial structures can result both in issues with the cerebellum and with the ventricles of the brain so the baby's ventricles can become dilated. So by closing this lesion we're hoping to prevent ongoing injury and hopefully preserve neurologic function and in even some cases we believe it's possible to regain some neurologic function. It's a rather tricky operation that we did today. It's open fetal surgery so the mother is asleep under a very deep anesthetic. We have to then perform a C-section type incision on the mother to open up her tummy and to expose the uterus and then we have to open the uterus. This is the pregnant uterus that's filled with amniotic fluid so we have to open that up and the amniotic fluid will come out and then we expose this spina bifida deformity in the fetus and then the neurosurgeons Dr. Bolo and Jay today came in and did that repair of that spina bifida defect and then very importantly we then have to close that uterus up with stitches and keep it pregnant and keep the baby inside the uterus and we have to have it so it doesn't leak that amniotic fluid and that the pregnancy can continue and that's where this becomes pretty tricky and pretty difficult. Well so far the operation went perfectly today. We were able to open the uterus very nicely, expose the deformity in the fetus, the spina bifida repair seemed to go very smoothly and we were able to get that uterus closed up very nicely and so far mom and baby are recovering very well. I don't see any signs of labor. The uterus seems to be snugly closed and the mother is now recovering from the anesthesia and she's doing very well. It was really a multidisciplinary total force with all the different disciplines present everybody worked well seamlessly perfectly, it was a well choreographed perfectly executed surgical procedure. It's not often that surgeons use the palliatives but this is actually one of those times that I think it's rightfully deserved.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,2,1,4,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,3,2," 5

Overall, while the video suggests a collaborative and comprehensive approach to care, it does not provide strong or direct support",set()
aW_mLBlZES8,"Everything was going well with the ultrasounds and the checkups and on our 18th week they said we wouldn't hear from them unless there was an issue. The next morning my wife got a phone call. They said that there were signs of spina bifida. We were told if we didn't have an intervention she would be paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down. Also could cause being catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair with it, have a brain shunt. I mean there was just so much different things and for me as a mom it wasn't necessarily what it would mean to our family. It was just how do you protect her? How do you let her live a normal life? It's like time stopped. You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong. My husband was, we will do whatever we have to do. We will go wherever we have to go to give our kid the best options. We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia. There's only approximately 4,000 kids a year born with spina bifida. We just wanted to get the best program available. You know that you're going to be this family's point person in a very, very stressful time in their life. You're just not expecting anything to be wrong and then you get hit with this, you know. So it's very emotional for them. You go from them from the time they find out they have a fetal anomaly in their 18, 20 week ultrasound until the time they get to go home with that baby and it's just, it's so rewarding to be a part of that. The next day I received a call that morning from Carol. She explained everything to me, answered every question. The main one was one of the options you have is to operate on your baby before it's even born. I had no idea that you could go into a woman's womb and operate on a fetus and especially, especially to the magnitude that this is. For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery. In their case the legs were still strong and the lesion was in the middle of the back. So in those cases if you can close the back in the second trimester you can protect those nerves and preserve function. By doing the fetal surgery we found that you can reduce by half the number of babies that need this shunt. So avoidance of this shunt, avoidance of the hydrocephalus is the number one goal of this kind of fetuscopic surgery. The second goal is to try and preserve as much nerve function as possible. The longer that the nerves are exposed to the amniotic fluid the greater the degree of damage to those nerves. The earlier we can cover up those nerves with a skin covering and prevent their exposure to amniotic fluid the more of the function of those nerves we can save. For us we had to do whatever we could given that she had motor function movement in her feet and her legs. We couldn't live with ourselves if we didn't give her that chance. I think when we were finished Dr. Belfort said we were the 23rd successful two port fetuscopic surgery in the history of the United States and that's just, I still don't fathom that. There isn't much that we haven't seen and there's a lot that we can offer in terms of treatments and therapy to try to minimize the effects of spina bifida. This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input, the radiology, the diagnostics involved are critically important. The way that the neonatologists and the obstetricians and the pediatric surgeons work together is critically important. It is a team effort. Texas Children's has all of that and has it down and it's world renowned for that. We've done more than anybody in the United States and we developed the two port procedure right here. The results of our procedure at the moment in terms of the gestational age at delivery are the best in the world, no question. So the day of delivery, the family was in the room, we were in the room, the emotions were there, the happiness was there, the joy was there. As of now she's a little over nine months old. She has full movement of her legs, feet, toes. We've had no issue with hydrocephalus at this point. She's a normal baby to us. You can't tell by looking at her or how she acts or any of her motor skills or functions that anything's wrong. A year and two months ago when we got the news, this is not where I seen me. I did not see that I would have a nine month old that is sitting up on her own that is going backwards, she's going in circles, she's not quite crawling yet but she's almost there. I never thought at this point that I would see the day with no orthopedics or anything that my daughter could stand on her own. Texas Children's is who we thank for that. Without this fetal team, our daughter would not be where she is today. We will forever be grateful to them. We can't say thank you enough. Thank you just sounds so meaningless. Words can't express our gratitude and our thanks for the blessings that they've given us with our child. We couldn't ask for anything more.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,4,4,4,1,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,3," 5

The aims of the video are very clear from the transcript.

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates or time references related to the medical procedures and the child's development, but does not explicitly mention the dates or sources for the broader medical information presented. Specifically:

- It mentions the 18th week of pregnancy when the initial ultrasound detected spina bifida.
- It refers to the child being over 9 months old at the time of recording, allowing us to estimate the timing of the fetal surgery.
- However, it does not provide dates or sources for the general information about spina bifida, fetal surgery procedures, statistics on prevalence, etc.

So while some key dates related to this specific case are mentioned, the dates or sources for the broader medical information used in the video are not explicitly stated. Therefore, I would give a score of 4, indicating that the information is partially dated or sourced."," 4 (Partially balanced and unbiased)

Explanation:
The video transcript presents a personal story and experience of a family dealing with spina bifida during pregnancy. While it focuses on the positive outcome achieved through fetal surgery at Texas Children's Hospital, it also acknowledges the challenges, risks, and emotional turmoil associated with the condition.

The video highlights the expertise and collaborative approach of the medical team at Texas Children's Hospital, providing some objective information about spina bifida, fetal surgery, and the potential benefits. However, it primarily relies on the personal narrative of the family and the medical team's perspective, without explicitly referencing other sources of information or alternative treatment options.

While the video is not overtly biased or sensational, it does have a positive slant towards the fetal surgery approach and the specific hospital's program. It lacks a more comprehensive discussion of other potential treatments or perspectives, which could be seen as somewhat unbal"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the care received at Texas Children's Hospital. While the parents express immense gratitude to the medical team there, no suggestions are made for further reading materials or other organizations that could provide advice and information about spina bifida or fetal surgery procedures."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. This is evident in the following statements:

1) ""You just, you have so many unknowns and unknown questions and to know that you're a child there's something wrong.""
2) ""We started doing research with programs around the country in Boston and Philadelphia.""
3) The parents had to choose between the options of fetal surgery or not, with the doctor explaining the potential benefits and risks of fetal surgery: ""For certain patients there's the chance of significant benefit for fetal surgery.""

The doctors also acknowledge the uncertainties and complexities involved, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary team approach:

""This kind of work needs to be done in a very collaborative, multidisciplinary way. It is not simply getting the surgery. There's got to be neurosurgery input, neonatal intensive care input"," 5

The transcript provides a detailed description of how the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida works and its intended effects on the body. Specifically, it explains that by operating on the fetus and closing the back during the second trimester, it can:

1) Protect the exposed nerves from further damage by the amniotic fluid, preserving nerve function and mobility.

2) Reduce the likelihood of needing a shunt to treat hydrocephalus (buildup of fluid in the brain) by about 50%.

The transcript clearly outlines the goals and mechanisms of this fetal surgery approach in protecting nerve function and avoiding complications like hydrocephalus and paralysis. It meets the criteria for a score of 5 by including details on how this treatment acts on the body to achieve its therapeutic effects."," 5

Explanation: The transcript clearly describes the benefits of the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida. The key benefits mentioned are:

1. Reducing the need for a shunt to treat hydrocephalus by half compared to not having the surgery.
2. Preserving nerve function and mobility by covering the exposed nerves earlier, preventing further damage from amniotic fluid exposure.
3. In the specific case mentioned, the baby had full movement of legs, feet, and toes after the surgery, with no issues of hydrocephalus or need for orthopedics at 9 months old.

The transcript highlights these significant benefits of the fetal surgery in controlling symptoms, preventing complications, and improving the long-term outcome for the baby. Therefore, it satisfies the criteria of describing benefits for the treatment, earning a score of 5."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It outlines some of the potential risks and complications associated with spina bifida if left untreated, such as paralysis, needing a catheter, being in a wheelchair, and needing a brain shunt. However, it does not explicitly mention the risks or potential side effects of the fetal surgery itself, which was the main treatment option discussed.

The transcript focuses more on explaining the fetal surgery procedure, its goals (avoiding the need for a shunt and preserving nerve function), and the positive outcome for the baby after the surgery. While it praises the expertise and multidisciplinary approach of the medical team, there is no detailed discussion of the risks or complications that could arise from the fetal surgery itself."," 5

The transcript clearly describes the risks and potential outcomes if no treatment (fetal surgery) was pursued for the baby's spina bifida condition. Specifically, it mentions that without the intervention/surgery, the baby would likely be ""paralyzed from the knees down, possibly the waist down"" and may require being ""catheterized her life, possibly being in a wheelchair"" and having ""a brain shunt."" It contrasts this with the benefits they experienced by going through with the fetal surgery, such as the baby having ""full movement of her legs, feet, toes"" and no issues with hydrocephalus so far. The parents directly state that without the fetal surgery team, ""our daughter would not be where she is today."" So the transcript provides a clear description of the risks associated with forgoing treatment."," 5

The transcript clearly describes how the fetal surgery treatment choice for spina bifida affected the overall quality of life for the baby. There are multiple references to the positive impacts of the surgery in preserving nerve function, avoiding the need for a shunt, and allowing for normal motor skills and development. The parents express gratitude that their daughter can move her legs, feet and toes normally, sit up on her own, and is progressing towards crawling - milestones they did not expect without the fetal surgery treatment. Their descriptions vividly illustrate how this treatment choice profoundly improved their child's quality of life compared to the paralysis and disabilities they were originally told to expect without intervention."," 5

Explanation: The video transcript clearly indicates that there were multiple treatment options presented for the fetal condition of spina bifida. It discusses the option of not intervening, which would likely result in paralysis and other complications. It then goes on to describe the fetal surgery option in detail, highlighting the potential benefits of undergoing this procedure to reduce the need for a shunt and preserve nerve function. The parents' decision process of researching different programs and considering the pros and cons of each option is also depicted. The multidisciplinary team approach involving various specialists is emphasized for providing comprehensive care. Overall, the video makes it abundantly clear that there were different treatment choices available, along with their respective risks, benefits, and circumstances to consider."," 3

The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is not a central focus. The parents mention doing research on programs around the country and choosing the best available option for their child's treatment. They also discuss the different treatment options, including fetal surgery, with the medical team. However, the transcript does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family or friends outside of the medical professionals. The emphasis is more on the parents' emotional journey and their gratitude towards the medical team that provided the successful fetal surgery treatment. While shared decision-making is implied in their process of choosing the right treatment path, it is not explicitly encouraged or detailed in the transcript.",{5}
NjQBq0GH8BM,"Hello, my name is Dr. Gina Miller and I am the leader of the Fetoscopic Spina Bifida Repair Program at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy. In the following video, I will share with you our minimally invasive multilayer technique for closure of fetal spina bifida. The surgery is performed by opening the mother's abdomen and exposing the uterus. Stitches are placed to secure the membranes to the uterine wall. A small plastic port about the size of a pencil is inserted. The amniotic fluid is removed and a safe amount of warm carbon dioxide gas is used to create a dry working space. The baby's position is adjusted as needed. A second port is placed using the same process as the first one. Next, the exposed portion of the spinal cord is released. In order to perform a layered closure, a portion of the muscle is released on both sides. This is similar to the process used in open fetal surgery and surgeries performed after birth. A patch is placed over the exposed nerves to provide an additional barrier and minimize scarring. Then the muscle layer is closed over the patch. If the skin cannot be easily closed, a lateral incision is made in the skin to allow it to come together without too much tension. The goal is to achieve a watertight closure on the back. Lastly, the fluid is replaced, port's removed, and the abdomen is closed. The pregnancy is monitored closely and vaginal delivery at term is possible. If you have additional questions about this procedure, please contact us. We are always eager to help.

kuMHLfb8U_E,"It was just like, you know, any normal pregnancy that starts out. We were just going to our OBGYN appointment and just someone was saying that he looked good. So the doctor's doing the ultrasound and I'm thinking nothing of it. I mean, what are we looking at? And honestly, I fully expected him to say, oh, it's okay, everything's fine, you know, nothing to worry about. But he didn't. He said, yeah, we're looking at a case of spina bifida. It's a pretty severe case. Worst case scenario, they can't walk, you know, that they have trouble going to the bathroom and all of that. And I was just like, what do I do? So the doctor then took a plane to us. He said, well, there's a surgery that they can do while they're in utero, you know, and they can repair that. In utero surgery to close up spina bifida is basically to close up the defect of the baby's back to keep further damage from occurring that could occur if the closure happens after the baby's born. Something inside me said, you need a second opinion. I hadn't given up that faith. Fetal surgery is the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. It leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability. The day that Dr. Cass told us that they would be willing to do the surgery, Kimmy was 25 weeks pregnant and three days. They don't do the surgery past 26 weeks. The operation went perfectly and the outcome for both the mom and the fetus were as good as possibly could be expected. The scar on his back looks great. It's healing the way we want it to heal and everything was looking good. There's no word to express how grateful I am to everybody that was involved. I want him to do all the normal things that Boyd growing up should be able to do, but also through this be able to help other people. He has a purpose for his life, even if it is just telling the story to other people as he grows up to give them hope. He has a best life with three kids under the age of three.

While it does not explicitly cite research studies or expert opinions, it includes statements from medical professionals (the OBGYN doctor and Dr. Cass) regarding the diagnosis of spina bifida and the recommended fetal surgery. However, some claims, such as ""Fetal surgery is the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. It leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability,"" are not attributed to a specific source. Additionally, the personal experiences and reflections shared by the parent(s) are not supported by external sources, as they are based on their individual circumstances."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates related to the information presented, but not for all sources acknowledged. Specifically, it mentions that the mother was 25 weeks and 3 days pregnant when the surgery was scheduled (""Kimmy was 25 weeks pregnant and three days. They don't do the surgery past 26 weeks.""). However, no dates are provided for the other information sources, such as when the initial diagnosis was made, when the second opinion was sought, or when the surgery was performed. Therefore, a score of 3 (Partially) is appropriate, as only the date for one acknowledged source (the timing of the surgery) is clear."," 4 (Partially balanced and unbiased)

Explanation:
The transcript presents a personal account of a family's experience with spina bifida and the decision to undergo fetal surgery. While it primarily focuses on the positive outcome of the surgery and the family's gratitude, it also acknowledges the potential risks and challenges associated with spina bifida, such as difficulty walking and bladder control issues.

The video includes input from medical professionals, such as the OBGYN who initially diagnosed the condition and the surgeon who performed the fetal surgery. This suggests that the information is not solely based on personal anecdotes but also incorporates expert medical opinions.

However, the transcript does not provide a comprehensive overview of alternative treatment options or a balanced discussion of the potential risks and benefits of fetal surgery compared to other approaches. It primarily highlights the positive outcome of the chosen treatment path without delving into the potential drawbacks or limitations.

Additionally, while the"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to spina bifida or fetal surgery. It only discusses the personal experiences and perspectives of the parents regarding their child's diagnosis and treatment. No suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information on the topic are mentioned."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. When the condition was first diagnosed, the mother expresses uncertainty and confusion, saying ""I was just like, what do I do?"" She also mentions seeking a second opinion, indicating there was uncertainty about the initial recommended treatment course.

The video then discusses two main treatment options: in utero surgery to repair the spina bifida defect before birth, and postnatal treatment/management after birth. The doctor is quoted as saying ""Fetal surgery is the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida. It leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability."" However, the use of the word ""most"" implies there is still some uncertainty or cases where fetal surgery may not be the best option.

Overall, the reference to seeking a second opinion and the doctor's phrasing around fetal surgery being best for ""most"" cases"," 3

The transcript partially describes how the treatments work. It provides some details about the in utero surgery to repair spina bifida, stating that it involves ""closing up the defect of the baby's back to keep further damage from occurring that could occur if the closure happens after the baby's born."" However, it does not go into further technical details about how the surgery is performed or how it specifically acts on the body to achieve its effect.

The transcript does not provide any description of how other potential treatments for spina bifida, such as postnatal surgery or non-surgical treatments, might work. It only mentions that fetal surgery is considered the best treatment for most cases of spina bifida.

Overall, while the transcript touches on the general purpose and rationale behind the in utero surgery, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of how this or other treatments mechanistically function within the body."," 5

Explanation: The transcript describes the benefits of the in utero surgery for treating spina bifida. Specifically, it mentions that the surgery ""leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability"" for fetuses with spina bifida. It also states that the surgery went well and the outcome was ""as good as possibly could be expected."" While no explicit benefits are mentioned for not having the surgery, the implication is that without the surgery, the child would likely have more severe disabilities and poorer outcomes. Therefore, a benefit is described for the main treatment option discussed, which is the in utero surgery."," 2 (Partially)

Explanation:
The transcript describes the risks and potential complications associated with spina bifida, a congenital defect where the baby's spinal cord fails to develop properly. It mentions that in severe cases, the child may have difficulty walking and with bladder/bowel control.

However, the transcript does not explicitly mention the risks or potential complications associated with the in-utero surgery itself, which was the treatment option discussed. Fetal surgery carries significant risks for both the mother and the unborn child, such as preterm labor, bleeding, infection, and potential complications during the procedure or recovery, but these are not described in detail.

While the transcript highlights the potential benefits of the in-utero surgery in treating spina bifida, it lacks a comprehensive discussion of the risks involved with this invasive treatment option. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) seems appropriate, as the risks of the"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating spina bifida or postponing/forgoing the fetal surgery. The focus is entirely on the decision to proceed with the fetal surgery and the positive outcome from undergoing that treatment. There is no mention of what could have happened if they decided against the surgery or delayed treatment."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that fetal surgery is ""the best treatment for most fetuses with spina bifida"" and that it ""leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability."" This suggests that the fetal surgery treatment choice can improve the child's long-term quality of life by reducing potential disabilities associated with spina bifida. However, the transcript does not provide specific details on how the treatment choices would affect day-to-day activities or overall quality of life beyond mentioning the potential for reduced disabilities."," 5

Explanation: The video clearly indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It mentions two options: 1) In utero surgery to repair the spinal defect before birth, and 2) Not having the surgery and allowing the baby to be born with spina bifida. The video suggests that the in utero surgery is the best treatment option for most fetuses with spina bifida as it leads to the best outcome and the least amount of long-term disability. However, it also acknowledges that the parents sought a second opinion before deciding on the surgery, implying that there was a choice to be made. The video does not provide detailed information on who might benefit more from each treatment option or under what specific circumstances, but it does make it clear that there was a decision to be made between different treatment approaches."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making. It mentions that the parents sought a second opinion after the initial diagnosis of spina bifida, which suggests they were actively involved in making decisions about the treatment. The transcript also mentions that the doctor explained the option of in utero surgery and the potential outcomes, indicating that the doctor provided information to facilitate shared decision-making. However, the transcript does not explicitly mention discussions with family or other health professionals beyond the doctors, which would have made it a stronger example of shared decision-making.",set()
qRtspxmhYnA,"Once a family decides to pursue fetal surgery, things happen pretty rapidly. All the components of our rather large team meet to discuss the case and then have the parents come in and we go through the entire process once again so that there's a clear understanding of what's involved and give them the opportunity to ask any additional questions. We had to be down here, I don't know if it was five o'clock or six o'clock, but it was very early in the morning. I was so nervous. And you know, still a lot of consultations and things like that going on and you know. Flurry of activity. They put an epidural in was the first thing they were going to do and I had to be awake for that. You are knocked out for the surgery. I remember bending over getting that epidural and they're talking to me and all of a sudden you go, oh, I mean if it hadn't hit us already, it hit me then. This is big time. Seventeen days before that, life was normal and all of a sudden here we are. We're doing fetal surgery for something that's cutting edge. We have a special OR that we use for fetal surgery. It's a very large OR because there's a lot of equipment that's there and there are a lot of people involved in this. There are a couple of anesthesiologists. There's the fetal team. Two to three surgeons in the room. There's a cardiologist in the room who monitors the baby's heart through the entire procedure. There's a neurosurgeon who actually does the myelomeningocele repair. There's an obstetrician or maternal fetal medicine specialist in the room who monitors the mother's uterus and performs ultrasound so that we make sure we put the incision in the uterus where we need to put it. And it all has to be carefully choreographed so that everybody is focused on what their role is, what they need to do, but everybody has to work seamlessly together. The mother goes under deep general anesthesia. General anesthesia is important for at least three reasons. It anesthetizes the mother, anesthetizes the fetus, and also gives us very good uterine relaxation, relaxation of the uterine muscle, which is very important for the operation. An ultrasound is done to look at the fetal position and then a sideways wound is made, almost hip bone to hip bone, halfway between the belly button and the pubic bone to expose the uterus. Oft times the obstetrician will move the fetus within the uterus so that the myelomeningocele or spina bifida lesion is right underneath where we're going to make the cut in the uterus because the baby basically stays inside the uterus during the operation. The cut in the uterus is done again under ultrasound guidance, sterile intraoperative ultrasound guidance with a uterine stapling device that fires absorbable staples that pinch off all the blood vessels and keep the membranes around the baby tacked up to the muscle layer of the uterus. During the operation, the fetal cardiologist does monitoring of the fetal heart by echocardiography. We're able to look at blood flow patterns through the heart, the various structures and the flow towards the different organs, heart function. We look at the heart rate. We're able to feed that information back to the surgeons and to the anesthesiologist that's managing the mother. The neurosurgeon then comes in and he and I do the myelomeningocele repair exactly like you would do in a newborn after birth. I trim the sac of abnormal skin away from the nerve tissue. It's important to do that because that skin tissue, if I leave it behind, can become a cyst. There can be a problem later on. We then put the nerve tissue back into the spinal canal where it's supposed to be and then I try to get a three-layer closure. First layer is the dura. That's the normal covering of the brain and the spinal cord. The second layer is the fascia. That's kind of like muscle-type tissue. And then the third layer is the skin. The goal is to cover the unprotected spinal cord so that it's a watertight protective closure. It needs to be watertight for two reasons. One is that you want to stop the damage caused by amniotic fluid exposure for the rest of the pregnancy. And you also want to stop the leakage of cerebral spinal fluid out through the back that plays an important role in the development of hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. So if you stop the leak back here, the hindbrain can go back and the hydrocephalus is less of an issue. Once the uterine wound is closed, the maternal abdomen is closed, including the skin with a plastic surgical closure. All the layers are closed with an absorbable stitch that will dissolve once the mother's wound is healed.",Spina Bifida,3,4,4,2,1,3,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2," 3

The transcript provides some information about the aims of the video, which seems to be explaining the fetal surgery process for spina bifida repair. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, and the information is presented in a narrative format, making the overall aims slightly unclear.

The transcript covers details about the pre-surgery preparation, the surgical team involved, the anesthesia process, the steps of the surgery itself, and the post-surgery wound closure. While these details give an idea that the video aims to educate viewers about the fetal surgery procedure, a clear and concise statement of the aims is lacking.

So while the aims can be partially inferred from the content, they are not clearly and directly communicated, hence the score of 3 (Partially clear aims)."," 4

The video transcript provides a fairly comprehensive overview of the fetal surgery process for treating spina bifida. It covers key aspects such as the preparatory steps, the surgical team involved, the anesthesia procedures, the steps of the actual surgery, monitoring of the fetus during surgery, and the goals of the procedure. However, it does not provide much detail on potential risks, post-operative care, or long-term outcomes, which one might expect from a full description of the aims of such a surgical procedure. Overall, it fulfills many but not all of the expected informational aims, hence a score of 4 (Partially achieving the aims)."," 4 (Partially relevant)

Explanation:
The transcript provides detailed information about the fetal surgery process for treating spina bifida, which is relevant to readers interested in learning about this medical procedure. However, it does not directly address specific questions that readers might have, such as the risks and benefits of the surgery, the success rates, or the long-term outcomes for the baby and mother. The transcript focuses more on the technical aspects of the surgery itself rather than addressing common concerns or queries from a patient's perspective. Therefore, while the information is generally relevant to the topic of fetal surgery for spina bifida, it may not fully address all the questions that readers might have."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details about the sources of information used, but it does not explicitly cite or reference any specific research studies or expert opinions. The information appears to be based primarily on the author's own expertise and experience as a medical professional involved in fetal surgery procedures.

While the video describes the surgical process and reasoning behind certain steps in detail, there are no clear references to external sources such as published research papers, medical guidelines, or quotes from other experts in the field. The information seems to be presented from the author's firsthand knowledge and perspective.

Therefore, I would give a score of 2 (Partially), as the sources of evidence are not explicitly stated or referenced, but the information is likely based on the author's professional expertise and experience in this area of medicine."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates or time periods for the sources of information used to compile the video. While it describes the surgical process and experiences of the medical team and patients in detail, there are no clear references to when this information was produced or from what sources it was gathered. Without any dates or time frames given for the underlying sources, I cannot assign a higher score based on the provided transcript alone."," 3

Explanation:

The transcript provides a detailed description of the fetal surgery process from multiple perspectives, including the medical team, parents, and various medical specialties involved. This suggests an attempt to present a comprehensive and balanced view of the procedure. However, there are a few potential biases to consider:

1. The transcript focuses solely on the advantages and benefits of fetal surgery without addressing potential risks, complications, or alternative treatment options. This could be seen as presenting an imbalanced view favoring fetal surgery.

2. While multiple experts are cited, they all seem to be part of the same medical team performing the fetal surgery. There is no clear indication of seeking perspectives from independent sources or experts who may have differing views on the procedure.

3. The language used, particularly in some of the parent's quotes, conveys a sense of urgency and emotionality (""This is big time,"" ""life was normal and all of a sudden"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to fetal surgery for spina bifida. The transcript is focused solely on describing the surgical procedure itself and the roles of the medical team involved. There are no suggestions for further reading or details about other organizations that could provide advice and information on this topic."," 1

The provided transcript does not explicitly mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for fetal surgery. The transcript thoroughly describes the procedural steps involved in fetal surgery, including the roles of different medical professionals, anesthesia administration, making incisions, repairing the spinal defect, and closing the surgical sites. However, it does not discuss any uncertainties, differences in expert opinions, or limitations associated with the treatment choices. The information presented is factual and procedural, without addressing areas of uncertainty."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how some of the treatments work, but does not provide details for all treatments mentioned. It provides a detailed description of the surgical procedure to repair the myelomeningocele (spina bifida) on the fetus, explaining how the neurosurgeon covers the exposed spinal cord and nervous tissue to protect it from further damage and prevent fluid leakage. However, it does not explain the mechanisms of action for other treatments like epidural anesthesia, general anesthesia, or fetal heart monitoring during the surgery. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that some but not all treatment descriptions include details of how they work."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of fetal surgery for spina bifida. It mentions that the goal of the surgery is to cover the exposed spinal cord to stop further damage from amniotic fluid exposure and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, which can help prevent hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of other treatments or management options for spina bifida, such as postnatal surgery or shunting procedures. The focus is primarily on explaining the fetal surgery procedure itself."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks of the fetal surgery treatment. While it provides a detailed explanation of the surgical procedure itself, it does not explicitly mention potential risks, side-effects, complications, or adverse reactions that could arise from the treatment, either in the short-term or long-term.

The only potential risk that is briefly touched upon is the risk of hydrocephalus (build-up of fluid in the brain) if the surgical repair is not watertight and allows leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. However, this is framed more as a goal of the surgery to prevent this complication, rather than explicitly stating it as a potential risk.

Other than this, no specific risks, side-effects, or potential complications of the fetal surgery are described in the transcript. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as the video only partially describes risks for this particular treatment."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any mention of the risks or benefits associated with not pursuing fetal surgery or any other treatment option for the condition being discussed (spina bifida). The transcript focuses entirely on describing the process and procedures involved in performing fetal surgery for spina bifida repair. There is no reference to what would happen if treatment is postponed, if a ""watchful waiting"" approach is taken, or if treatment is permanently forgone."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any reference to the overall quality of life or the effects of the treatment choices on day-to-day activities. The transcript focuses entirely on describing the technical details of the fetal surgery procedure, including the roles of different medical professionals, the steps involved, and the goals of the surgery. There is no mention of how the treatment choices (presumably fetal surgery vs. no surgery) impact the patient's or family's overall quality of life or ability to perform daily activities."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides detailed information about the fetal surgery procedure for treating spina bifida, but does not explicitly discuss or compare alternative treatment options. It focuses solely on describing the fetal surgery approach without mentioning who may be better suited for this treatment versus other potential treatments, or under what circumstances one would choose fetal surgery over alternatives. While the complexity of the procedure is conveyed, suggesting it may not be appropriate for all cases, the lack of discussion around other treatment choices means the information provided is incomplete in addressing whether there are multiple possible treatment paths. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is given, as the transcript indicates there could be other options by virtue of the invasive nature of fetal surgery, but does not directly describe those alternatives."," 2

The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The only mention of involving the parents in the decision-making process is the following statement:

""All the components of our rather large team meet to discuss the case and then have the parents come in and we go through the entire process once again so that there's a clear understanding of what's involved and give them the opportunity to ask any additional questions.""

This suggests that the parents are informed about the process and given a chance to ask questions, but there is no explicit mention of discussing treatment options or involving the parents in the decision-making process.

The majority of the transcript focuses on describing the surgical procedure itself, with detailed technical information about the various steps involved. While this information is important for the parents to understand, it does not directly promote shared decision-making.

To provide better support for shared decision-making, the transcript could include more explicit statements about discussing the risks, benefits,",set()
Wn2wqi7QbsY,"(bouncy music) - Hi, I'm Karin Muraszko. I'm the Chair of Neurosurgery here at the University of Michigan and what I'd like to talk to you about today is what happens after the baby is born. A child with spina bifida will have life-long issues that will need to be addresses and followed up with doctors in a variety of subspecialties. In the first hours of life, a group of physicians including the neonatologist and neurosurgeons will assess a child in the intensive care unit. The neonatal intensive care unit is generally the place where such children are placed shortly after birth. It's that assessment which helps us decide when and how we're going to take care of the child in the first days of life. So after the baby is born, one of the most important things that we need to make certain of is what we do for all children, which is are there any problems in terms of breathing? Are there any problems in terms of infection? Is their heart working well? And after we get through all of that, the vast, vast majority of children will have no problems in that area, we then are particularly interested as to whether the baby will have the development of hydrocephalus. The repair of the myelomeningocele usually occurs within the first 24 to 48 hours and the decision about whether any kind of diversionary procedure for the cerebral spinal fluid to deal with the hydrocephalus is something which also will be made within the first day or two of life. But in many cases dealing with the hydrocephalus is something which needs to be followed over time and therefore may not be done at the same time as the repair of the myelomeningocele. After that there are other additional things that need to be looked at. The doctors from urology and orthopedic surgery will examine the baby to make certain that the bladder and the bowel functions are okay, that there are no specific problems with how the legs are working or the spine. And the neurosurgeon will be particularly important to look at whether the baby has any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention. If the baby has had a repair of the myelomeningocele in utero then the neurosurgeon will be primarily looking at that repair site to make certain that it's okay and not having any problems. If the baby did not have a repair in utero then that's something that will also be done in the first days of life. The timing of that will depend a little bit on each child. We need to make certain that the baby is safe for an anesthetic and we also need to make certain that we often use our plastic surgery colleagues to help us make certain that there's adequate skin closure in these children. Over the lifetime of a baby they'll be necessary follow-up with each of the specialists I talked about. The neurosurgeon to make certain that the neurologic function continues and that there's no problem. The orthopedic surgeon to make certain that the spine, particularly with respect to scoliosis, and the lower extremities, particularly with respect to how they're formed and how the walking is going. And the urologist because almost all children with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, have problems with their bladder and bowel function that will require the urologist to follow them. Children with myelomeningocele require a multidisciplinary approach to their care. Because the life expectancy of a child with myelomeningocele is really quite good and that we expect them to grow up to be adults and to have normal lives with respect to their disabilities, we also recognize that it's a lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care to achieve the best results for these children. Therefore it's a group of specialists who understand the complexity of myelomeningocele, who'll be taking care of the child, not only as an infant but as a young adult and onwards into full adulthood.",Spina Bifida,4,4,5,2,2,5,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,2," 4

Explanation: The aims of the video are partially clear. The transcript provides an overview of the medical care and follow-up required for babies born with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele. It outlines the assessments and interventions that may be needed in the first few days after birth, as well as the long-term multidisciplinary care that will be required throughout the child's life.

The video transcript does not explicitly cite or reference any specific sources of information or evidence beyond the expertise of the speaker herself, Dr. Karin Muraszko. While she appears to be an authority on the subject matter, being the Chair of Neurosurgery at the University of Michigan, the transcript does not provide references to research studies, expert opinions from other sources, or any other external sources of information. The information presented seems to be based primarily on Dr. Muraszko's professional knowledge and experience in treating children with spina bifida. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that sources of evidence are partially clear, as the expertise of the speaker is evident, but no explicit references to other sources are provided."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide specific dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date mentioned is the timeframe of ""within the first 24 to 48 hours"" for the repair of the myelomeningocele after birth. However, there are no dates given for any other sources of information, such as research studies, guidelines, or publications that may have been referenced in creating the video content. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that only the date of the video itself (indirectly mentioned through the treatment timeframes) is clear, but dates for acknowledged sources are not provided."," 5

This video transcript appears to be balanced and unbiased in providing information about the medical care and management of spina bifida in newborns and children. The information is presented from an objective, medical expert point of view, covering various aspects of care and the involvement of different medical specialists. The video does not seem to promote or favor any particular treatment choice but rather provides an overview of the typical care pathway and considerations for children with spina bifida.

The transcript references the multidisciplinary approach involving specialists from different fields such as neurosurgery, neonatology, urology, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, indicating that a range of sources and expertise were consulted in compiling the information.

It mentions that urology and orthopedic surgery are involved to manage bladder/bowel function and leg/spine issues respectively, but does not describe how their treatments work.

The only somewhat detailed explanation is that multidisciplinary care is required lifelong to manage the various complications and disabilities associated with spina bifida, but again, no specifics are provided on the treatments themselves and how they function.

So while the transcript covers the types of treatments needed, it falls short of clearly describing the mechanisms of action and how each treatment achieves its therapeutic effect on the"," 2

The transcript provides some information about the benefits of certain treatments for spina bifida, but does not comprehensively describe the benefits for each treatment mentioned.

It mentions that repairing the myelomeningocele (the opening in the spine) and potentially performing a procedure to address hydrocephalus (buildup of fluid in the brain) are important initial treatments after birth. However, it does not explicitly state the benefits of these procedures.

The transcript also notes the importance of follow-up care from various specialists like neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and urologists to monitor and address issues related to neurological function, spine/leg development, bladder/bowel function, etc. But again, it does not clearly outline the specific benefits of this ongoing care.

The video provides some information about potential risks and complications associated with treatments for spina bifida, but does not comprehensively describe the risks for each treatment mentioned.

It mentions that the neurosurgeon will assess if the baby has ""any additional problems that require neurosurgical intervention"" after the repair of the myelomeningocele, implying potential complications. It also notes that the timing of the myelomeningocele repair depends on ensuring the baby is safe for anesthesia, suggesting anesthesia risks.

However, it does not explicitly describe risks or potential side effects for other treatments mentioned, such as procedures to address hydrocephalus, urological interventions for bladder/bowel issues, or orthopedic treatments for spine/leg issues.

The video provides some information related to the effects of treatment choices on day-to-day activity and overall quality of life, but the information is incomplete and not explicitly described.

The video mentions that children with spina bifida will have lifelong issues that need to be addressed by various medical specialists, such as neurosurgeons, urologists, and orthopedic surgeons. It also states that these children will require follow-up care throughout their lives to manage neurological function, bladder and bowel problems, spine and lower extremity issues, and other potential complications.

However, the video does not go into detail about how the specific treatment choices or interventions affect the children's overall quality of life or their ability to perform daily activities. While it is implied that proper treatment and management can help these children lead more ""normal lives,"" the direct impact on quality of life is not clearly described.

Therefore, the video partially addresses the question about the effects"," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about potential treatment choices for spina bifida, but it does not clearly describe who is most likely to benefit from each choice or under what circumstances alternatives should be considered. The main focus is on outlining the various medical specialties involved and the need for multidisciplinary care throughout the child's life. While it mentions procedures like repairing the myelomeningocele and addressing hydrocephalus, it does not go into detail about the factors that would guide the decision between different treatment options. The video acknowledges that timing and approach may vary based on the individual child's condition, but it does not explicitly suggest investigating or weighing alternatives before deciding on a particular treatment."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited.

The transcript focuses primarily on explaining the medical procedures, assessments, and follow-up care required for a child born with spina bifida. It emphasizes the involvement of various medical specialists and the need for a multidisciplinary approach throughout the child's life.

However, there are no direct suggestions or encouragement for discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals. The video is primarily informative about the medical aspects rather than promoting shared decision-making explicitly.

The only potential connection to shared decision-making is the mention of a ""lifetime process of working through multidisciplinary care,"" which could imply involving the patient and family in decision-making, but this is not explicitly stated.

Overall, while the video provides useful medical information, it lacks specific recommendations or guidance for engaging in shared decision-making with healthcare providers or support systems",set()

So when you come to CHOP and the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment, you have the benefit of all of that expertise. It's the same team. We've been working with the same people. We're like a finely oiled machine. So for a family who's carrying a fetus with spina bifida, you really want to go to a place that knows very well and has seen all the problems that can occur so that there really are no surprises. Hearing your concerns and being able to answer those questions is incredibly reassuring to families. We'll all face challenges in life, but it's nice to start off without some of those major challenges when you can have science and medicine come together to make the life better. Sean came out with his toes wiggling, kicking and screaming so to speak, and he's been doing that ever since. He runs, he jumps, he plays, he does everything he wants to do. He knows that there's some limitations, but I think he also knows that he's very fortunate. We don't dwell on the spina bifida, but we don't ignore it either. It's part of our lives. It's part of who Sean is, there's no question about that. We are very lucky that his quality of life, and ours, is just incredible. Absolutely incredible. It's wonderful that we can provide families with all these options and give the families the opportunities to learn everything they can about their babies. It takes a team, it takes a multidisciplinary team, working in a very collegial, cooperative, fully integrated way. You could not possibly do this surgery without this kind of a team. And that sort of experience is irreplaceable. It is volume, it's having patients steadily doing this, keeping the team sharp, that's critical to the success of this. It is easy to get excited and be committed when the entire team is committed. I think that's what makes Chopper a really unique place.

D4IciMipYEU,"When a mom first calls our center, either our nurse coordinator or genetic counselor, we'll talk with them about how they first learned about the diagnosis of spina bifida, what tests they've had so far, and their understanding of the diagnosis. They are scheduled for an entire day of diagnostic testing and counseling. The diagnostic process involves radiologic studies, maternal fetal ultrasound that's usually two plus hours in duration in which we look at everything. How big the lesion is, what segments of the spine are involved. They look for the degree of hydrocephaly, evidence for the Chiari malformation, and we look for evidence of paralysis or function of the lower extremities. A fetal MRI that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes and requires the mother to be still inside the MRI chamber. A fetal echocardiogram to look at the fetal heart. Fetuses with myelomeningocele typically do not have any problems that are wrong with the fetal heart. However, as a fetal cardiologist, it's very important to make sure that we're not dealing with any abnormalities whatsoever of the heart, even if they're mild. Part of the evaluation when a family comes to our center is not only the detailed imaging of the fetus, but a careful evaluation of the mother herself. And then we meet with the family to go through the results of those tests and tell them what we know about the diagnosis. The counseling involves a multidisciplinary group. An experienced nurse, neurosurgeon, fetal surgeon, maternal fetal medicine specialist, social worker. This is a team that can provide information to the family, review the results of the tests, and present the options. It was amazing how much information they were able to convey, and we understood it. Very caring and it just made you feel like if they say this is an option for you, it was a potentially great thing for us.

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. The following statements indicate that different options are presented to families, acknowledging the gaps in knowledge and differences in expert opinion concerning the best course of action:

1. ""Families faced with the diagnosis of spina bifida in utero are now able to make choices.""
2. ""Many families after hearing the range and potential severities of the disabilities and problems these children face choose to terminate the pregnancy.""

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain diagnostic tests and procedures work (e.g., ultrasound to look at the size of the lesion, MRI to visualize structures, echocardiogram to examine the fetal heart), but it does not describe in detail how the actual treatments for spina bifida, such as fetal surgery or conventional post-natal treatment, work to achieve their effects on the body or condition. The transcript mentions that fetal surgery can ""change the natural history of the disease,"" but does not elaborate on the mechanisms by which it does so. Therefore, while it partially covers how some diagnostic processes work, it does not adequately describe how the treatments themselves work, warranting a score of 2."," 3

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It does not explicitly state the benefits of each treatment option, but provides some insight into how the different treatment paths may impact the condition.

For the fetal surgery option, it mentions that it ""really does change the natural history of the disease as we knew it before,"" implying potential benefits over the conventional treatment approach.

However, it does not clearly articulate the specific benefits of the conventional treatment approach of delivering the baby and performing surgery/shunt placement after birth.

The transcript focuses more on describing the diagnostic process and counseling provided to families, rather than detailing the benefits of each treatment choice. Some benefits are hinted at, but not comprehensively covered for all options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It states that families are informed about ""the range and potential severities of the disabilities and problems these children face,"" which implies that risks and complications are discussed.

The focus is more on explaining the diagnostic process and presenting the available treatment options. While quality of life considerations are alluded to, the impacts of the different treatments on quality of life are not explicitly described."," 5

The video makes it very clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It explicitly mentions three options:

1. Terminate the pregnancy.
2. Stay at the hospital and receive conventional treatment after delivery, which involves closing the back and inserting a shunt if necessary.
3. Pursue fetal surgery, which can change the natural course of the disease.

The video describes the diagnostic process and counseling involved to help families understand the diagnosis, severity, and potential disabilities, before presenting these three treatment options. It suggests that families can make an informed choice after going through this process and understanding the implications of each option. The video clearly lays out the different choices available and does not present just one course of treatment."," 3

The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is not very explicit or detailed.

Pros:
- It mentions that families are presented with options and choices regarding treatment after receiving information and counseling from a multidisciplinary team.
- It implies that families can discuss and weigh the potential risks/benefits with medical professionals before making a decision.

Cons:
- There are no direct suggestions or encouragement for patients to discuss options with family, friends, or medical team members.
- The focus is more on describing the diagnostic process and available treatments rather than emphasizing shared decision-making.
- It does not provide specific details on how shared decision-making is facilitated or what kinds of discussions should take place.

gwSUxO8ahIU,"Our journey began back, I guess, in 2013. We found out we were pregnant with twins, so I was high risk. So we went to a specialist to have an ultrasound and one of the twins had passed and then I can remember the doctor just doing the ultrasound over Emerson to make sure everything looked good. He was taking a bit longer than I had expected, so I finally asked him, I said, is everything okay? And he said, you know, I'm looking at her head and he said, I'm seeing some signs that are indicative of spina bifida. And he said, he showed me the shapes on the ultrasound and he said her head, her brain is in the shape of a lemon and then he also said the cerebellum was in the shape of a banana and he said those are two classic signs of spina bifida. So when you hear that, it's, oh my gosh, that's devastating news. Through my anxiety and fear, I just asked him what does spina bifida mean for her? And he said, it means that she will probably never walk. It's a birth defect where the back is open. She will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life. It was heart-wrenching at that time. It was a bad day, especially for my wife. You know, when you lose a child due to miscarriage and then get this diagnosis. So I immediately started researching that when we got home and that's when we found out about the fetal center here at Texas Children's. We were able to come in and do the qualification process, which is a two-day process. It was very, very intense, met with so many physicians, surgeons. It was a long day. When the patient is coming to us with a diagnosis of neuro tube defect, first we have a comprehensive evaluation of the fetus. The patient will have the fetal MRI ultrasound. The patient will have a meeting with our pediatric surgeons, with our pediatric neurosurgeons, and with the fetal intervention team. And the way that we are approaching is we say the standard for the care at this point is open fetal surgery. And then we also offer the experimental technique that we innovate in the Texas Children's Hospital as a phytoscopy neuro tube defect. We knew going in that if we were a candidate, we were going to do the surgery no matter what. We just wanted to give the best opportunity at life and the best opportunity for Emerson to have the best life that she could. If we can close this defect at the time that the baby is inside the womb, the baby will have a better benefit regarding of the need of the ventricular amniotic shunt. That means it significantly decreases the numbers, and also it will preserve the lower extremity movement. That means many of these babies can walk independently after the surgery. The team here at Texas Children's made the decision a lot easier for us. There's just so much confidence in the room. Even though we were only the 16th couple to have the surgery here, they just gave us a lot of confidence and the level of service and care was unlike anything we had ever seen from a hospital or a doctor's office. Surgery day was scary. I remember we had surgery the day after Christmas. First Dr. Belfort came out and said, we've got the baby positioned, everything's going fine. And then a little while later, Dr. Belfort and Dr. Shammey came out and said, Dr. Whitehead's now repairing Emerson's back. Everything went really, really well. So I was very relieved. Dr. Shammey said, today's the day. Baby Emerson is coming. And we're like, oh gosh. So we called all of our family and said, Emerson, they're about to take me back. She's going to be delivered today. And everybody said, is this an April Fool's joke? Are you kidding? I said, no, it's not an April Fool's joke. She's actually coming today. So she was born on April 1st, 2014. We were coming twice a year, but as Emerson progressed and has gotten better and the outcome has been really far exceeding what our expectations were, we only have to come once a year now. The care team here at Texas Children's, the Spina Bifida Clinic is wonderful. We go one day, it's a long day, but we get to see every single specialty. You know, one of the amazing things about the Spina Bifida program at Texas Children's is that we take a comprehensive approach to patient care. So our program provides care for families across the lifespan, as I mentioned, but also divided by subspecialties. So when a family comes to our center, they're able to see neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, any other subspecialty that is related to their condition specific or their need. She likes Spina Bifida Clinic. She gets to meet new friends. The doctors get to see her grow. They're amazed by her progress. Her parents have done an amazing job at following up in our program and doing everything that they can to assure that outcomes are lasting and positive. As she heads into the school years, I think her prognosis is second to none. She's a mess. She loves to run and jump and play and swim. Very spunky.

It mentions that the doctors discussed the standard open fetal surgery as well as an experimental technique called ""phytoscopy neuro tube defect"" that was being innovated at Texas Children's Hospital. The parents were presented with these two options and had to make a decision on which treatment to pursue for their child. The transcript states that they ultimately chose to go ahead with the surgery, whichever option was recommended, in order to give their child the best opportunity for a good quality of life. However, the discussion of the two different surgical approaches highlights the uncertainty and differing expert opinions that existed at the time regarding the optimal treatment choice for spina bifida cases."," 3

The transcript provides some details on how the treatments for spina bifida work, but the descriptions are not comprehensive for all the treatments mentioned.

For the fetal surgery, it explains that closing the defect in the womb can help preserve lower extremity movement and reduce the need for a shunt later on. This gives some insight into how the treatment aims to improve outcomes.

However, for other treatments like the comprehensive care approach involving different subspecialties, there are no specifics provided on how each component (e.g. neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics) acts on the body or condition.

The score of 3 reflects that some useful details are given about the mechanisms of the fetal surgery treatment, but the transcript lacks clear explanations for how the other treatments work to address spina bifida. The information provided is therefore partially complete in addressing the question."," 5

The transcript provides a detailed description of the benefits of the fetal surgery treatment for spina bifida. Some key benefits mentioned include:

1. Decreasing the need for a ventricular shunt to drain excess fluid from the brain.
2. Preserving lower extremity movement, allowing many babies to walk independently after the surgery.
3. Repairing the spinal defect before birth to improve outcomes.
4. The comprehensive, multidisciplinary care approach at Texas Children's Hospital to manage spina bifida across the lifespan.

The parents specifically note that Emerson's outcome has ""far exceeded"" their expectations thanks to the fetal surgery and follow-up care. Her ability to run, jump, play and swim is highlighted as a positive outcome.

Overall, the transcript clearly outlines the significant benefits of pursuing fetal surgery and comprehensive care for managing spina bifida, both in the short-term"," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It provides some details about the risks and potential complications associated with spina bifida itself, such as paralysis, brain damage, and poor quality of life. However, it does not explicitly mention the risks or side effects of the specific treatments discussed, which are the fetal surgery and the experimental fetoscopic neurotube defect repair. While it mentions potential benefits of these procedures, like reducing the need for a ventricular shunt and preserving lower extremity movement, no specific risks or complications of the surgical interventions themselves are described."," 2

The transcript partially describes what would happen if no treatment is used for spina bifida. It mentions that the doctor initially said Emerson ""will probably never walk"" and that she ""will have paralysis, she will have brain damage, she will have a poor quality of life"" if left untreated. However, this is just a brief mention, and the majority of the transcript focuses on the decision to undergo fetal surgery and the positive outcomes of that treatment. There is no detailed discussion of the specific risks and benefits of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The information provided about the consequences of no treatment is limited."," 4

The transcript partially covers how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but the information is not very detailed or clear.

It mentions that before the fetal surgery, the doctor told the parents that with spina bifida, their child ""will have a poor quality of life."" This suggests the untreated condition would severely impact quality of life.

It also states that after the fetal surgery at Texas Children's, Emerson's outcome ""has been really far exceeding what our expectations were."" And her prognosis going into school years is described as ""second to none."" This implies the fetal surgery treatment greatly improved her expected quality of life.

However, there are no specific details given about how exactly her day-to-day activities or abilities were affected by having spina bifida versus after the fetal surgery correction. The impacts on overall quality of life are only vaguely referenced.

So while it touches on quality of life related to"," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It mentions two potential treatments: open fetal surgery and fetoscopic neuro tube defect repair. However, the details provided about who would benefit most from each choice and under what circumstances are limited. The video focuses more on the specific case of Emerson and the decision made by her parents to undergo open fetal surgery at Texas Children's Hospital. While it suggests that open fetal surgery can improve outcomes like the need for a shunt and the ability to walk, it does not explicitly compare the two treatment options or provide clear guidance on how to choose between them for different cases. Overall, the video indicates there are multiple treatment choices, but the information on selecting the appropriate choice is somewhat lacking."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, suggesting that the parents were involved in discussions with medical professionals about treatment choices for their daughter's spina bifida.

Key points that indicate shared decision-making:

1. The parents researched and found the fetal center at Texas Children's Hospital after receiving the initial diagnosis.
2. The parents went through an intensive two-day qualification process, meeting with various physicians, surgeons, and the fetal intervention team.
3. The medical team explained the standard treatment (open fetal surgery) and the experimental option (fetoscopic surgery) they innovated.
4. The parents stated that they decided to proceed with surgery, whichever option was available, to give their daughter the best opportunity.
5. The medical team provided comprehensive care and follow-up, involving various subspecialties to address the child's needs.

qPmzl95kOpo,"Our goal with fetal surgery repair for spina bifida is to get the mother to 37 weeks. Babies who undergo fetal surgery tend to be born prematurely and in the MALMS trial they were born at an average gestational age just beyond 34 weeks, but 10% were born at 30 weeks or prior to that time which is quite premature. Over 65% of them get past that 35 week mark and then it becomes a matter of timing of delivery. We've made an incision in the uterus that is not in a safe part of the uterus to allow the woman to labor in any pregnancy going forward. So the baby is delivered via a cesarean section in the special delivery unit. The special delivery unit was built for the mother carrying a baby with a birth defect, was built for the mother carrying a baby with spina bifida. We as the resuscitation team feel like we are very prepared for those deliveries. We have excellent communication with the obstetricians and we have access to all their prenatal imaging. We know those babies very well and we coordinate their delivery and their care. Dr. Johnson delivered Sean. He came out very healthy, 6 pounds 7 ounces. Which was a very good size for a child that's born at 36 and a half weeks. He was a big boy. We always make a point of bringing the baby to the mother prior to bringing the baby down to the NICU so that the mother and father and any relatives that they want can see the baby. And from there we take the baby straight down to the newborn infant ICU and the moms are close, you know they can come down as soon as they're feeling well and if there's something going on we're able to go straight back up to their unit.

The doctor mentions that one of their jobs is to ""make sure that mothers have every option available to them"" and ""to educate them, to advise them, to help them so that whatever choice the mother and the family makes is the right one for them."" This suggests that there are multiple options or choices available for the treatment of spina bifida.

However, the transcript does not provide clear and detailed information about the specific treatment choices, who is most likely to benefit from each choice, or under what circumstances each choice might be recommended. The information about treatment choices is relatively vague and incomplete."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While it mentions that one of the jobs of the center is to ""make sure that mothers have every option available to them"" and ""to educate them, to advise them, to help them so that whatever choice the mother and the family makes is the right one for them,"" it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The focus seems to be more on the emotional impact of the diagnosis and the center's role in providing information and support to the mothers and families. However, the concept of shared decision-making is implied in the statement about helping the mothers and families make the right choice for them.",set()
jlDZA2PNW2o,"The term “spina bifida” comes from the latin “split spine,” which is actually a pretty good description, because spina bifida is a birth defect where the tissue on the left and right side of the back that normally come over the spinal cord to protect it, don’t completely meet up to form a nice seal, leaving behind various degrees of an opening right down the middle of the lower back. Very early on in fetal development, the ectoderm, which is the outer layer of the fertilized egg, starts to develop a bit of a ridge that eventually becomes the neural tube. This neural tube goes on to become the spinal cord, the brain, as well as tissues that enclose and protect them, called the meninges, and spina bifida occurs when a portion of this neural tube fails to close properly, typically in the lower back. This constitutes a defect or absence of the vertebral arches due to failure of mesoderm to organize over the region of the defect, and it may or may not involve the underlying meninges and neural tissue. Alright so there are three main types of spina bifida, the first is myelomeningocele, also called meningomyelocele, and this is the most severe of the three and occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding meninges protrude out of an opening in the bony vertebrae and are held together by a sack of skin that pouches out from the back. In really severe cases, there is no skin at all, and the nerves of the spinal cord are therefore exposed, a condition called ‘open spina bifida, and this can cause serious damage to the exposed nerves as well as risk an infection, resulting in symptoms like loss of sensation or paralysis in the areas of the body below the damaged site, bladder or bowel movement problems, seizures, as well as leg and foot deformities. Now a myelomeningocele is typically associated with a condition called an Arnold Chiari II malformation, which is where cerebellar and brainstem tissue slip down into the foramen magnum—the opening at the base of the skull. This Arnold Chiari II malformation results in a variety of symptoms related to the cerebellum and often resulting in hydrocephalus—an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Alright the second type of spina bifida is meningocele, sometimes called a meningeal cyst. In this condition, the prenatal spinal deformities result in only the meninges (and not the spinal nerves) slipping into the gaps between the deformed vertebrae. This one’s the least common form of spina bifida, and because the spinal cord itself is not damaged, these individuals often do not experience the severe symptoms that are seen in myelomeningocele. Alright the third type and finaly type is spina bifida occulta, and this is the most common and most mild form of spina bifida. In fact, ‘occulta’ is latin for hidden, which is appropriate since many of the normal prenatal tests used to diagnose spina bifida don’t catch the disorder because the deformities in the tissues of the lower back are tiny. In spina bifida occulta, the spinal cord and surrounding tissue don’t protrude, nor is any of the tissue forced into the spaces in between the vertebrae. Since the spinal nerves are undamaged, people with this form of the disorder are often asymptomatic, and the condition is usually only found accidently later in life. At most, people might have hair, a dimple, or birthmark on their back above the site of the lesion. Now, the exact cause of all three types of spina bifida isn’t known, but there are known risk factors like folate or Vitamin B9 deficiency during fetal development. Therefore prenatal vitamins include folic acid, which is the manufactured form of folate. The developmental deformities, though, that cause spina bifida often take place in the fourth week of pregnancy (which is 21-28 days) and this could be before a woman might know she’s even pregnant, and therefore she’s not taking prenatal vitamins yet. To help combat this, enriched grain products like breakfast cereals made with whole grains have folic acid added to flour as a general preventative measure. Other risk factors for having a child with spina bifida include obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism like certain anti-seizure medications. Diagnosis for the most severe form of spina bifida—myelomeningocele—is often done prenatally by looking for an increased level of alpha fetoprotein (or AFP) in the mother’s serum, which can happen when the skin surrounding the fetus’s spine is missing and AFP leaks into the amniotic fluid and into the mother’s bloodstream. AFP, though, can be elevated by other conditions as well so in order to get a more exact diagnosis, additional blood tests for Human chorionic gonadotropin (or HCG), inhibin A, and estriol, as well as an ultrasound are usually done. In more serious cases, amniocentesis (where a sample is taken directly from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus) can be performed. For treatment, prenatal surgery is done to close a myelomeningocele, but this surgery can be dangerous to the developing fetus as well as the mother. In cases where postnatal surgery is chosen, it is often done within the first few days of an infant's life in order to minimize the risk of infection like meningitis. Even if the surgery is successful, people with this condition typically need additional interventions such as urinary catheterization to help with urination and crutches or wheelchairs in case of paralysis or low muscle tone, because the damaged or underdeveloped spinal nerves can’t be repaired. Alright, as a quick recap, the three types of spina bifida are spina bifida occulta, which is the most common and least severe, meningocele, which is the least common and also typically not very severe, and myelomeningocele, which is the most severe form of spina bifida.

6Ii_v3t9hpU,"Spina bifida, or its most severe form, myelomeningocele, is the most common central nervous system or neurologic birth defect in the world. Myelomeningocele is a defect in the spine. It's failure of the spinal cord to close. The spinal cord, or the neural tube as the embryologists say, forms very early in gestation, certainly before eight weeks gestation. And spina bifida is thought to be a failure of the formation and closure of that neural tube, so that the spinal cord elements are exposed to the intrauterine environment. It's a progressive process, it's a progressive injury, so that by the end of pregnancy there's been direct traumatic injury to the spinal cord, and there's been injury from the amniotic fluid itself. Because of changes in pressure and fluid flow, babies are also at risk for developing hydrocephalus. Which is a fluid buildup on the brain, and which damages the developing brain. Virtually every child with myelomeningocele or spina bifida has an Arnold-Chiarri malformation on x-ray. And what it is, is that the back part of the brain, called the cerebellum, that has a lot to do with control of motor movements, is wedged down into your neck. The cerebral spinal fluid that cushions the brain and cushions the spinal cord leaks out through the back through the open spina bifida defect. That leads to the back part of the brain getting summed down into the upper part of the spinal canal. That in turn can block the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the brain, because the fluid is produced in the brain and then there's no way for it to circulate beyond that blockage point. So if there is a blockage in the flow of that fluid, then the water builds up inside the ventricle. So you've probably heard the term water on the brain. The water isn't on the brain, it's inside the brain. If you don't treat that, then you end up with a massively enlarged head, you die, or you end up with severe mental retardation. So in order to minimize that ongoing damage of pressure from the fluid, the pediatric neurosurgeon places a shunt tube. It's a simple device. This is a shunt. It's made out of silicone. This end goes through a hole in the back of the head into the water cavity and tunnels down under the skin and goes into the abdomen, which is able to absorb the fluid. It's not a cure. It treats the symptom. It doesn't treat the disease. Once you have a shunt, there are multiple complications that can arise from it. The shunt can become infected, which is a serious complication, because then the brain and the layers in the brain can become infected with meningitis and sephalitis. And with each bout of infection, that can affect the brain function. And then, of course, there are mechanical problems. They clog, they break, they get to be too short, they migrate. So it's not unusual for a child with spondabifida who has a shunt to require that shunt, and not only for life, but to have that shunt changed at least five or six times during the course of their life. It's important for parents to understand the potential complications or ramifications of spondabifida after the diagnosis is made. A child may experience difficulty with apnea, forgetting to breathe. They may also have breathing problems, choking, blue spells. In the worst case, you end up with a child who's on a ventilator with a tracheostomy and a tube in the stomach to eat. And that is a huge impact on your quality of life. Apnea can cause paralysis in the lower extremities that can interfere with the baby's ability to walk or they may even be wheelchair dependent. They also have difficulty with their bowel and bladder function. Most of these kids, when they become older, have to catheterize or else they have to wear diapers. They can develop significant curvatures of the spine because of instability, bony instabilities of the spine if they have a high lesion. Because of the lack of innervation to the feet and the ankles, there can be the formation of club feet or the medical term is telopes as a consequence. So that requires orthopedic intervention after birth. And then there are problems that can come on later on in life. It's not even necessarily done when you're a baby. You can get tethered cord, which means that the nerve tissue gets caught up in scar tissue and you can lose function. So it's a lifelong issue of disability.",Spina Bifida,5,4,5,3,2,2,1,5,3,3,2,5,3,4,2," 5

The transcript is highly relevant and provides detailed information about spina bifida, its causes, complications, treatments, and potential lifelong impacts. It addresses various questions readers might have about this birth defect, such as:

- What is spina bifida and what causes it?
- What are the potential complications and associated conditions?
- How is spina bifida treated, particularly the hydrocephalus aspect?
- What are the potential long-term effects and disabilities associated with spina bifida?
- What kind of medical interventions and ongoing care may be required?

The video transcript provides some general information and explanations about spina bifida, its causes, symptoms, complications, and treatments. However, it does not explicitly cite or reference specific sources for the information presented, such as research studies or expert opinions.

The transcript appears to be a narration by a medical professional or expert who is drawing from their own knowledge and experience in discussing the topic. While the information seems credible and aligns with general medical understanding of spina bifida, the lack of direct references to external sources makes it difficult to verify the accuracy or currency of specific details or claims.

Therefore, I would give a score of 3, indicating that the sources of evidence are partially clear. While the narrator seems knowledgeable, the lack of explicit citations or references to support the information presented means that the sources are not fully transparent."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. The only date mentioned is a general reference to the formation of the neural tube occurring ""certainly before eight weeks gestation."" However, there are no specific dates or years given for any studies, research papers, or other sources that may have been consulted to gather the information presented in the video. Therefore, I can only give a score of 2, indicating that the dates of the sources are partially clear, with only the general timeframe of neural tube formation being specified."," 2

Explanation:

The transcript presents a detailed and factual overview of spina bifida and the associated medical complications and treatments. However, it primarily focuses on the challenges, risks, and potential negative outcomes of the condition, without providing a balanced perspective on the potential for positive outcomes or quality of life with proper management and support.

While the information is presented in a straightforward and informative manner, it lacks a discussion of alternative treatment options, potential variations in severity, or the experiences of individuals living with spina bifida. The transcript does not reference specific research studies or expert sources, relying instead on a general medical overview.

Overall, while the information is medically accurate, the narrow focus on the negative aspects of spina bifida and the lack of counterbalancing perspectives or sources make the presentation somewhat unbalanced and potentially biased towards portraying the condition in a predominantly negative light."," 1

Explanation: The provided transcript does not mention any additional sources of support or information related to spina bifida or myelomeningocele. The transcript is a detailed explanation of the medical condition itself, its causes, symptoms, complications, and treatments, but it does not suggest any further reading materials or provide details of other organizations that could offer advice and information on this topic."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. Specifically, it mentions that the shunt treatment for hydrocephalus ""is not a cure"" and ""treats the symptom"" but ""doesn't treat the disease."" It also discusses the potential complications and ongoing issues that can arise from having a shunt, such as infections, mechanical problems, and the need for multiple shunt replacements throughout life. The transcript acknowledges the significant impact and lifelong disability that spina bifida can have, even with treatment, highlighting the uncertainties and limitations of current treatment options."," 3

Explanation:
The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments work, but lacks clear explanations for others. Specifically:

- It describes how a shunt works to drain excess fluid from the brain and the potential complications that can arise with shunts (infection, clogging, breaking, etc.). This gives details on how this treatment acts on the body.

- However, it does not provide clear mechanistic details on how other treatments like orthopedic interventions for clubfoot, catheterization for bladder issues, or spinal surgery for tethered cord work to achieve their effects. These are just mentioned as treatments without explaining their mechanisms of action.

So while it goes into good detail for the shunt treatment, the lack of similar mechanistic details for the other mentioned treatments means it only partially meets the criteria of describing how each treatment works. Hence, I've given a score of 3 to reflect this partial fulfillment"," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of some treatments for spina bifida. It explains that a shunt is used to treat the buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) by draining the excess fluid, though it notes that this ""is not a cure"" and ""treats the symptom"" rather than the underlying condition. The transcript also mentions that orthopedic intervention may be required to correct clubfoot deformities. However, it does not explicitly describe benefits for any other treatments or interventions."," 2 (Partially)

Explanation:
The transcript describes some risks and complications associated with the treatments for spina bifida, such as shunt infections, shunt malfunctions, and the need for multiple shunt revisions. However, it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects for other potential treatments like surgery to repair the spinal defect or orthopedic interventions for club feet. The risks discussed are primarily focused on complications related to shunt placement and hydrocephalus management."," 5

Explanation: The transcript provides a clear and detailed description of the risks and potential complications associated with not treating spina bifida, specifically myelomeningocele. It outlines the progressive nature of the condition and the potential consequences of not treating hydrocephalus (enlargement of the head, death, or severe mental retardation). The transcript also mentions the lifelong complications and disabilities that can arise without proper treatment, such as paralysis, bowel and bladder dysfunction, spinal curvatures, clubfeet, and tethered cord syndrome. Therefore, the video clearly addresses the risks and potential consequences of not treating spina bifida, meeting the criteria for a score of 5."," 3

The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life related to spina bifida. It mentions some potential impacts on day-to-day activities and functioning, such as being wheelchair-bound, needing a ventilator and feeding tube, difficulty with bowel and bladder control requiring catheterization or diapers, and orthopedic issues like clubfeet. However, it does not explicitly tie these impacts to specific treatment choices or provide a clear, comprehensive overview of how the different treatment options affect overall quality of life. The information is somewhat scattered and incomplete in directly addressing the question."," 4

Explanation:
The transcript provides some indication that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida, but the information is not very clear or comprehensive.

It mentions two main treatment options:
1) Surgical placement of a shunt to drain excess fluid and relieve pressure on the brain. However, it does not discuss alternative treatments or who might benefit most from a shunt.

2) It briefly mentions orthopedic intervention for clubfoot deformities, but again without details on alternatives or specifics on who may need this treatment.

The transcript is focused primarily on describing the condition, complications, and lifelong impacts of spina bifida. While it touches on a couple of treatment options, it does not provide a clear comparison of choices, discussion of who is most suitable for each choice, or suggestions to investigate further alternatives before deciding on a treatment path.

So while it partially indicates there may be treatment choices, the information"," 2

The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making by mentioning the importance of parents understanding the potential complications and ramifications of spina bifida after the diagnosis is made. It also discusses various treatment options and their associated risks and complications, such as the use of shunts, catheterization, orthopedic interventions, and the possibility of being wheelchair-dependent or requiring a ventilator.

However, the transcript does not explicitly suggest discussing these options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. It primarily focuses on providing factual information about the condition and its treatments, rather than encouraging shared decision-making or discussing the treatment choices with others.

To better support shared decision-making, the transcript could include more explicit recommendations for parents to discuss the various treatment options and their potential outcomes with their healthcare team, as well as seeking support from family and friends in making these decisions.",set()

Explanation: The video transcript provides some sources of information, mainly in the form of personal testimonies and experiences from individuals and families affected by spina bifida. However, there are no explicit references to research studies, expert opinions, or other external sources that were used to compile the factual information presented in the video.

The transcript consists primarily of personal accounts, anecdotes, and advice from people living with spina bifida or caring for someone with the condition. While these personal experiences offer valuable insights, the lack of citations or references to medical literature, scientific research, or expert opinions limits the transparency regarding the sources of information used to create the video's content.

Therefore, I would give a score of 3, indicating that the sources of evidence are partially clear, as the personal testimonies and experiences are evident, but there is no explicit mention of external, authoritative sources that may have been consulted or referenced in the video's creation."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide clear dates for the main sources of information used to compile the video. The only date mentioned is ""27 weeks"" in relation to one of the interviewee's pregnancy ultrasound. There are no other explicit dates or time periods given for the other anecdotes, interviews or information presented in the transcript. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as it indicates that only partial date information is provided (in this case, just the 27 week pregnancy reference)."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript presents personal stories and experiences from individuals and families affected by spina bifida, which provides a balanced perspective on living with this condition. The accounts highlight both the challenges and the positive aspects, such as the importance of encouraging independence, participation in everyday activities, and pursuing dreams and aspirations.

However, the transcript does not explicitly reference research studies or expert opinions from medical professionals, apart from a brief mention of a health policy analyst from the CDC. While the personal narratives are valuable, the lack of clear references to scientific sources or a range of expert viewpoints somewhat limits the objective and unbiased nature of the information presented.

Overall, the transcript appears to be largely balanced in its approach, offering a range of perspectives and experiences, but could benefit from incorporating more explicit references to medical research and expert opinions to further enhance its objectivity and balance."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to spina bifida. It is a collection of personal stories and experiences from individuals and families affected by spina bifida, but there are no suggestions for further reading or references to other organizations providing advice and information about the condition."," 1

The transcript does not seem to refer to any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. The video appears to focus on sharing the personal experiences and perspectives of individuals and families affected by spina bifida, highlighting their resilience, independence, and determination to live a normal life despite the challenges associated with the condition. There is no explicit discussion or mention of uncertainties related to treatment options or differences in expert opinions concerning treatment choices for spina bifida."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments like physical therapy, encouraging independence, and involving the child in their own medical care can help manage spina bifida. However, it does not go into specifics on how these treatments work to achieve their effects on the body or condition. The descriptions remain fairly general or anecdotal. There are no clear explanations of the mechanisms behind the treatments. So while there are partial descriptions of treatments, the details on how they functionally work are lacking."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of some treatments or interventions for spina bifida, but does not explicitly cover the benefits for all of the treatments or interventions mentioned.

The benefits described include:

1. Physical therapy and adapted toys to encourage independence and mobility from a young age (Joshua's case).
2. Involving the child in their own medical care and decision-making to build confidence and self-management skills (Joshua's case).
3. Pushing the child to lead a normal life and not be limited by their condition (Ramu's case).
4. Participating in sports and community activities (Ramu's wheelchair league).

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits of other interventions or treatments that may have been part of the overall management of spina bifida, such as surgeries, bracing, catheterization, or any specific medical treatments. It mainly focuses on the psychosoc"," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes risks or potential complications associated with the treatments or conditions mentioned. While it does not go into explicit detail about side effects or adverse reactions, it alludes to some potential risks or difficulties faced by the individuals with spina bifida. For example, it mentions needing extra care, wearing braces, undergoing surgeries, self-catheterizing, and frequent hospital visits. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the specific risks or complications associated with spina bifida or its treatments. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as it partially addresses risks but does not fully describe them for each condition or treatment mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating spina bifida or postponing/forgoing treatment. The video focuses on sharing the experiences and perspectives of individuals living with spina bifida and their families. While it highlights their resilience and ability to lead fulfilling lives, it does not explicitly discuss what would happen if spina bifida is left untreated."," 2

The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but the information is incomplete or unclear.

While the video discusses the experiences of individuals and families living with spina bifida, it does not provide a clear or comprehensive description of how specific treatment choices impact day-to-day activities or overall quality of life. The focus is more on sharing personal stories and perspectives rather than detailing the effects of different treatment options.

Some relevant quotes that touch on quality of life aspects:

""With Sophie she has a little bit of extra care that we need to take. But other than that she really is just like any other kid.""
""I don't let anything stop me from kicking or punching.""
""We've encouraged Joshua's independence, since he came home from the hospital.""
""From the very beginning we always thought that this spina bifida was just something on the side. We never allowed the spina bifida to come first"," 4

Explanation:
The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida, but the information is not very clear or comprehensive. While it does not explicitly discuss different medical treatments, it shows how different families approach caring for and raising children with spina bifida in various ways, suggesting there are choices in how to manage the condition. However, it does not provide detailed descriptions of who might benefit most from specific approaches or give suggestions for evaluating alternative treatment options before deciding. The focus is more on the personal experiences and attitudes of the families rather than laying out multiple defined treatment pathways. So while choice is implied through the diverse experiences shown, the video does not directly address evaluating different medical treatment choices."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making. It highlights the importance of involving the patient (especially children with disabilities) in their own medical care and treatment decisions. Examples include:

- Joshua being required to write his own questions before medical appointments and being involved in self-catheterization from a young age.
- Ramu mentioning that he now goes to his own doctor's appointments and manages his medical issues independently.
- The parents encouraging independence and involving their children in managing their conditions.

However, there are no explicit suggestions about discussing treatment options with family, friends, or health professionals. The focus is more on building self-advocacy skills in the patients themselves. So while it supports shared decision-making to some extent by empowering patients, it does not directly address the aspect of discussing choices with others. Hence, a score of 4 (Partially supporting shared decision-making) is appropriate.",set()
bLnYzCcTEEA,"In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is usually done between 20 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. The womb is then open to expose the back of the fetus using a specially designed staple to control bleeding. The tissue over the defect is then opened and removed. Next, the spinal cord is free from surrounding tissue before it is protected using the Dura. We then close the muscle layers over the defect to further protect the spinal cord. The skin of the fetus is then closed over the defect. If a fetus does not have enough tissue on its back for primary closure, we will repair the spinal defect using patches as shown here. First, we protect the spinal cord by suturing a patch over it before we lay down a second patch to reinforce the repair. We then close the large skin defect using a piece of skin substitute to complete the repair. We then close the womb and conclude the surgery by closing the mother's incision. Ideally, the pregnancy is continued until 37 weeks gestation before the baby is delivered by c-section.",Spina Bifida,4,5,4,2,2,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides a detailed description of the surgical procedure for repairing spina bifida in a fetus. However, it does not explicitly state the aims or objectives of the video at the beginning. The aims can be inferred from the content, which seems to be demonstrating and explaining the prenatal repair process for spina bifida. Nevertheless, a clear and concise statement of the video's aims or purpose would have made the objectives more explicit. Hence, a score of 4 (Partially) is appropriate, as the aims are not directly stated but can be deduced from the context."," 5

The video transcript provides a clear and detailed explanation of the prenatal repair procedure for spina bifida, covering all the key aspects one would expect from a description of the aims.

asl-c1zmHmk,"(soft music) - Spina bifida is a fairly common birth defect that occurs in one to two out of every 1000 live births. What normally should occur early in fetal development or the development of your baby is the neural tube. Starts off as a flat plate of cells, and then around six weeks into development, that flat plate zips itself closes and forms the neural tube. Inside that tube, the nerves from our brain run down to our limbs, so to our arms and to our legs, and the neural tube forms a protective barrier so that those delicate nerves don't get damaged. In cases of spina bifida, also known as a neural tube defect, what happens is that zipping process doesn't go quite right and there can be a gap in the neural tube that allows those delicate nerves to come out of the body, usually out of the skin and they're damaged, as, in exposure to the amniotic fluid. When there is damage to those nerves when the babies are born, we do surgery to repair the opening, but the nerves have usually already suffered some damage. As a result, people or babies with spina bifida or children with spina bifida usually have some degree of paralysis or the inability to use their legs to some extent. So some people with spina bifida will undergo surgery and have a limp or need some sort of help with bracing. Other people with spina bifida will use a wheelchair, so there's some degree, but usually no matter when we are able to do surgery, there's some damage to those nerves. Spina bifida can happen in any pregnancy to any woman. We know there are some risk factors that can make a pregnancy at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida and those include moms who are diabetic, when there's been a family history of other individuals with a neural tube defect, or some women on certain medications. But most of the time, spina bifida happens in a pregnancy where we didn't know there was a higher risk, and that's why we talk so much about folic acid. Folic acid is a B vitamin that we know helps reduce the incidence of spina bifida. Usually people get folic acid in their diet, but we recommend that any woman of any childbearing age take a vitamin that has 0.4 milligrams of folic acid. Because that neural tube closes so early in pregnancy, sometimes a neural tube defect has formed before a woman even knows she's pregnant. For women that we identify that are at higher risk to have a baby with spina bifida, we'll typically recommend more folic acid so it's a good idea to talk to your OB if you're considering having a baby and think you have any risk factors that would increase the risk for this birth defect.",Spina Bifida,5,4,5,3,1,4,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,3,3," 5

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the overall quality of life or the effects of treatment choices on day-to-day activities for individuals with spina bifida. The transcript primarily focuses on explaining what spina bifida is, its causes, and the role of folic acid in reducing the risk of this birth defect. While it briefly mentions that individuals with spina bifida may experience paralysis or require assistance such as bracing or wheelchairs, it does not delve into how these conditions or treatments affect their overall quality of life or daily activities."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida, but the information is not very clear or detailed. The video mentions that some people with spina bifida may undergo surgery and have a limp or need bracing, while others may use a wheelchair. However, it does not provide a detailed description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances each choice would be appropriate. The video focuses more on explaining what spina bifida is and its causes, rather than exploring the various treatment options in depth. While it acknowledges that there may be different levels of paralysis and mobility limitations, it does not delve into the factors that would determine the most suitable treatment approach for individual cases."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. It encourages women to discuss with their OB if they have any risk factors that could increase the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. This suggests that women should have a conversation with their healthcare provider about their individual circumstances and treatment options.

However, the video primarily focuses on providing educational information about spina bifida, its causes, and the role of folic acid in prevention. It does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices or involving family and friends in the decision-making process.

While the recommendation to consult with an OB for those at higher risk promotes shared decision-making to some extent, the video could have provided more specific advice on engaging in discussions with healthcare professionals and loved ones about various treatment options and considerations.",set()
YG4nrRnAlcc,"Decatur was actually brought to our attention before she was actually born. We knew that she had a fairly large myelomeningocele or what most people would understand as spina bifida. The spinal cord is open. If your spinal cord is open, that means your cerebral spinal fluid, it's all in communication with the outside world. So the biggest risk at that point is they can get an infection. If they get an infection, that's meningitis and that's very serious in a baby. But what we aim to do is close the skin, create a barrier between the outside world and the spinal fluid and therefore prevent an infection. Reach in with this forcep and grab the white band. Over time, it became obvious that Decatur was not actually going to be able to get away without needing a BP shunt. We follow the child's head circumference and if the head grows inappropriately, which is a sign of fluid under pressure, then we make arrangements to place a ventricular perineal shunt, which is the treatment for hydrocephalus. People who have hydrocephalus, they don't absorb the fluid, although they continue to make it. Yeah, I'll take a couple more of those and then some derma bond. So you need to move it somewhere else. So the shunt is basically plumbing to move the fluid from the brain down to the abdomen where it's ultimately reabsorbed into the bloodstream, just like it would be in the normal situation in the head. It looks good. And then once she finally got to the point where she had stabilized, was eating well, we were actually able to get her home at that point. There's our beautiful baby. We're enjoying her home right now.

It explains that closing the spinal cord opening helps ""create a barrier between the outside world and the spinal fluid and therefore prevent an infection."" However, it does not explicitly mention the benefits of the ventricular peritoneal shunt for treating hydrocephalus, other than stating that it is ""the treatment for hydrocephalus"" and moves the fluid from the brain to the abdomen. No specific benefits of the coordinated care approach are described either."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It explains the risk of infection if the spinal opening (myelomeningocele) is not closed, which necessitates the surgical closure procedure. However, it does not explicitly mention any risks associated with the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement for treating hydrocephalus, which is another treatment discussed.

While the video highlights the need for a VP shunt when the head circumference grows inappropriately due to fluid buildup, it does not describe the potential risks or complications of this procedure. Shunt surgeries carry risks such as infection, obstruction, overdrainage, and the need for future revisions.

Therefore, since the transcript addresses the risk of one treatment (surgical closure of the spinal defect) but not the other (VP shunt), a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of postponing treatment, watchful waiting (monitoring without treatment), or permanently forgoing treatment for the condition being described (spina bifida). The transcript focuses on describing the condition itself, the treatments administered (surgery to close the spinal opening and shunt placement for hydrocephalus), and the coordinated care approach, but does not discuss what would happen if these treatments were not provided."," 2

The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that the treatments, such as closing the spinal cord opening and installing a shunt for hydrocephalus, are aimed at preventing serious complications like infection and increased intracranial pressure. However, it does not explicitly discuss the effects of these treatments on the day-to-day activities or overall quality of life for the patient. The transcript focuses more on the medical procedures themselves rather than their impact on the patient's daily functioning or well-being. The only reference to quality of life is a general statement about a coordinated care center helping these kids achieve their ""best outcome,"" but it lacks specific details about how the treatments influence their daily lives."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida and hydrocephalus, but it does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice mentioned or under what specific circumstances. It primarily focuses on describing the procedures and treatments performed on the baby, Decatur, without explicitly discussing alternative treatment options or suggesting further investigation of choices before deciding on a particular treatment.

The video mentions the need for a ventricular peritoneal shunt to treat hydrocephalus in Decatur's case, but it does not compare this treatment to other potential choices or outline the factors that would determine the most suitable treatment option. Similarly, it discusses the procedure to close the spinal cord opening in spina bifida cases, but it does not present alternative treatment approaches or the criteria for selecting the appropriate treatment.

While the video implies that there may be different treatment paths based on the individual"," 2

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The transcript primarily focuses on explaining the medical condition, diagnosis, and treatment procedures for a baby named Decatur who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. However, there are no explicit suggestions or recommendations for the parents to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals.

The only relevant statement is towards the end, where it mentions that a coordinated care center with neurosurgeons and other specialists manages the spina bifida clinic, implying that the parents would be involved in discussions with these healthcare professionals. However, this is not explicitly stated or encouraged in the transcript.

Overall, while the video provides helpful information about the medical condition and treatments, it does not directly promote or emphasize the importance of shared decision-making between patients/families and healthcare providers regarding treatment options.",set()
UrbXyXd7N38,"Carter, I would describe him as strong-willed. That's like the very first thing that comes to mind. He has a lot of personality. He tries to pretend that he's shy and is the complete opposite of that after about 30 seconds. He is Specter and he's compassionate. If I'm not feeling good or if I have a headache the next day he'll say, Mom are you feeling better? And those things stick with him. He is a self-taught gymnast so he loves doing head stands and flips and he tries to flip over the couches and jump off things and jump off stairs and so he is just a big jumper right now so we're really into that. And we love dancing so we will turn music on in the house and we'll dance away right? I am talking about you. Yeah. June 24th we went in for our ultrasound then a doctor came in and she introduced herself and she said I'm a high-risk OB so she said she wanted to take a look and that she thought our child might have what's called spina bifida. Spina bifida is one of the more common birth defects. It's the second most common birth defect that we see in the United States. It results from the spine failing to close very early in pregnancy and it is the level of the lesion or where on the back the defect is present that determines what the level of function will be for that individual child. We met with the maternal fetal medicine team and Dr. Treadwell we met her that day and then she brought up the in utero fetal surgery but we would perform that surgery when you were still pregnant. Before the procedure even happened I had kind of talked to Dr. Treadwell just to get an idea of like what to expect and I said you know is there anyone that I can talk to so I know like what's gonna happen maybe what to pack what you know what to expect once we go home and she said well actually Casey you would be the first one. The Hilton family was the first family that had the in utero spina bifida repair here at Michigan Medicine. When we talk about prenatal surgery for spina bifida what we're literally talking about is opening the woman's abdomen opening up her uterus while she's still pregnant operating on the baby while the baby is still in the uterus closing everything up and trying to continue the pregnancy for an additional 10-12 weeks. We were told originally if he walked that he would have a very hard time with it most likely would be in a wheelchair Carter does have a wheelchair it's in our garage because he doesn't really use it the fact that he is just blown everyone away and is running around our house asking us to chase him um is definitely something that I have to like remind myself hey you know I was told that this might never happen and so if he asked me to chase him around the kitchen then gosh darn it I'm gonna chase him around the kitchen.",Spina Bifida,2,4,5,2,2,4,1,5,2,2,2,1,5,5,5," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about the aims of the video, which seems to be discussing a medical condition called spina bifida and a surgery performed on an unborn baby to treat it. However, the aims are not explicitly stated or clearly laid out. The information is scattered throughout the transcript, making it somewhat unclear what the main focus or purpose of the video is intended to be. A clearer introduction or framing of the video's objectives would make the aims more apparent to the viewer."," 4

The video transcript provides a good amount of information related to its apparent aims of describing spina bifida, the in utero fetal surgery procedure, and the specific case/experience of the family featured. It covers details like:

- Definition and background on spina bifida
- Description of the in utero fetal surgery process
- The family being the first to undergo this procedure at their hospital
- Expectations given to them about their child's potential mobility limitations
- Their child exceeding expectations in terms of mobility

However, there are a few areas where additional details could have been provided to more fully achieve the aims, such as:

- More technical/medical details about spina bifida and the surgery
- Specific risks/complications of the in utero procedure  
- Long-term prognosis and follow-up for the child

Overall though, the core information about spina bifida, the fetal surgery, and this family"," 5

Explanation: The video transcript provides highly relevant information about spina bifida, a birth defect that affects the spine. It discusses the diagnosis, treatment options (including in-utero fetal surgery), and the experiences of a family whose child underwent this procedure. The transcript addresses questions that readers might have about spina bifida, its impact, and the available medical interventions. The personal story of the family adds a human touch and provides insight into the challenges and outcomes associated with this condition. Overall, the information is comprehensive and directly addresses the topic, making it highly relevant."," 2

The video transcript provides some sources of information, such as mentioning that the mother met with the ""maternal fetal medicine team and Dr. Treadwell"" and that they discussed the in utero fetal surgery. However, there are no specific references or citations provided for any research studies or expert opinions that may have been used to inform the information presented in the video. Most of the information appears to be based on the personal experiences and observations of the mother.

While the video mentions some medical terms and procedures like ""spina bifida"" and the fetal surgery, it does not explicitly reference the sources from which this medical information was obtained. Therefore, I would give a partial score of 2, as the sources of evidence are not clearly stated or referenced throughout the transcript."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides the date of the ultrasound (June 24th) and mentions that the Hilton family was the first to undergo the in utero spina bifida repair procedure at Michigan Medicine. However, it does not explicitly state the date or year when this procedure took place or when the video itself was produced. Therefore, while there is some clarity regarding the timing of certain events, there are no clear dates provided for all the main sources of information used to compile the video content."," 4 (Partially balanced and unbiased)

Explanation:
The transcript provides a balanced perspective by including information from medical experts about spina bifida and the fetal surgery procedure. It also presents the personal experience and perspective of the parents, which adds a human element to the information.

However, there are a few potential biases:

1. The focus is primarily on the positive outcomes of the fetal surgery, with limited discussion of potential risks or downsides.
2. The parents' positive outlook and gratitude for their child's progress could introduce some bias in favor of the surgery.
3. There is no explicit mention of alternative treatment options or a comparison of different approaches.

While the transcript covers important medical information from experts and includes personal experiences, it leans towards highlighting the benefits of the fetal surgery without a comprehensive exploration of other perspectives or potential drawbacks. A more balanced approach would include a broader discussion of treatment options, risks,"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details or suggestions for additional sources of support or information related to the topic being discussed (spina bifida and fetal surgery). The transcript appears to be a personal account or testimony from the parents of a child who underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida, but it does not mention any external resources, organizations, or further reading materials."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. Specifically, it mentions that the doctor told the parents that if Carter walked, ""he would have a very hard time with it"" and ""most likely would be in a wheelchair."" However, the mother then expresses surprise that Carter is ""running around our house asking us to chase him,"" which she says is something she was told ""might never happen."" This demonstrates an acknowledgment of the uncertainties and differences in expert opinions regarding the potential outcomes and prognosis associated with the treatment choice of in utero fetal surgery for spina bifida."," 2

Explanation:
The transcript provides some details on how the spina bifida treatment (in utero fetal surgery) works, mentioning that it involves ""opening the woman's abdomen, opening up her uterus while she's still pregnant, operating on the baby while the baby is still in the uterus, closing everything up and trying to continue the pregnancy for an additional 10-12 weeks."" However, it does not describe the mechanism by which this surgery helps treat spina bifida or how it acts on the body to achieve its effects. The transcript mainly focuses on the family's personal experience and background information about spina bifida, rather than providing a detailed explanation of how the treatment works. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as some details about the treatment are provided, but the specifics of how it works are lacking."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It provides some information about the potential benefits of the in utero spina bifida repair surgery, stating that it allowed the child (Carter) to walk and run, which was initially uncertain or unlikely without the surgery. However, no specific benefits are mentioned for other potential treatments or management approaches for spina bifida."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks associated with the treatments mentioned. It provides some details about the risks and potential complications of spina bifida itself, stating that ""it is the level of the lesion or where on the back the defect is present that determines what the level of function will be for that individual child.""

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the risks or potential side effects associated with the in utero fetal surgery that was performed to treat the spina bifida. While it mentions that it involved ""opening the woman's abdomen opening up her uterus while she's still pregnant operating on the baby while the baby is still in the uterus closing everything up,"" it does not go into detail about the specific risks or complications that could arise from such a procedure.

Therefore, while it provides some information about the risks related to the condition being treated, it does not comprehensively cover the risks of the actual treatment itself. Hence, a"," 1

The transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not pursuing treatment (surgery) for spina bifida. It focuses mainly on describing the surgery itself, the child's personality and development after the surgery. There is no mention of what could have happened if they had decided to forgo treatment or do watchful waiting instead of the fetal surgery."," 5

The transcript clearly describes how the treatment choice of in utero fetal surgery for spina bifida affected Carter's overall quality of life, specifically his ability to walk, run, and be physically active. The mother mentions that they were originally told Carter would likely be in a wheelchair and have a hard time walking, but after the surgery, he is ""running around our house asking us to chase him,"" which she has to remind herself was something they were told might never happen. This demonstrates a significant positive impact on Carter's day-to-day activity and overall quality of life due to the treatment choice."," 5

The video makes it very clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida. It mentions two options:

1) In utero fetal surgery: The video describes this as an option where they operate on the baby while still in the mother's womb to try to repair the spina bifida defect. It notes that this was the choice made for Carter.

2) No fetal surgery: The video implies this was presented as an alternative option by stating ""We were told originally if he walked that he would have a very hard time with it most likely would be in a wheelchair."" This suggests they were counseled on the potential outcomes without fetal surgery.

The video highlights that fetal surgery was chosen for Carter because it gave him a better chance at improved mobility and function compared to not having the surgery. However, it acknowledges that without surgery, wheelchair use was a likely outcome discussed. By describing these two treatment paths and"," 5

Explanation: The transcript provides very good support for shared decision-making. It mentions that the family met with the maternal fetal medicine team and the doctor (Dr. Treadwell) to discuss the diagnosis of spina bifida and the option of in-utero fetal surgery. The mother (Casey) also mentions that she talked to Dr. Treadwell to get an idea of what to expect and to see if she could speak with someone who had gone through the same procedure. This shows that the family was actively involved in the decision-making process, discussing treatment options and seeking information from healthcare professionals. The transcript demonstrates a collaborative approach between the family and healthcare providers, which is essential for shared decision-making.",set()
0Gf6o2ZEQkc,"[Fetoscopic spina bifida repair animation] This animation shows a spina bifida repair, done prenatally, using a fetoscopic technique. In this fetus with spina bifida, you can see an opening in the back, with an exposed spinal cord. Prenatal repair is most commonly done between 22 and 26 weeks gestation. Once the mother is under anesthesia, we make an incision in the abdomen to expose the womb. We may use either a transverse incision, shown here . . . or a midline incision, as shown here. This animation shows a transverse incision. After we make the incision and cut through the layer of muscle, the womb is exposed. Ultrasound helps us to confirm the position of the fetus and shows us the best location to place the first port for the surgery. We then expand the amniotic cavity using humidified and heated carbon dioxide, which creates more space for us to do the repair. To enable us to see inside the womb, we insert a camera into the amniotic cavity through the first port. Two additional ports are then placed under direct vision to allow placement of instruments for the repair. We inject a cocktail of pain medication, paralytics and medication to protect the baby’s heartbeat into the gluteal muscle. We then place a stabilization stitch in the baby’s upper back, above the spina bifida. We first open up the sac all the way around the spina bifida defect. Once the sac is completely open, we free the placode, or exposed portion of the spinal cord, from the surrounding tissue. This procedure, which is called untethering, allows the placode to fall back down nicely into the spinal canal. We then raise the skin flap around the defect to loosen up the skin. This will eventually help us form a water tight closure of the spinal defect. To protect the placode, we place a patch into the defect. We anchor the patch on one end to the baby’s back using dissolvable sutures. A second patch is then placed to give additional protection, and again, it is secured with dissolvable sutures. We then close the skin over the spinal defect using dissolvable sutures, when the baby has enough skin to do so. If the defect is too large and we are not able to close the skin, we use a skin patch, forming a water tight closure. The stabilization stitch is removed. The repair is now complete. The ports are removed and the port sites are closed with dissolvable sutures. The amniotic fluid we removed is now replaced with warm fluid, and antibiotics are placed into the amniotic cavity. Finally, we close the mother’s abdominal wall muscle, and then close the skin. Ideally, the pregnancy continues until term, at which point the baby is delivered vaginally if there is no contraindication.",Spina Bifida,5,5,5,2,1,4,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,3,1," 5

The transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the patient expresses feeling safe and well-cared for by the medical team at UC Davis, there is no explicit mention of discussing treatment options or making decisions in collaboration with healthcare professionals, family, or friends.

The transcript focuses primarily on the patient's experience and the positive outcome for their child after receiving treatment at UC Davis. However, it does not provide details on the decision-making process or suggest that the patient actively engaged in shared decision-making with their healthcare team or support system.

To better support shared decision-making, the transcript could have included statements about the patient being presented with different treatment options, weighing the risks and benefits with their doctors, or consulting with family members or support groups before making a decision.",set()
E080qJuHWdQ,"Every year thousands of babies are born with spina bifida. It's a birth defect where the spinal column doesn't close properly, exposing nerves to the environment. Most babies born with spina bifida in the United States have surgery soon after birth. But some children in other countries aren't so lucky. A little boy from Algeria suffered terribly for more than two years until his community helped raise money to send him to Mayo Clinic. Unbearable. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. He had to live with this pain all the time. This YouTube video is not easy to watch. Munim Fershishi was born in Algiers with a severe form of spina bifida. His spinal cord did not close and his nerves that control walking and other functions pushed out into a sac of fluid called a meningocele. He could not walk or even sit. His mother Salima says her son spent the first two years of his life tilted forward on his stomach. He was in pain and doctors didn't do anything. Then the sac on Munim's back broke. He developed meningitis and slipped into a coma. His eyes were closed and he was breathing through a tube. Doctors in Algiers operated on Munim, but it did not help. Then, thanks to donations from the community, Munim was transported to Mayo Clinic. Probably the only reason the child survived, truthfully, for two years was due to the tremendous, obvious love and energy of the mother and the family. Neurosurgeon Frederick Meyer teamed up with other specialists in plastic surgery and pediatrics to customize a treatment plan for Munim. First, they cleared his body of infections. Then, Dr. Meyer opened the skin covering on Munim's spine and put the exposed nerve roots back into the spinal canal. Then, he closed the spinal canal and plastic surgeons closed the skin. No one was sure how Munim would do after surgery. He can move his feet, he moves his legs, he can sit down, he can eat with his own hand. Salima says Munim is without pain. He can play and laugh for the first time. Physical therapists are helping Munim get stronger and walk better than expected. Doctors aren't sure how far Munim will go with physical therapy, whether or not he'll be able to walk unassisted. But now, there's a promise of a full, productive life. He's my life. Munim is only two and a half, but he says when he grows up, he wants to be a surgeon, like Dr. Meyer. Munim's mother says she is overwhelmed by the generosity of people in her community who helped pay for Munim's trip to Mayo Clinic. And she thanks the many people at Mayo who helped her son survive.

-sU7NIB35cA,"(light music)  Finding out that your baby is less than perfect is hard, it really is. Especially that this is our third child. And we've had two healthy pregnancies, no complications whatsoever. It was really shocking for us to find out that anything was wrong. I mean, not that I would, but I didn't feel an different being pregnant, I didn't have any suspicion whatsoever. Spina bifida is so different in the way that it affects each child, so even when you're researching, you have so many possible outcomes.  It was nice that we actually had genetic counseling at that time, but to a certain regard, you kinda feel like you're on an island by yourself at that point. And we were looking for someone to really help us become grounded and know where we were gonna be going in the future.  Doctor Baschat: It's a 4D probe phase.  Doctor Miller: Here, at Johns Hopkins, we put together a new, innovative approach for prenatal surgery for spina bifida, which is much less invasive for the mother.  When you do traditional open fetal spina bifida repair, you also open the uterus with an incision, and that happens in the most vulnerable part of the uterine muscle. Whereas, if you do a fetoscopic repair, then your access to the fetus is minimally invasive and that averts a lot of problems of open fetal surgery.  And gives the opportunity to have a lesser impact, not only on the current pregnancy, but for every future pregnancy that she may have or consider, as well.  So, in cases of spina bifida, the three most common neurological findings are hydrocephalus, which is pressure on the brain, Chiari malformation, and the spina bifida lesion itself. It's important that we address those, and through prenatal closure, we're able to reduce the rates of both hydrocephalus and Chiari very successfully. Here at Hopkins, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I'm involved as one of the first team members that they meet, as part of the fetal therapy team, and I help take care of their child throughout the course of their life.  They really talked about not just the pregnancy and not just the surgery, but then what care would look like for Harper down the line.  The benefits of prenatal surgery for spina bifida are established. When you compare the group of children that have surgery before, fewer children will require a shunt for hydrocephalus after birth. Their motor function will also be improved. We anticipate that after the immediate post-operative period, for women who, their course has been uncomplicated, they can gradually return back towards their normal activity. And that is a major advantage for life.  The idea that I also got to have a vaginal delivery was really, really important to me. My recovery was pretty easy after she was born and that made a huge difference in my ability to be there for her and for my other kids.  Doctor Miller: Because we have such a small core team who's involved in the total care of these patients, any small change, we can observe immediately.  We have regular followup appointments with a lot of doctors, but that's okay. We see neurosurgery every three months, just to keep checking on things and making sure things are going well.  Scott: From her health and the baby's health, we couldn't have asked for anything better from that surgery.  Fetal surgery is hard. It's not an easy decision to make. The quality of life that we expect for Harper is the same quality of life we expect for our other kids.  Child: How many months are her?  Six months.  Six months old.

The video partially outlines its aims, which seem to be about prenatal surgery for spina bifida and the experience of parents who have gone through it. However, the aims are not stated explicitly or comprehensively. The transcript covers several aspects like the diagnosis, surgery process, benefits, recovery, and follow-up care. But it doesn't lay out a clear overarching goal or purpose for the video itself. The aims have to be inferred from the different segments discussed."," 4

The video provides a good overview of the prenatal spina bifida surgery process and outcomes at Johns Hopkins, achieving most of what it seems to aim for. It covers the motivations for considering the surgery, explains the surgical procedure and its benefits compared to traditional open fetal surgery, and discusses the postnatal care and long-term outlook for the child. The parents' personal experiences are included to give a patient perspective.

However, there are a few areas where more detail could have been provided to fully achieve the stated aims, such as more specifics on the surgery's risks/potential complications, recovery timelines, and long-term prognosis statistics. But overall, the core information outlining the prenatal spina bifida surgery and its rationale is comprehensively covered, hence the high score of 4."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about spina bifida, a birth defect that affects the spine, as well as prenatal surgery to treat it. It covers the following points:

1) It explains what spina bifida is and how it can affect children differently.

2) It discusses the innovative fetoscopic prenatal surgery approach used at Johns Hopkins to repair spina bifida in a minimally invasive way.

3) It outlines the benefits of prenatal spina bifida surgery, such as reduced rates of hydrocephalus and improved motor function.

4) It provides insights from doctors involved in the fetal therapy team as well as from parents who underwent the procedure.

5) It touches upon the post-surgery recovery and follow-up care for the child.

While the transcript is primarily focused on the medical aspects and one family's experience, it does address several questions readers might have about spina bifida, the pren"," 2

Explanation: The video partially mentions some sources of information and evidence, but does not provide clear references or citations for many of the main claims or statements made.

The video features interviews with doctors from Johns Hopkins who discuss the prenatal surgery approach and its benefits. Their expert opinions and experience are presented as a source of information. However, no specific research studies or data sources are cited to back up the claims about the benefits of prenatal surgery, such as reduced need for shunts or improved motor function.

Additionally, the parents share their personal experiences and perspectives, which can be considered anecdotal evidence.

Overall, while the video draws from medical expertise at Johns Hopkins, it lacks clear references to external, verifiable sources like published research studies or statistics to support the key claims about the efficacy and outcomes of the prenatal surgery approach. The sources of evidence are only partially clear."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates/timeframes related to the information presented, but does not give clear dates for all acknowledged sources. Specifically:

- No dates are given for the research/information on spina bifida and its effects that is referenced.
- No dates are provided for when the genetic counseling mentioned took place.
- No dates are given for when the innovative prenatal spina bifida surgery approach at Johns Hopkins was developed/implemented.
- The child's age (6 months) is stated, implying the surgery took place around 6 months prior, but no exact date is provided.

The only clear date relates to it being the video itself, with the child being 6 months old at the time of filming. However, dates are lacking for the other sources of information referenced in compiling the video's content. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially clear) is appropriate."," 4

Explanation:

The video appears to be mostly balanced and unbiased in presenting information about prenatal surgery for spina bifida. It covers both the potential benefits and challenges involved, and includes perspectives from medical experts as well as parents who have gone through the procedure.

On the positive side, the video:
- Presents information from multiple sources, including doctors, genetic counselors, and parents
- Discusses the potential advantages of prenatal surgery, such as reduced need for shunts, improved motor function, and easier delivery/recovery for the mother
- Acknowledges the difficulty of the decision and that outcomes can vary

However, there are a couple potential biases:
- It focuses exclusively on prenatal surgery as the treatment option, without discussing potential alternatives or drawbacks in as much detail
- The doctors interviewed are from the same hospital (Johns Hopkins) promoting their innovative procedure, so their perspectives may be somewhat biased towards that approach

Explanation: The video transcript does not explicitly mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for spina bifida. The transcript primarily focuses on describing the innovative prenatal surgery approach for spina bifida repair developed at Johns Hopkins, the potential benefits of this approach, and the experience of one family who underwent this procedure. While it acknowledges that spina bifida can have varying effects on each child, it does not discuss uncertainties or differences in expert opinion concerning the available treatment options or choices. The information provided seems definitive in terms of the recommended prenatal surgery and its advantages over traditional open fetal surgery."," 2

Explanation:
The transcript provides some details on how the prenatal surgery for spina bifida works, such as it being less invasive than traditional open fetal surgery and avoiding making a large incision in the uterus. It also mentions that the surgery aims to reduce rates of hydrocephalus and Chiari malformation.

However, there are no clear descriptions of the specific mechanisms by which the surgery acts on the body to achieve its effects or how it addresses the root causes of spina bifida. The explanations remain fairly high-level without going into physiological or anatomical details.

So while there are some partial descriptions of how the treatment works, the information provided is incomplete and lacks depth in explaining the underlying processes involved.

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for spina bifida, but the information provided is not very clear or complete.

While the video discusses the prenatal surgery option at Johns Hopkins in detail, it does not explicitly mention or compare alternative treatment choices. There is a brief mention of ""possible outcomes"" when researching spina bifida, suggesting there could be different treatment paths, but no alternatives are described in depth.

The benefits of the prenatal surgery are highlighted, but there is no discussion of who may be better suited for this treatment versus other options, or under what circumstances one would consider alternatives. The lack of clear comparison to other treatment choices makes it difficult to definitively conclude that the video portrays spina bifida as having multiple possible treatment paths to explore.

So while the video hints at there potentially being choices, by focusing solely on the prenatal surgery approach without contrasting it with other possibilities, it"," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, doctors or other health professionals. The video focuses on the parents' experience with prenatal surgery for spina bifida and the follow-up care for their child. However, it does mention that they received genetic counseling and that the doctors at Johns Hopkins discussed not just the surgery but also the long-term care for their child.

_FZntuo_W20,"Hello friends, I am Dr. Anurag Saxena, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon and Spine Surgeon at Naranath Superspecialty Hospital, Gurgaon. Today we are going to talk to you regarding Spina Bifida. Spina Bifida is a condition which refers to a developmental defect in the spinal column of the child which means that there are certain areas of the spine of the child, bony spine and neural spine which are not able to form during the development of the child as a fetus. This leads to a defect in the back, it is usually more common in the lower side of the back but this can happen at the other extremity that is in the cervical region or the back of the head also. And this defect leads to a swelling which is called as cystic swelling or meningosil, myosil and sometimes there can be fatty tissues in it and it is called as a lipoma. So broadly Spina Bifida can be divided into two categories, one is called as a Spina Bifida Occulta which means occult or hidden which means that the defect you cannot see from outside and there is a covering of a skin or a fatty tissue over the defect and the other category is called as Spina Bifida Apperta or where it is apparent or where you can see it when there is a defect which is visible or there is a big swelling of a fluid containing sac which is available. The fluid containing sac can be meningosil and myosil which we are going to describe further in this video. We need to know exactly how it happens is it happens because the spine closes like a zip of a cloth when the patient, when the baby is in the womb and during the development this zip like closure of the spinal cord or your spine is sometimes hampered at either end of the spine that is in the upper end or the lower end and this leads to a defect which remains and in this defect certain tissues goes in from like body fat and muscles can go in and sometimes the neural tissues which forms a tube are not able to form a tube and sometimes there can be absence or inactive neural tissues inside this kind of swelling which leads to spina bifida problems. What exactly causes this kind of problems is not known however there is a clear association with deficiency of a vitamin called as folic acid in mothers especially at the time of conception and during the first trimester of the pregnancy. Other causative agents include certain type of drugs and genetic factors also. So if there is a family history, if somebody in the family is suffering from this kind of disease then the chances of one having baby with spina bifida increases as compared to general population. So when the cystic swelling contains only the fluid or the CSF or the cerebrospinal fluid then it is called as a meningosy. When this cavity contains fluid and the neural tissues which can include the spinal cord or nerves then it is called as a meningomyelosy. Because it is a developmental defect then sometimes the babies can have associated developmental problem in the brain like building up of the fluid which is called as hydrocephalus and sometimes they can have problems in their lower feet like club foot. Very rarely these kind of babies can have developmental problem in other organs of the body like heart and gastrointestinal organs. So apart from the swelling in the back or anywhere in the back like from your cervical spine to lower spine, most of the time in the lower spine this swelling is apparent and these patients usually have weakness or less movement of the legs and their control of their urine and bowels is also hampered. Now there are series of diagnostic tests which can be applied before birth. They are called as antinatal diagnostic tests and then there are after the baby is born then there are certain diagnostic modalities like MRI and the treatment largely depends on the type of the spinal bifida. The diagnosis and the treatment will be covered in the next part of this video. Thank you.",Spina Bifida,5,4,5,3,2,4,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1," 5

EU3C20Myax4,"Spina Bifida is a major malformation where the bone of the spine will not cover the posterior part of the nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and the skin on top of this will not close properly as well. This will result in an uncoordinated and disordered development of the nerves into the lower limbs with a afinalistic innervation of the different muscles. It normally consists in a full palsy of the muscles and sometimes in some spasticity of the residual part of those. It is probably due to a lack of folic acid during pregnancy that will not allow the meninges to develop properly. Spina Bifida can have different degrees of malformation, it can also be Spina Bifida Occulta when is not present clinically at birth But some malformation of the vertebrae involved of the spine are present. Treatment of the Spina Bifida includes physiotherapy more frequently but sometimes you need surgery to correct progressive deformity- Life expectancy of Spina Bifida is quite long unless some complication will shorten it like hydrocephalus, infection of the derivation and chest infection or general diseases that can decrease life length. Surgical treatment is mostly orthopedics. Only at birth you need surgical closure of the bony and nerval part of the posterior spine but in the rest of the life hip dysplasia and dislocation deformity of the knee the ankle and the feet will normally touch every patients and they will undergo major surgery for more than once in their life. In my department you need latex free and we have surgical theaters, because they are allergic to latex so patients with spina bifida need a special preparation of the operating room with special instrument. We have a referral center for spina bifida and cerebral palsy in Milan where we perform for spina bifida at least 120 operation per year. I'm always available for any question any doubt or any problem you may have, because I understand as a father that every minimal problem with your kid can become a major disaster in your mind and it's better to have a straight away answer and clarification so you can relax for something that it's normally not important.

RlkrW3AW0ZU,"Open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, affect the spine and spinal cord. Myelomeningocele, or MMC and Myeloschisis are both serious forms of spina bifida and occur when a baby’s spine, spinal cord and spinal canal don’t close as they normally would. Spina bifida occurs in the first three to four weeks of a woman’s pregnancy when the spinal cord is forming. At this point, a baby’s developing brain and spine are referred to as the “neural tube.” Normally, during these first few weeks of development, the two sides of a baby's back fold to form a tube called the spinal cord. If a baby has an open neural tube defect, the neural tube doesn’t close completely, leaving a small gap. This is the defect. With an open neural tube defect such as MMC, the bones of the spine don’t completely form, resulting in an incomplete spinal canal. Because the spinal canal remains open, the spinal cord and meninges protrude from the baby’s back. Babies with MMC-type spina bifida can have a sac protruding from the opening in the spine. This sac may contain: cerebrospinal fluid, nerves, and parts of the spinal cord. At the Colorado Fetal Care Center, MMC is surgically repaired in utero with either an open procedure or the newly developed fetoscopic surgery. During open surgery, an anesthesiologist will put the mother to sleep in order to relax the uterus. The anesthesia passes through the placenta to the unborn child. Then, incisions are made in the abdomen to open the mother’s belly and uterus. The baby’s spine and defect are then exposed. From there, the defect is repaired and the skin of the baby’s back is closed over the opening to protect their still-developing neural tissue. Following open surgery, the baby will be delivered via c- section. The fetoscopic surgery involves opening up the mother’s belly like during the open surgery, but instead of cutting into the uterus, tiny incisions are made and instruments are inserted to access the baby and repair the defect. Following fetoscopic surgery, the baby can be delivered vaginally. The Colorado Fetal Care Center is one of the top fetal care facilities in the nation. Here, you will have individualized care with experts who have spent years researching, innovating and performing repairs of spina bifida.

We'll show you guys what it looks like and my back as well squatted Properly in months just because the back pain and all that is just out of the flow, but it'll be fun So for 28 years I've been sucking the flat feet I've even made fun of that I run like a duck and It's the truth today the guys at the physiotherapy clinic in the waterfront are gonna help me out with my flat feet We have max and Ken we're gonna assist me with this. So what exactly we're gonna be doing Okay, first part of the treatment will be my special release of the thick fibrous tissue called the plantar fascia Which runs from the hill to the toes? So how are we gonna fix that through the myofascial release to release that tension in that tissue and the second part? We're gonna look at exercises of the foot core muscles, which will be guided by max. I Am so scared. You should Gently give it a thumbs up my pain. I know it's about to be bad I So this arch is completely sort of collapse Yeah as well as what can explain yeah, so I mean you can just feel how tight it is already I mean, I'm literally doing this for I am fear So we're just gonna warm it up for this day and then we're gonna we're gonna get into okay you look a bit scared I'm so worried. I have had anxiety the entire day This is a thing I've had my entire life and I've just avoided it So, what are you doing here, so I'm just trying to I always try I don't never go straight and deep always warm it up First so just trying to warm it up trying to get him a little bit more comfortable and then we'll go into the deep stuff So right now just working the plantar fascia I mean, is it is it gonna be an instant result or it probably would probably take time It wouldn't be an instant result. It would be something that you need to carry on with you back. Yeah in Russia nice Actually is when I do the walking so there was a point where I was doing 20,000 steps To 25,000 steps a day from prep. Okay, so like my feet would like to scrap up at the end of the day I'm just doing this because people pull away Okay You know, we need it needs to be a safe word Protein That's a better say right, yeah I'm just gonna hold you down. Yeah Oh Yeah, we went zero to a hundred really quickly You see it creates mobile point so digs in a little bit Yeah, that's bad Oh That is like a knife cutting through thick butter or not even but I don't know like take me Oh Oh Cool like metal. Yeah, that's what the problem is Oh It's right that you aren't Oh Honey Barbara, yeah, you know, ah I'm seated and my heart rate is it is at 89 seated? 90 seated Explain what you're doing though. It's still working there. Just working the fashion. Yeah So now I'm just adding on a stretch a lot yeah work it while I stretched Not too bad Mmm Wow Oh, yeah, you weren't lying about just tensing all the time So whole body workout Look I don't know why girl doesn't like to see that boys the present pain Oh Whoo, wow, wow Wow It's probably gonna feel like pillows when I walk today That's insane is that normal for people to react that way was it just me no feet feet are not nice. Okay, okay Okay, so like yeah. Wow. I thought I'm just like being a little girl but that It's that arch a yeah, it's the arch Wow Do now So you're gonna try create a fake arch. Yeah, so with your foot and sort of okay, it's flat here So what you're gonna do is you pull your toes back and sort of create a nice fake arch. Okay? Okay So, let's see you do it then Yeah, and you want to hold it hold it for a good ten seconds nine eight seven six five four three Two one and what you want to be careful of is not getting your toes doing this Yeah, so we still want your toes down. Yeah, like your foot down the great notch. Yeah, I do feel an arch a little bit hard Okay, so I'm gonna loop this around okay and around okay put some tension on the band This band might be a little bit hard. Okay. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna close your toes Good close And so try and keep your ankle still yeah So open I close And open good again Good So this bands quite hard, yeah I feel it Yeah, and then the other one you can do is you just do it the other way around but someone can help you this one Okay, so they'll be holding it like this and you're gonna bring it the toe out. So you just the tip. Yeah, it's really hard Yeah, I'm going to control. Yeah, you want to be trying to do this do that But this bands really hard so what you need is a very light TheraBand Yeah, okay, this bands a little bit too hard for that stuff. Okay, and then as I was saying The other thing to get is a nice to cross for this is great for everything Yeah, this is my number one mobility tool. I use this all over my body I got this one and then I got a bigger ball. I don't use a classic foam roller Okay, because these ones I feel get in a lot more so especially shoulder mobility using it to release everything in the back But otherwise you can do this just pop it on the ground and you literally Stand on it. It's really not nice And you're rolling forward Back find a nice spot do little circles on it. It's really not nice. I mean you'll feel for yourself It feels like I've pillows on my feet max and Ken.

Explanation:
The video seems to be focused on the treatment of flat feet and related back pain experienced by the person speaking. While the general aim of addressing these issues is evident, the specific goals or intended outcomes of the treatment are not clearly stated upfront. The aims become clearer as the video progresses and the different treatment steps (myofascial release, foot core exercises, use of tools like therapy band and massage balls) are explained. However, there is no concise statement laying out the objectives at the beginning. The aims are partially clear but could have been more explicitly outlined."," 3

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information about treating flat feet and foot pain. While it goes into some detail on the techniques used by the physiotherapists (myofascial release, foot exercises with resistance bands, using mobility tools like lacrosse balls), it lacks comprehensive explanations or educational components.

The transcript focuses more on the host's reactions and experiences during the treatment session rather than in-depth coverage of the treatment methods themselves. There are mentions of the plantar fascia, foot core muscles, creating arches, etc. but the descriptions remain fairly surface-level.

However, it does give the viewer a first-hand look at what to expect during such a physiotherapy session for flat feet issues. The host's commentary provides some insights, even if they are more anecdotal rather than strictly educational.

Overall, some useful information about flat feet treatments is conveyed, but it falls short of being a thorough, dedicated educational resource"," 2

The video transcript provides some relevant information about dealing with flat feet and related exercises/treatments, but it does not directly address many of the common questions readers might have about flat feet in a comprehensive way. The transcript contains a lot of personal commentary and reactions during the treatment process, which may be entertaining but does not provide substantial educational content.

Some potentially relevant aspects covered include:

- Describing the plantar fascia and its role in flat feet
- Demonstrating stretches/exercises for the arches and feet
- Recommending tools like therapy bands and massage balls

However, it lacks details on causes of flat feet, preventative measures, long-term treatment plans, when to see a doctor, etc. that readers may be interested in learning about flat feet as a medical condition. The focus is more on the personal experience getting treatment rather than comprehensively educating about flat feet."," 2

The video transcript does not explicitly reference or cite any specific sources of information or evidence beyond the expertise and experience of the physiotherapists (Max and Ken) conducting the treatment. While their credentials are briefly mentioned as having ""an amazing background"" and ""the knowledge"", no external sources like research studies or expert opinions are quoted to support the information or techniques being presented.

The narration and explanations provided seem to be based solely on the first-hand knowledge and recommendations of Max and Ken during the treatment session itself. There are no clear citations or references to back up the main claims or statements made about techniques like myofascial release, foot exercises, or using tools like therapy balls.

So while the video draws from the practical expertise of the physiotherapists, it does not transparently cite or reference any other external sources that may have informed their approach. The sources of evidence remain somewhat unclear beyond their stated professional backgrounds."," 1

Explanation: There are no dates provided in the transcript for the sources of information used to compile the video. The transcript appears to be a recording of the person getting treatment for flat feet and does not cite any external sources or mention dates related to when the information was produced."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript seems to be mostly a personal account of the individual's experience with getting treatment for flat feet and does not provide a balanced or objective perspective on the topic. While the therapists provide some explanations about the techniques used, the information is heavily focused on the personal reactions and sensations experienced by the individual undergoing treatment. There is no clear reference to multiple research studies or a range of expert opinions being considered. The tone is conversational and emotive rather than presenting information in an impartial, factual manner. Overall, the transcript lacks the hallmarks of a balanced, unbiased informational video on the topic of flat feet treatment options."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond mentioning the physiotherapy clinic where the session took place. There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information about the topic of flat feet or physical therapy."," 5

Explanation: The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for flat feet. The physiotherapist mentions that it ""wouldn't be an instant result"" and that the exercises and treatments ""would be something that you need to carry on with."" This indicates that there is uncertainty about how quickly the treatments will work and that ongoing treatment may be required. The physiotherapist also discusses trying different exercises with resistance bands, indicating that there are multiple potential treatment options being explored. Overall, the transcript includes clear references to the uncertainty and lack of a single definitive treatment path for addressing the flat feet condition."," 3

The transcript provides some partial descriptions of how the treatments work, but the details are incomplete or unclear in certain parts.

Explanations:

1. The massage/myofascial release technique is described as releasing the ""thick fibrous tissue called the plantar fascia which runs from the heel to the toes"" by applying pressure/stretching to that area. This gives a basic idea of how the treatment aims to improve flexibility in that connective tissue.

2. The foot exercise using the resistance band is described in terms of the specific muscle movements (closing/opening toes, pulling toes back to create an arch), but it doesn't explicitly explain how strengthening those muscles helps treat flat feet.

3. The use of the lacrosse ball for rolling/massage is mentioned, but there are no details provided about the mechanism by which this treatment provides benefits.

So while there are partial descriptions for a couple of the treatments, the transcript lacks"," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments discussed. It mentions that the treatments are aimed at addressing flat feet and back pain, which can be considered as controlling or getting rid of those specific symptoms. However, it does not explicitly describe long-term benefits, such as preventing recurrence or eliminating the conditions permanently. The focus seems to be more on the immediate relief and management of symptoms through techniques like myofascial release and exercises. While some benefits are mentioned, a comprehensive explanation of the benefits for each treatment is lacking."," 2

The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects of the treatments mentioned.

Explanation:
The transcript indicates that some discomfort and pain was experienced during the myofascial release/massage therapy on the plantar fascia area of the feet. However, this seems to be an expected short-term effect of the treatment rather than an outlined risk or side effect. No specific risks, complications or adverse reactions were explicitly described for the stretching/exercise portion of the treatment plan. The only potential risk briefly alluded to was using resistance bands that were too difficult/heavy, which could presumably lead to strain or injury if overexerted. Overall, while some temporary discomfort was portrayed, the video did not comprehensively outline the risks associated with the various treatment modalities discussed."," 1

The video transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for flat feet or related conditions. The focus is entirely on demonstrating and describing the treatment procedures being performed by the physiotherapists. There is no mention of what would happen if no treatment was pursued, or any discussion of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any reference to the overall quality of life or how the described treatment choices (massage, stretches, exercises) might affect day-to-day activities. The focus seems to be solely on describing the treatment process itself and the immediate physical sensations/pain experienced during the treatments. There is no mention of potential long-term impacts on quality of life from the treatments."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet, but the information is incomplete.

While the video focuses mainly on the specific treatment provided (myofascial release and foot exercises), it does briefly mention some alternative treatment options:

1. The therapist suggests that the exercises and self-massage techniques shown need to be continued over time, implying an ongoing treatment plan.

2. The therapist recommends using a mobility tool (lacrosse ball) for self-massage and mobility exercises at home.

However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the various treatment options available for flat feet (e.g., orthotics, braces, physical therapy, surgery, etc.). It also does not clearly describe who would benefit most from each option or under what circumstances one treatment may be preferred over another.

The video focuses primarily on the personal experience of the host undergoing one type of treatment"," 3

The video partially provides support for shared decision-making. While the video does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or health professionals, it does demonstrate the process of seeking professional help from physical therapists for addressing flat feet and back pain issues. The physical therapists explain the treatment approach, which includes myofascial release and exercises, and involve the individual in the process by guiding him through some exercises. However, there is no direct mention of discussing alternative treatment options or making a shared decision about the chosen treatment plan.",set()
-Ot-dP1xST4,"Up-right sprinting, one of the biggest common mistakes during upright sprinting is for the athletes to be tosey. This is what Jene calls it and I really agree. Landing on the toes or landing only on the ball of the foot. We want to land flat-footed, meaning getting that door side flex movement with the foot before you hit the ground. Heel barely misses the ground, she's landing flat. So our way of fixing it, as we talked about, our philosophy is to use forced mechanics drills versus only talking about things. She's going to give me A-skips, a two-stroke movement up to the Z down, but now you're going to land on your heel. So can you just get your foot up, hit your heel a little bit, just get some kinesthetic awareness to remind yourself of the part of the foot that will be hitting the ground. This is very safe and very appropriate. So come up to the Z, land on the heel, very controlled, just feel landing on the heel. Go ahead. Just a regular A-skip. On the heel, on the heel, the part that you hit. Now we're really teaching the door side flex movement and getting her to land on the heel to really get her toes up. A little exaggeration to make sure that she's getting the constant. You're going to turn around. Now I want you to hit your heels one more time just to remind yourself, this is the contact of the point to the ground. You're going to give me B-skips, landing on the heel. Before you go, can you get your toe up, just get your foot up, dangle your toe down. Now her foot coming to the ground, now her leg is so long, we want to make sure that the leg is short so it can swing quicker to the ground because the faster it comes down to the ground, the more force you get out of the ground, the more productive you'll be during the air mechanics, the flight phase of the sprinting. In baseball, if you have a hitter that's swinging the bat and they're slow, what they do in baseball, they bring them a shorter bat to be able to swing quicker. In sprinting, a longer foot, a longer leg will swing slow, produces less force, thus sprint slower. Now we want to make sure that that foot, that leg is shorter by getting door side flexion and make sure that we're landing flat-footed to take advantage of her powerful calf muscles. So give us B-skips, landing on the heel. Calfs close to the hamster on the way up, then land on the heel. Take a break, walk back here. Great job. If you want to just come back here. Now recovery mechanics in upright sprinting, just get the calf close to the hamster, get up to the Z. Yep. One more time. From the ground, pull it forward to calf to hamstring. Bam. This is what we're looking for in recovery mechanics. It makes her leg shorter, thus can swing up faster. Thus, she'll be faster. If that angle is too open, looking not like a Z, like an L, that's a capital L for me. That's a uppercase L. That's a longer lever will make the thigh swing slower coming up. This is not what we're looking for. We want to come up quick, calf to hamster to the Z, then push directly down. Do it again. Come up, push directly down. This is what we're looking for. We're going to add one little thing. We're going to do A skips on the heel, stretching your arms up. If the athletes are slacky, if they're broken at the hips, they're basically losing a lot of force. It's as if you're trying to shoot a cannon out of a canoe. Your force is going all over the place. We want to have a stable posture because this is our platform to apply force. Stick your arms up there, making sure that she's tall at the hips, knees, and ankles. Come up to the Z and land, just A skip movement, land on the heel. Go ahead. Stay tall and land on the heel. Stay in tall and land in a dorsiflexion, getting the heel close to the butt and the way up to make sure that we have a shorter lever at recovery, which will make it faster. Now we're going to do B skips, stretching the arm up, making sure that we're stiff and tall so not wasting force. Land on the heel as well. Stretch your arm up. Calf close to the hamster on the way up, shorter recovery, and land on the heel. Great dorsiflexion, great tall body, stable body posture. Now we're really efficient in applying our force.",Flat Feet,3,4,4,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,3,1," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The transcript provides some indication of the aims of the video, which seems to be about teaching proper sprinting mechanics, particularly related to foot strike and leg/foot positioning during the recovery phase. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront and have to be inferred from the content. The video appears to be giving coaching instructions and explanations for specific drills, but the overall purpose or context is not clearly laid out. The aims are partially clear but could be more explicitly introduced."," 4

The video transcript provides a detailed explanation and demonstration of proper sprinting technique, specifically focusing on the importance of landing flat-footed, achieving proper dorsiflexion (foot flexion), and maintaining a stable body posture. The instructor outlines the rationale behind these techniques, such as promoting a shorter lever action for faster leg swing and efficient force application.

While the transcript covers the technical aspects of upright sprinting thoroughly, it does not explicitly state the overarching aims or objectives of the video. However, based on the content, it can be reasonably inferred that the video aims to teach correct sprinting mechanics, particularly emphasizing the foot strike, leg recovery, and body posture.

Overall, the transcript provides a significant portion of the information one would expect from a video aiming to teach proper sprinting technique, although the specific aims or objectives are not explicitly stated. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially) is appropriate"," 4 (Partially relevant)

Explanation: The transcript provides detailed information about proper sprinting techniques, including foot strike patterns, leg positioning, and body posture. While this information is relevant for athletes and coaches interested in improving sprinting mechanics, it may not directly address common questions that general readers might have about the broader topic of sprinting or running.

The video seems to focus on advanced technical details and drills for optimizing upright sprinting performance, which could be useful for competitive runners or those with a strong background in track and field. However, for readers seeking more general information about the benefits of sprinting, how to get started, basic form tips, or other introductory topics, the video may only partially address their needs.

Overall, the transcript appears to be highly relevant for its intended audience of experienced runners and coaches looking to refine sprinting mechanics, but may not comprehensively cover the range of questions that a broader readership might have about"," 3

sf_Q9NSiPvk,"The procedure is started by making an L-shaped skin incision on the lateral side of the heel to expose the calcaneus, the heel bone. This incision is used to protect nerves and tissues, which will allow for optimal scar healing. A saw template is used to make an accurate cut through the calcaneus bone. The template is secured to the bone by lightly tapping the pins in the template with a mallet. A saw is then used to make a precise cut through the bone. Once the cut has been made, the saw template is removed. The template will leave two perfectly sized holes for placement of guide pins. The calcaneal step plate is secured with two locking drill guide towers and then placed over these guide pins. One of the pins is removed and a drill is placed through the tower for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the first screw. The drill guide is removed and the first screw is securely locked into place. This step is repeated for the second screw placement. Following placement of the second screw, the drill guides are then attached to the next available slots in the plate and used to push the cut portion of the heel towards the internal side of the heel. An S-shaped guide can also be used to assist the surgeon in pushing the heel into an accurate position. While maintaining this position, the surgeon will then place a drill guide through a slot in the plate, which will allow the surgeon to compress the plate with a screw into a secure and accurate position. Once the compression screw has been placed, the surgeon will then proceed to use the drill guide towers for accurate drilling, direction and depth for placement of the remaining screws, to secure the plate into its final locked position against the heel bone. The surgeon will then repair the L-shaped incision with great care. This Calcania step plate was designed with a low profile so the patient should not feel any screws or hardware that have been secured into the bone. It can also be used in pediatric populations.",Flat Feet,4,4,4,2,1,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1," 4

1LogN1M_dyY,"- Hey, have you struggled to fix your flat feet all your life? Well, today I'm gonna show you how I went from this, to this. (bright music) - Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health, where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do it yourself programs. The exercise in question is the arch raise. I'm gonna show you how to do it, and then I'm gonna explain to you why it's proper execution is crucial to fixing your flat feet. To perform this exercise, you've got three key points. Number one is, as you lift yourself off the floor, like so, you're trying to move your Achilles tendon out this way, so it's like you're trying to roll your ankle out this way as you lift your foot. Key point number two is, as you roll your ankle out, you're trying to keep the big toe mound on the floor, as much as possible, so you've got your ankle rolling out one way, and you've got your forefoot rolling in the other way. That's two key points so far. The third key point is, as you come up on your heels, try not to grip the floor with your toes. Your toes will be somewhat active, but they shouldn't be trying to scrunch the ground like this as you lift your heel, because that will get in the way of getting that pure big toe mound bend that is essential to this exercise. To understand how this exercise helps, let's review the conditions of success of a strong and staple foot. Among those conditions are, a vertical Achilles tendon when seen from behind the ankle, and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then your Achilles tendon when seen from behind is probably going to be angled inward, and in this exercise, we're training your ability to roll your ankle out, moving that Achilles tendon from that inward pointing position to an outward pointing position. Outwards, so that you now have the range to get it right back in the center when you need it to be there. But if that's all you have, if you're only able to roll your ankle out to get your Achilles tendon to be vertical, without changing the rest of your foot, then you've got this big toe mound that's off the floor, and that's not a very stable foot either. That's where the second key point of this exercise comes in, which is intend to press the big toe mound onto the floor, even as you are rolling your ankle outwards. What this does is it reinforces your ability to create that foot tripod position while you maintain a vertical Achilles tendon. Lastly, the third key point, you need to be able to keep your toes relatively relaxed compared to what the rest of your foot is doing, because if your toes are stuck in this death grip mode, then, when you raise your heel off the floor, you're not gonna be able to keep your big toe mound pushing into the floor. Your toes need to relax in order for you to get that big toe mound pressing into the floor, creating that foot tripod that we want. Now that you understand the three key points of this exercise, and the why behind them, if you're having trouble performing this exercise exactly the way that I'm showing it to you, then feel free to modify this exercise. For example, if you're having trouble staying balanced, and that's really throwing off your ability to get at three key points, then maybe stand at a wall, maybe hold onto a stick as you're performing it, maybe take a wider stance, do what you need to do to get the three key points. Now, you may be wondering, ""How many sets, how many reps of this exercise should I do?"" The answer to that is it depends. What does it depend on? Depends on what does it take for you to be able to get a training effect from this exercise. That means if this is your first day, and you really need to slow down your reps to feel the right stuff happening, and you're only able to get five total reps because of that, that's totally fine, do five super, super, super slow reps. Do what you need to do to feel like something has changed after you've done the exercise. Perhaps in a month, after you're more used to this exercise and you're just using it for your warmups, for maybe after your lifting sessions, and you're able to pump out, let's say 30 reps, and they're all pretty quick, and you like it that way, and you feel like that gives you a training effect as opposed to the five super slow reps that you started with, then do that. The principle here is do what you need to do to get a training effect from this exercise. That does it for this exercise.

The video transcript partially makes the aims clear. While the overall goal of helping fix flat feet is stated upfront, the specific aims of demonstrating and explaining the ""arch raise"" exercise are not explicitly laid out at the beginning. However, the transcript does go into detailed explanations and instructions for performing the arch raise exercise correctly, and ties it back to how it can help fix flat feet by reinforcing proper foot mechanics. So while the overarching aim is evident, the narrower focus on this specific exercise technique is not overtly stated as an aim initially. The aims become clearer as the video progresses."," 4

The video partially achieves its aims of showing how to fix flat feet through the arch raise exercise. It provides detailed instructions on how to properly perform the exercise, including the three key points (rolling the ankle out, keeping the big toe mound on the floor, and relaxing the toes). It also explains the rationale behind each of these points and how they relate to correcting the conditions associated with flat feet, such as a vertical Achilles tendon and maintaining the foot tripod.

However, the video does not provide comprehensive information on the overall treatment plan or other exercises/stretches that may be necessary to fully address flat feet. While it mentions that there is a complementary stretch that pairs well with the arch raise exercise, it does not go into detail about that stretch or other potential components of a flat feet treatment program.

Overall, the video succeeds in thoroughly explaining and demonstrating the arch raise exercise itself, but falls slightly short in providing a"," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about an exercise called the ""arch raise"" that is specifically aimed at addressing flat feet. It covers the key points and proper execution of the exercise, as well as the reasoning behind why it can be beneficial for improving flat feet conditions. The transcript explains how the exercise targets strengthening the arches, aligning the Achilles tendon, and promoting a stable foot tripod position.

However, the information is focused solely on this one exercise, and while it is relevant for addressing flat feet, it may not comprehensively cover all the questions readers might have about flat feet, such as other exercises, stretches, or treatments. Additionally, the video does not delve into the causes, symptoms, or potential complications of flat feet.

Overall, the transcript is quite relevant for someone specifically interested in learning about the ""arch raise"" exercise for flat feet, but it may only partially address the broader topic of flat feet and"," 2

The video does not explicitly cite or reference any external sources of information beyond the personal experience and advice of the presenter.

Explanation:
The video provides a decent explanation of how the arch raise exercise is performed and its intended effects on the foot and ankle positioning. However, it does not go into significant detail about the specific mechanisms by which this exercise helps to ""fix flat feet"" or strengthen the arches from a physiological or biomechanical perspective. The descriptions focus more on the desired positioning and movement patterns rather than the underlying processes within the body that lead to improved arch strength and foot mechanics. Some key points about how the exercise works are mentioned, such as improving Achilles tendon alignment and promoting a tripod foot position, but the explanations remain somewhat superficial without delving into the anatomical details of how these changes are achieved through the exercise. Overall, while the video is informative about the exercise itself, it only partially covers the ""how it works"" aspect in terms of the biological effects on the body."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the arch raise exercise for treating flat feet. It explains that the exercise aims to improve the positioning of the Achilles tendon and create a ""foot tripod"" position, which are important for addressing flat feet. However, it does not explicitly state the specific benefits or outcomes in terms of controlling/eliminating symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition itself, both short-term and long-term. The focus is more on the mechanics of how to perform the exercise correctly rather than detailing its potential benefits."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments or exercises discussed. While it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects, it does provide some guidance on modifying the exercises based on individual ability and avoiding potential issues. For example, it suggests using support (wall, stick, wider stance) if having trouble maintaining balance during the exercises. It also advises starting slowly with fewer reps if new to the exercise. However, it does not go into detail about specific risks, complications or adverse reactions that could potentially arise from performing the exercises incorrectly or excessively. Overall, it touches on modifying the exercises to avoid potential issues, but does not comprehensively cover the risks associated with the treatments."," 1

The video focuses solely on describing an exercise (the arch raise) that can help fix flat feet. There is no mention of what would happen if this exercise or any other treatment is not used, nor any discussion of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment for flat feet."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not contain any reference to how the described treatment (the arch raise exercise) affects overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The video focuses solely on explaining the proper technique for performing the exercise and its intended purpose of correcting flat feet. There is no mention of how this exercise or the correction of flat feet might impact a person's quality of life or ability to perform daily activities."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet, but the information is somewhat unclear or incomplete.

While the video focuses primarily on demonstrating and explaining the arch raise exercise as a treatment for flat feet, it does suggest some alternatives or modifications to consider:

1. It mentions that if you have trouble performing the exercise as demonstrated, you can modify it by standing at a wall, holding onto a stick, or taking a wider stance.

2. It also suggests that the number of sets and reps can vary depending on your ability and what it takes for you to get a training effect.

However, the video does not explicitly describe who is most likely to benefit from the arch raise exercise or any alternative treatments. It also does not provide a comprehensive discussion of other potential treatment options beyond the arch raise exercise and its modifications.

k2HKIN1iuFA,being on your toes or being flat-footed which one is better which one should you be doing on this video i'm going to give you the pros and cons of both of them so you know which one you should be doing and when you should be doing it because there's a lot of benefits to both of them and there's a lot of negatives to both of them as well my name is tony jeffries olympic bronze medalist former undefeated professional seven times national champion european champion welcome to my youtube channel big thank you to sam kirkdale for requesting this video in the comments below guys if you've got any video requests you want me to make please let me know in the comments below i'll be reading them all so should you be on your toes should you be flat-footed it's funny because when i turned professional after having a very successful amateur career where i was on my toes a lot everyone told us tony you need to slow down you need to plant your feet and throw them punches but a lot of them people were wrong and i'm going to tell you exactly why first thing i'm going to break down is flat-footed the pros and cons of being flat-footed so the biggest pro of being flat-footed is you can generate more power in your punches so when i'm here i'm flat-footed and as you can see i'm generating a lot of power right there as long as you're turning your hips and fully extending exhaling doing all the right things you can generate so much power when you've got your feet planted here then also your balance is better when you're flat-footed compared to being up on your toes you're flat-footed you can throw my balance is really good there throwing these longer combinations guys i've done a full video on how to keep your balance when throwing long combinations you can check that one out after here and yes balance is very important once you've got your feet planted you get really good balance and kind of following on with your balance is you can work better inside when your feet is planted so i'm inside so now because these feet are planted that can work great inside and another massive benefit of being flat-footed is you're saving more energy if you're walking around the ring like this you know you're not using much energy at all so you can save a lot more energy so let me tell you about the cons of being flat-footed the first one is your punches from the outside are generally slower because you're flat-footed yeah your punches are going to be slower and then for me the worst thing about being flat-footed is you're relying on head moving and reactions for defense you'll be inside and the only way you can really defend is by you moving your head blocking here taking the punches here if you're not moving your feet to defend it's very risky because that means you're always in range to get hit now on your toes the pros and cons of being on your toes the number one is you've got better defense if you're on your toes you can defend better and footwork is by far the best defense that you can do because if you think about it if i'm here and someone throws a punch and i step back i've got out the way the punch but if they if the punch is coming and it is landing and i'm stepping at the same time it's going to take the sting out of the punch so footwork defense is the best sort of defense you can do so when i'm on my toes i'm gonna be in and out defending always ready for that punch coming back and getting out the way of it also a big massive pro for this is you can punch faster yes you can punch faster when you're on your toes i've done a video on how they instantly punch faster check that out and one of the things that i talk about is moving in and out with your feet when i'm moving in and out with my feet i punch faster and Manny Pacquiao was an absolute master at doing this he would step and punch at the same time and that's how he generated so much hand speed another thing it looks better you look like a better fighter when you're here on your toes compared to here plodding forward you know this doesn't really look very good but if you're on your toes that looks way better but for me the big one is the defense moving in and out keeping your opponent thinking and this is why i prefer to be on my toes compared to being flat footed and there is a time and a place for both but now let's get on to the cons of being on your toes the biggest one is it uses more energy but what one of my old amateur boxing trainers David Binns who was an amazing coach he still is amazing coach used to tell us was if you can box on your toes and box like that for four two minute rounds you can do it for 12 three minute rounds all it comes down to is conditioning now if you look at someone like Muhammad Ali in his early days he was a master at moving around on his toes so that kind of dismisses that con about using more energy even though it does you've just got to condition yourself to be able to do it for longer now another con is that your punches is not going to be as hard but when you mix it up on your toes with plant in your feet you can still punch hard that's why you should master both of them being on your toes and being flat footed and then the other con i guess is balance you know you you might be losing your balance when you're moving around trying to throw these punches but when you practice this you're only going to get better at it and you're never going to lose your balance so which one should you be practicing guys before i tell you this please if you haven't already subscribed this channel hit that bell notification to get notified every time i upload a boxing education video like this one also give me a like any comments below i'll be reading them all so you should be practicing both a bit of both i would advise practicing more on your toes because it's harder to box on your toes like this than it is flat footed so once you master moving in and out being on your toes working on them fast punches all of the pros that i said about being on your toes then you can work on being flat footed but i believe so much that working on your footwork is very important footwork is the most important thing in boxing without your feet underneath you you're going to be probably useless everywhere else there's not many great fighters who didn't have great footwork

The transcript solely focuses on explaining the pros and cons of each stance and does not suggest further reading materials or mention other organizations that could provide more advice and information on this subject."," 5

Explanation: The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty or differences in expert opinion concerning the choice between being on the toes versus being flat-footed when boxing. The presenter discusses the pros and cons of both stances, acknowledging that there are benefits and drawbacks to each approach. He states that there was differing advice given to him when he turned professional, with some telling him to plant his feet more (be flat-footed) while others advocated staying on the toes. Ultimately, he recommends practicing and mastering both stances, as there is a time and place for each depending on the situation. This suggests there is no definitive consensus on which stance is universally better, and the choice depends on factors like energy conservation, power generation, defense, and individual fighting style. The uncertainty around the optimal approach is clearly conveyed."," 4

The video partially describes how the treatments (being on toes vs flat-footed) work in terms of their effects on the body. It provides a good overview of the pros and cons of each approach, including how they impact power generation, balance, energy expenditure, defense/evasion, and punching speed. However, it does not go into deep mechanistic details about precisely how being on the toes or flat-footed enables those effects from a physiological or biomechanical perspective. The explanations focus more on the practical implications rather than the underlying mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, it covers the key benefits and drawbacks of each technique in a comprehensible way for the intended audience."," 4

2) Better balance
3) Working better on the inside
4) Saving more energy

For being on the toes, the benefits mentioned are:
1) Better defense and footwork
2) Ability to punch faster
3) Looks better aesthetically 

However, the transcript does not explicitly mention any benefits related to controlling/preventing recurrence of any specific condition or eliminating a condition long-term. It focuses more on the technique/performance benefits in a boxing context.

So while it covers some benefits for each stance, it does not comprehensively describe all potential benefits, especially related to treating/managing medical conditions. Hence, a score of 4"," 2

The transcript partially describes risks or potential downsides of being flat-footed versus being on the toes during boxing, but does not provide comprehensive information about risks, side-effects or complications for either approach.

For being flat-footed, the only potential downside mentioned is relying more on head movement and reactions for defense, which could increase the risk of getting hit.

For being on the toes, the main drawbacks noted are increased energy expenditure and potentially reduced punching power compared to a flat-footed stance.

However, the transcript does not delve into specific risks, side-effects or complications like potential injuries, long-term effects on joints/muscles, etc. that could arise from favoring one stance over the other for an extended period. It focuses more on the pros and cons from a technique/strategy perspective in boxing. But it does not provide a comprehensive overview of health/safety risks for each approach."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment or postponing treatment for a medical condition.

GPS10HfgYDY,"Flat feet are typically caused by a bone inside the foot that is hypermobile and comes out of alignment. It's called the talus bone. And if you can use the analogy of a stone bridge, that if you have stones that come up to the center of the bridge, and you pluck out that middle stone, then the bridge collapses. Well, essentially, in the foot, the talus bone, which is inside the ankle joint, acts like that stone bridge and that center stone. And typically what happens with a flat foot is that the talus bone migrates forward on ambulation. So when a person steps down and puts their full weight, the talus moves forward like this, which then causes the midfoot to unlock. And then you have a flat foot. Now, we do have treatments for this condition. And typically you do want to treat a flat foot because if you don't, there can be issues with ankle pain, with knee pain, hip pain, and back pain. Because if you can imagine your base is out of alignment, then the rest of your joints can become out of alignment. Which our thought is that this can cause arthritis at a premature age and various kinds of joint pains up the extremity, up the kinetic chain.

The aims seem to be to explain the causes of flat feet, the potential issues if left untreated, and the treatments available. While the first two points are covered well, the third point about treatments is only briefly mentioned without providing any details.

Overall, the transcript achieves most of its aims but falls short in fully explaining the treatment options for flat feet."," 5 (Yes: the information is relevant)

Explanation: The transcript provides relevant and detailed information about flat feet, including the underlying cause (hypermobility of the talus bone), a clear analogy to explain the mechanism (the stone bridge analogy), and the potential consequences of leaving flat feet untreated (joint pain, premature arthritis). The transcript also mentions that there are treatments available for flat feet, although it does not provide specifics. Overall, the information addresses key questions that readers might have about flat feet, such as the cause, mechanism, and potential complications, making it highly relevant."," 2 (Partially)

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about the sources used, but it is not entirely clear or comprehensive. The speaker identifies himself as Dr. Thomas Goldman, a podiatrist working with Mount Sinai Doctors, which suggests that his expertise and experience in the field are the primary sources of information. However, there are no explicit references to specific research studies, expert opinions, or other external sources to support the claims made about the causes and treatments of flat feet.

While the speaker provides a detailed explanation of the anatomical causes of flat feet using an analogy, there is no mention of where this information or analogy originates from. Similarly, the discussion about the potential consequences of untreated flat feet and the need for treatment is presented as the speaker's professional opinion, but without citing any specific sources or evidence.

Explanation: The transcript does not provide dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date-related information provided is the name of the speaker, Dr. Thomas Goldman, and the institution he works for, Mount Sinai Doctors. However, there are no specific dates mentioned regarding when the information presented in the video was produced or when the sources referenced were published. Therefore, the score is 2, indicating that only the date of the video itself (or the speaker's current affiliation) is clear, but no dates for the acknowledged sources have been given."," 2

Explanation:

The provided transcript appears to be partially unbalanced or biased in its presentation of information regarding flat feet. While the video provides an explanation of the potential cause of flat feet and the potential consequences of not treating it, it lacks a balanced discussion of other possible causes, treatment options, or alternative perspectives.

The video focuses solely on one specific cause (the hypermobile talus bone) and emphasizes the importance of treating flat feet to avoid potential future issues like joint pain and arthritis. However, it does not mention or consider other potential causes of flat feet, such as genetic factors, muscle weakness, or other structural abnormalities.

Additionally, the video does not present any information on the range of available treatment options for flat feet, such as exercises, orthotics, or surgical interventions. It only implies that treatment is necessary without providing details on the various treatment approaches.

Furthermore, the video lacks references to multiple research studies or expert"," 1

There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information about flat feet or related conditions."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for flat feet. It provides a clear explanation of the cause of flat feet and the potential consequences of not treating the condition, but it does not discuss different treatment options or any uncertainty surrounding those choices. The transcript is focused on informing the viewer about the condition itself and the importance of seeking treatment, without delving into the specifics of treatment modalities or any differences in expert opinion on those choices."," 3

Explanation:
The transcript provides a detailed description of how flat feet are caused by the misalignment of the talus bone, which is likened to the collapse of a stone bridge. This explanation gives insight into the mechanism behind flat feet.

However, the transcript does not provide details on how the treatments mentioned actually work to address or correct the issue of flat feet. The treatments are only mentioned briefly without any explanation of their mode of action or how they act on the body to achieve their effect.

Therefore, while the cause of flat feet is well-explained, the treatments themselves are not described in terms of how they work, resulting in a partial score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of treating flat feet. It mentions that if left untreated, flat feet can lead to issues such as ankle, knee, hip, and back pain, as well as premature arthritis. However, it does not explicitly describe the specific benefits of the treatments themselves. The transcript mentions that ""we do have treatments for this condition,"" but does not elaborate on what those treatments are or how they can help control, prevent, or eliminate the condition and its symptoms."," 1

K7y1tU8UhTA,"♪ - [Intro Singer] Bob and Brad ♪ ♪ the two most famous physical therapists on the internet. ♪ - Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist - Brad Heineck, physical therapist - And together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. Almost didn't get that out, Brad. - In our opinion of course, Bob. - Wow, we got a good start here, don't we? Okay, Brad, today, we're gonna talk about how flat feet can damage feet, knees and hips. All the way up the chain, basically. - You better believe it right from there to the top. Don't get too excited. If you are flat footed, this may not happen to you. Depends how severe it is, but this is a mechanics of it. And it's very interesting. So why don't you, Bob stand? - You want me to start up with that? - Alright. Let's let's get right up there. Bob's our volunteer and model for this. There you go. Be careful Bob. - Yep. - Be careful. - There you go. - Be Careful. There you go. - I actually do not have flat feet - Right, but we're, we'll get this. Let's show you how to do it. Can we zoom into the arch of the foot here? Right there? Bob's got a nice arch Yeah. Now I want you to flatten out a little bit and when you put weight on it, this gap right here where my fingers are, this bone right here will actually come down and some people make contact with the floor. That's pretty severe. - [Bob] Yeah. - Okay. And if that's happening with you you probably have some special shoes if you're going that flat. Okay. So that's what we're calling flat foot or pronation in the therapy world. - [Bob] Right. - Okay. So what happens is the tissues underneath here, the plantar, the bottom tissues when your foot splays out, they get stretched. And over time they can continue to stretch, stretch stretch. And like I said, get that navicular bone right down to the tape right down to the floor which is not what you want. So some supportive shoes which I'll talk about in a little bit, the next thing if we go up to the knee, what happens to the mechanics of the leg when that foot pronates and flattens out the tibia rotates this direction this way. So look at the red tape right there. It goes in and we got a little rotation there and that can throw the mechanics of the knee off slightly. Therefore you can, you know, get some arthritis arthritic changes prematurely in the knee, Bob. - [Bob] It's amazing how the slightest little change there can affect this and that can affect pain - Yep, and create problems along the way But wait, Bob, there's more. - [Bob] Yes, there is more - Okay. That in turn rotates the tibia and look at the knee. it also puts a stress on the MCL, the ligament here. And you get that bowling - Your collateral ligament, - Knock knees. - Yeah. So you can see both knees are starting to get knock kneed because I'm flat foot. And you see that quite often on people, Brad they're walking along and I can see their they're flat feet are causing them to be knock kneed. - Right. It's going right up the chain. And then even up into the hip, the femur will rotate in and that can put some stress on the posterior muscles on the back side of the hip and into the the joint itself. Again can cause problems as we age prematurely as if you, you know, if you didn't have. - It's like a little hole in the dam, isn't it. - Right. So what's a easy way to correct this. We do have a video with some exercises that can help this. - Sure. - But you know, the, the probably the better way is to get the proper pair of footwear for this. And you can do this without getting custom footwear for five or $600, depending on the severity of your case. But let me get a shoe here. And if you go and you're gonna ask for to a good shoe store and say, I need a pair of shoe for flat footed people or technically they called motion control shoes. If you say the term motion control, - I'll put the word down below Brad, - Any good salesperson should know exactly what you're talking about. And this is not a motion control shoe but on a motion control shoe you're gonna notice a very thick, sole right through here you're not gonna have this end in here. It's all the way across. It's very thick and it's, it's that way. So support so that when your foot flattens it supports it. - Right. - And, and if you do this to motion control shoe you will not have this bend. It'll be like, almost like a board and just a tip bend a little bit. - Sure. Very, very stiff. - They're gonna be about 150 bucks or so dependent on what you get, so buy 'em on sale. If you're like me and that's, that's it. - Yeah. That'll help control the problems going all the way up the. - Yeah. But even if you get these motion control shoes it's not gonna do anything for that broken heart, Bob. - That's right. We can fix just about anything but we can't fix broken heart. Darn. - What do you say to that Leopold? - I sure hope we can figure, figure that out sometimes. So thanks.",Flat Feet,2,3,5,2,2,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,1,3,2," 2

The aims of the video are partially clear. The transcript indicates that the video is about explaining how flat feet can lead to problems in the knees, hips, and other parts of the body due to the biomechanical effects. However, the specific aims or goals of the video are not explicitly stated beyond this general topic. The transcript jumps right into the discussion without clearly laying out the intended purpose or learning objectives for the viewer."," 3

The video partially achieves its stated aim of explaining how flat feet can damage feet, knees and hips. Here's a breakdown:

Positives:
- It provides a good visual demonstration of how flat feet cause inward rotation of the leg and knee.
- It explains how this inward rotation can lead to problems like arthritis in the knee, stress on knee ligaments, and issues in the hip joint over time.
- It recommends getting proper ""motion control"" shoes as an easy way to help correct the issues caused by flat feet.

Negatives:
- While it mentions that flat feet can damage the feet themselves, it doesn't go into much detail on specifically how flat feet impact the feet.
- The explanation of how the issues progress from the feet up to the knees and hips is a bit brief and could use more detail.
- It mentions exercises that can help but doesn't provide any examples or elabor"," 5

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant to the topic of flat feet and how they can affect the mechanics of the feet, knees, and hips. The physical therapists provide a clear and detailed explanation of the issues caused by flat feet, including overpronation, stretched plantar tissues, rotational stresses on the knees and hips, and potential premature arthritis. They also offer practical advice on using motion control shoes to help mitigate these problems. The information directly addresses common questions and concerns that readers might have regarding the impact of flat feet on the body and potential solutions. Therefore, the video appears to be very relevant and informative on this subject matter."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some references to general concepts like ""motion control shoes"" and exercises that can help with flat feet, but does not cite specific sources or research studies to back up the claims made about how flat feet can lead to issues up the kinetic chain (knees, hips, etc.). The advice seems to be based primarily on the personal expertise and experience of the physical therapists presenting the information, without explicit references to external evidence sources. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating the sources of evidence are partially clear, as some general concepts are mentioned but no specific citations are provided."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date that is clear is the date when the video itself was likely recorded or published, based on the present tense used throughout. However, there are no dates mentioned for any external sources, studies, or references that may have informed the content about flat feet and their potential impacts. Therefore, while the video date itself is evident, the dates of the main sources of information are not provided, resulting in a score of 2 (Partially clear)."," 3

Explanation:

The video provides some useful information on the potential impacts of flat feet on the knees, hips, and overall body mechanics. However, there are a few biases and limitations:

1. Personal perspective: The video is presented from the personal viewpoint of the two physical therapists, without clearly referencing broader research or consulting other experts. Their opinions seem to drive the narrative.

2. One-sided focus: The video focuses solely on the potential negative impacts of flat feet, without exploring if mild cases may not necessarily lead to problems or discussing other treatment options beyond motion control shoes.

3. Limited evidence: While the mechanics are explained, there is no citation of specific research studies or data to back up the claims about flat feet leading to arthritis, knee issues, etc.

4. Commercial angle: There is a promotional element when recommending the motion control shoes, without exploring the full range of treatment choices.

However, the video"," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to the topic of flat feet and their potential impacts on the body. The video focuses solely on explaining the mechanics of how flat feet can affect knees, hips, and other body parts, as well as recommending the use of motion control shoes to help mitigate these issues. No suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information on this topic are provided."," 1 (No)

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for flat feet. The video provides a clear explanation of how flat feet can affect the mechanics of the body and cause issues up the kinetic chain, from the feet to the knees and hips. It also recommends using motion control shoes as a treatment option for flat feet, without discussing any alternative treatments or uncertainties surrounding this recommendation. The information presented is straightforward and does not acknowledge any differences in expert opinion or uncertainties related to treatment choices for flat feet."," 3

The video partially describes how some of the treatments work, but lacks details for others.

Explanation:
The video provides a decent explanation of how flat feet can cause issues up the kinetic chain, affecting the knees and hips through altered biomechanics. It visually demonstrates the excessive pronation and internal rotation of the tibia and femur that can occur.

However, when it comes to describing how the recommended ""motion control"" shoes work to treat the issue, the explanation is fairly brief and lacks specifics. It states that the thick, stiff soles support the foot to prevent excessive flattening/pronation, but doesn't go into further detail about how that affects the biomechanical chain and corrects the abnormal motions described earlier.

So while it covers the underlying problem mechanism well, the description of how the proposed solution (motion control shoes) actually addresses and corrects that problem is incomplete. More details on the"," 2

The video partially describes the benefits of treatments for flat feet. It explains how flat feet can lead to problems in the knees, hips, and other parts of the body due to altered mechanics. However, it only directly mentions the benefit of using motion control shoes to support the arch and prevent the foot from flattening too much. No specific benefits are described for other potential treatments like exercises or custom orthotics. The focus is more on explaining the potential issues caused by flat feet rather than detailing the benefits of different treatment options."," 2

The video partially describes risks or side effects associated with the treatments mentioned. It explains how flat feet can lead to problems like knee arthritis, ligament stress, and hip issues if left untreated. However, it does not explicitly mention any potential risks or side effects of using motion control shoes, which is the main treatment recommended.

While the video does a good job of explaining how flat feet can cause problems up the kinetic chain if not addressed, it fails to discuss any downsides, complications or potential adverse effects of the recommended motion control shoe treatment itself. Providing balanced information on both the benefits and risks of a treatment option is important for fully informed decision-making."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating flat feet or postponing treatment. The video focuses on explaining how flat feet can lead to biomechanical issues affecting the knees, hips, and other parts of the body over time. It recommends using motion control shoes as a treatment option to provide support and prevent these issues from developing. However, it does not discuss what would happen if no treatment is used or if treatment is delayed or forgone permanently. The video does not mention any risks or benefits of watchful waiting or not treating flat feet."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any reference to the overall quality of life in relation to the treatment choices for flat feet. The discussion focuses on explaining the mechanics of how flat feet can affect the knees, hips, and other parts of the body, and recommends using motion control shoes as a treatment option. However, there is no mention of how this treatment choice or any other options might impact the day-to-day activities or overall quality of life for the patient."," 3

Explanation:
The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet. It clearly recommends using motion control shoes as a treatment option for flat feet to help prevent issues further up the kinetic chain like knee and hip problems. However, the video does not provide much detail on who might benefit most from motion control shoes versus other potential treatment options. It briefly mentions that there is another video with exercises that can help, suggesting exercise as an alternative treatment, but does not go into any detail about the circumstances under which exercise may be preferred over shoes or vice versa. The overall focus is on explaining the mechanics of how flat feet can cause problems and promoting motion control shoes as a solution, without comprehensively comparing and contrasting different treatment choices or describing ideal patient profiles for each option."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but not very explicitly or extensively.

It suggests discussing footwear options like motion control shoes with a salesperson or shoe store employee to help address issues related to flat feet. This could be seen as involving others in the decision-making process regarding treatment choices.

However, the video does not explicitly encourage discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals like doctors or physical therapists. The focus is more on providing education about the potential impacts of flat feet and recommending a specific product solution.

While getting proper footwear could be considered a treatment choice, the video does not present it as one option among many to be discussed and decided upon through a shared decision-making process. The recommendation for motion control shoes is quite definitive without much exploration of alternatives or involvement of others in the decision.

SEocnyAGcFg,"The Arthrex internal brace spring ligament augmentation repair is a surgery for people who have flat foot due to weakness or rupture of the spring ligament or posterior tibial tendon. Spring ligament is the connecting tissue located under the foot that connects the calcaneus and the vicular bone. This ligament is often repaired in people that have a condition called flat foot. It is when the arch of the foot collapses, coming into contact with the ground. The repair begins with the surgeon making a cut on the side of the ankle where the calcaneus, vicular bone, and medial cuneiform are located. Next, the surgeon will create a bone tunnel by drilling into the sesentaculum tali of the calcaneus using a guide wire and drill guide. The bone tunnel is made in the calcaneus to prepare for a Swiveloc suture anchor loaded with fiber tape. The Swiveloc anchor is screwed into place. Next, the FDL tendon, also known as flexor digitorum longus, located on the medial side of the leg is identified, cut, and then tagged with a fiber loop stitching technique. A bone tunnel is made in the navicular to prepare for an additional Swiveloc anchor. The ankle structures are tensioned and fixed into place by taking one part of the fiber tape and passing it from top to bottom with a suture passing wire. Then, take the other part of the fiber tape with the sutures from the FDL tendon and passing it from bottom to top. The surgeon then holds it in place by inserting the Swiveloc from bottom to top. The remaining sutures are cut. The supporting structures of the arch of the foot are now repaired and held together with the internal brace, causing the arch of the foot to be restored.",Flat Feet,4,4,4,2,2,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,1,2,2," 4

The causes for flat feet can be congenital, in that you're born with it, or acquired, which develops with age. Acquired flat feet typically occurs secondary to wear and tear on the tendon on the inside of your foot called the posterior tibial tendon. Through repetitive trauma or acute trauma, this tendon can weaken and the arch can lower. Flat feet may not hurt. Some people just have flat feet, and it may not be a problem all their lives. However, there are quite a few conditions that are associated with flat feet. The development of bunions and hammertoes is common with people with flat feet. The development of heel and arch pain is also common with people with flat feet.

Overall, the information provided in the transcript is comprehensive and directly addresses the topic of taping for plantar fasciitis, making it highly relevant for readers interested in this subject."," 3

The video provides some references to sources of information, but not in a comprehensive manner. Here's my explanation:

1. The video mentions using specific taping techniques and products (e.g., coverall, leukotape) for supporting the foot arch and relieving plantar fasciitis symptoms. However, it does not cite any specific research studies or expert sources that validate the effectiveness of these taping methods.

2. The video briefly mentions the anatomy of the foot arches (medial longitudinal arch, lateral longitudinal arch, and transverse arch) and the posterior tibialis tendon/muscle. While this anatomical information is likely based on established medical knowledge, no specific sources are referenced.

3. The video does not provide any references or citations for the proposed mechanism of how the taping technique supports the foot arch and potentially relieves plantar fasciitis symptoms.

4. The video relies primarily on the presenter's expertise and experience"," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides some dates or timeframes related to the information presented, but not for all sources acknowledged. Specifically:

- The date of the video itself is not explicitly stated, but it is implied to be recent based on the introduction (""welcome back to rehab and revive physical therapy"").

- No dates or timeframes are provided for the anatomical/medical information about the foot arches, plantar fasciitis, taping techniques, etc. This information is likely drawn from established medical knowledge, but no specific sources or dates are cited.

- The only timeframe mentioned is ""temporary"" in reference to the taping being a temporary solution, not a permanent one.

The video transcript seems to be mostly balanced and unbiased, providing information on taping for plantar fasciitis from a medical professional's perspective. However, there are a few aspects that suggest some potential bias or lack of objectivity:

1. The video focuses solely on the taping technique as a treatment option for plantar fasciitis, without mentioning or comparing it to other possible treatment choices, such as stretching exercises, orthotics, or medication.

2. While the taping technique is demonstrated on a patient (Griffin), there is no reference to any specific research studies or broader evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach.

3. The language used in the video is generally instructional and informative, but there are a few instances where it may come across as slightly promotional or anecdotal, such as ""Griffin will let us know definitely still need a little bit of strengthening cannot rely on tape always to support your"," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details or suggestions for additional sources of support or information related to plantar fasciitis or taping techniques. The video solely focuses on demonstrating the taping method for plantar fasciitis support, without mentioning any external resources or organizations that could provide further advice or information on the topic."," 5

Explanation: The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for plantar fasciitis. Specifically, it mentions that the taping technique shown is a temporary solution and not a permanent fix. The expert states, ""it's not a permanent solution, it is temporary but it should give some relief from plantar fasciitis."" Additionally, the expert emphasizes that strengthening exercises are needed and one ""cannot rely on tape always to support your arch, you need to rely on your own muscles."" This discussion acknowledges the limitations of the taping treatment and the need for other interventions, indicating uncertainty about a single treatment being fully effective."," 3

Explanation:

The video partially describes how the taping treatment works to support the foot arch and relieve plantar fasciitis pain. It provides some details on how the taping lifts and supports the navicular bone and the arch of the foot. However, it does not go into depth about the underlying mechanisms of how this taping approach alleviates plantar fasciitis symptoms or how it interacts with the body's structures involved in plantar fasciitis. The description remains somewhat superficial and focused more on the taping technique itself rather than the physiological effects. So while there are some details provided about how the treatment is intended to work, a more comprehensive explanation of the treatment's mechanism of action is lacking."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of taping for plantar fasciitis. It mentions that the taping method aims to support the foot arch and provide relief from plantar fasciitis symptoms, which can be considered a short-term benefit. However, it does not explicitly discuss long-term benefits or benefits related to controlling, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition. The video focuses more on demonstrating the taping technique itself rather than comprehensively covering the potential benefits."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential downsides associated with the taping treatment for plantar fasciitis. It mentions that taping is a temporary solution and not a permanent fix, implying that it has limitations. However, it does not explicitly discuss any side-effects, complications, or adverse reactions that could potentially arise from prolonged or improper taping. The video focuses more on the technique and intended benefits of taping rather than delving into the risks. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as it addresses the limitations of taping to some extent, but does not comprehensively cover the potential risks or negative outcomes."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of not treating plantar fasciitis or postponing/forgoing treatment. The video focuses entirely on demonstrating a taping technique to provide temporary support and relief for plantar fasciitis symptoms. There is no mention of what could happen if the condition is left untreated or if treatment is delayed or avoided altogether."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any reference to how the taping treatment described affects overall quality of life or day-to-day activity. The focus is solely on explaining the taping technique and its purpose of supporting the foot arch to provide relief from plantar fasciitis pain. There is no mention of how this treatment impacts the patient's ability to perform daily activities or their general quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for plantar fasciitis, but the information is somewhat incomplete.

While the video focuses on demonstrating a taping technique as a temporary treatment option for plantar fasciitis, it does mention that strengthening exercises are also needed and that taping should not be relied upon as a permanent solution. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive discussion of other potential treatment options or when each option might be most appropriate.

The video states that taping can provide temporary relief from plantar fasciitis by supporting the arch, but it does not clearly describe the circumstances under which taping would be the most beneficial treatment choice compared to other options. It also does not suggest investigating or considering alternative treatments in depth before deciding on taping.

Overall, while the video acknowledges that taping is a temporary measure and that strengthening is also needed, it does not thoroughly explore the range"," 2

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The video primarily focuses on demonstrating a taping technique for plantar fasciitis, and does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. However, it does mention that taping is a temporary solution and that strengthening exercises are also needed, which could potentially lead to a discussion about other treatment options with a healthcare provider. Additionally, the videographer (Griffin) provides feedback on how the taping feels, which could be seen as a form of shared decision-making. Overall, while the video does not directly encourage shared decision-making, it touches on some related concepts.",set()

Most people when they come in to complain state that the ankles are turning inward. When the reality is it's actually the talus bone within the ankle that is going down and inward. Here we see her walking at normal speed. Notice the toes also trying to help out. And the just complete collapse of her arch and where her ankles are. We're going to see shortly what she looks like after reconstruction and correction. Here you really see how devastating this flat foot is. This is also very mentally challenging for patients, especially women. Now this is her after she had her right side done. About four months after surgery. You can see the comparison between the right and the left. She's still not walking quite normally yet because of the imbalance of only having one foot corrected. But there's a pretty stark difference between both. Now you'll see the amazing transformation that Lorelei underwent having these procedures done. And now that her muscles have acclimated to the new position. Her knees are in better position. Her gait is significantly improved. She can function now. This truly was a remarkable transformation for Lorelei both mentally and physically. You're now going to hear from Lorelei who's a bit on the shy side. But I think you'll see one happy patient despite going through what she did. Which ultimately will give her happy and healthy feet and legs for the rest of her life. I would encourage you to go back and look through the previous video to really see and compare the before and afters. Thank you. We're over a year out since your flat foot reconstruction on both feet, correct? And I just wanted to ask you one question. If this surgery changed your life, if so, how did it from before you had surgery to now? It changed my life a lot because before I was having a lot of pain and it hurt to walk and run. And now it's not such a bad problem. It's getting better. And how about from just the mental aspect of it for you? By that I mean, you know, when you had those really flat feet, were you depressed about it? Were you unhappy? Did you notice it? I mean, now that you have feet that are not flat anymore, is there any difference there? I noticed it when I wore shoes that the shoes would cave in on the inside and I didn't like that. Okay. I don't know. That upset me. Okay. And is that happening anymore? No. No. So your shoes are not breaking down on you? Yeah. Okay. And so for anyone with flat feet like yours, you would say this is definitely something they should do? Yeah. I understand that when you were doing cheerleading, that when you would take your shoes off, some of the kids would make fun of you. Is that true? Yes. I'm sure that didn't go over so well.

Explanation:
The video transcript appears to be focused on promoting a specific surgical procedure for treating flat feet (flatfoot reconstruction/correction), and it presents a single patient case study to showcase the benefits of this treatment. While the patient's positive outcome and improved quality of life are highlighted, there is no mention of alternative treatment options, potential risks or drawbacks associated with the surgery, or any counterbalancing perspectives.

The transcript is written from a personal point of view, likely by the surgeon or medical professional who performed the procedure, and it lacks references to multiple research studies or expert opinions. The language used is somewhat emotive and promotional, emphasizing the ""amazing transformation"" and ""remarkable"" results achieved for this particular patient.

While the patient's testimonial provides a firsthand account of the benefits experienced, the overall presentation lacks a balanced discussion of various treatment approaches, potential complications, or a broader examination of the evidence"," 1

Explanation: No additional sources of information or support are provided in the video transcript. The transcript solely focuses on describing a patient's experience with flat foot surgery and her recovery process. There are no suggestions for further reading or details about other organizations that could provide advice and information related to the topic of flat feet or foot surgeries."," 5

The video transcript does refer to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for flat feet. While it primarily focuses on the positive outcomes and transformation achieved through the surgery performed on the patient Lorelei, there is an acknowledgment that the decision to undergo such a procedure can be mentally challenging, especially for women. This implies a recognition of the potential uncertainties or difficulties involved in making the choice to proceed with this treatment option. The transcript states: ""This is also very mentally challenging for patients, especially women."" By highlighting this aspect, the video acknowledges the existence of uncertainties or concerns that patients may face when considering this treatment approach."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how the flat foot reconstruction surgery worked to correct Lorelei's condition, such as realigning the talus bone and restoring the arch of her feet. However, it does not go into specific details about the mechanisms by which the surgery achieves these effects (e.g., the surgical techniques used, how the bones and soft tissues are repositioned, etc.). The focus is more on the before-and-after results and the impact on Lorelei's quality of life. Therefore, I would rate this as a partial description of how the treatment works, warranting a score of 2."," 4

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the flat foot reconstruction surgery that Lorelei underwent. It mentions several benefits, such as:

1. Improved gait and ability to function normally after the surgery.
2. Elimination of pain and discomfort while walking and running.
3. Improved mental well-being, as Lorelei no longer feels self-conscious about the appearance of her feet, and her shoes no longer cave in on the inside.
4. Elimination of bullying or teasing from others due to the appearance of her flat feet.

However, the transcript does not explicitly mention any benefits related to preventing recurrence of the condition or eliminating it in the long term. It focuses more on the immediate improvements in symptoms and quality of life after the surgery."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks of the treatment for flat feet reconstruction surgery. It does not explicitly mention specific side-effects, complications, or adverse reactions. However, it does indirectly allude to some potential risks or challenges by mentioning that the recovery process can be mentally challenging for patients, especially women. The patient also mentions experiencing pain before the surgery, which implies that pain may have been a potential risk or side-effect of the condition itself, which the surgery aimed to address. Additionally, the video shows the patient's gait and foot positioning before and after the surgery, suggesting that there may have been a period of adjustment or recovery involved. Overall, while the video does not provide a comprehensive list of risks, it hints at some potential challenges or difficulties associated with the condition and the treatment process."," 5

The transcript clearly describes the benefits of getting treatment (surgery) for flat feet, as opposed to not receiving any treatment. It highlights the improvements in physical functioning, reduction in pain, and better mental well-being after the surgery, contrasting with the difficulties and negative experiences the patient faced before the treatment. While it does not explicitly discuss the risks of forgoing treatment, it provides a vivid depiction of the negative impacts of living with untreated flat feet, implying the potential risks of not addressing the condition. Therefore, the transcript effectively conveys the benefits of seeking treatment and the drawbacks of not receiving treatment, warranting the highest score of 5."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment (flat foot reconstruction surgery) affects the overall quality of life for the patient, Lorelei. It mentions that the surgery helped alleviate her pain and improved her ability to walk and run, which are important aspects of daily activity and quality of life. Additionally, it touches on the mental and emotional impact of having flat feet, mentioning that it was ""mentally challenging"" for Lorelei and that she felt upset when her shoes would cave in due to her flat feet. The video also suggests that the surgery helped improve her self-confidence by eliminating the issue of her shoes breaking down and the teasing she experienced from others due to her flat feet.

However, the information provided about the impact on quality of life is somewhat limited and not thoroughly explored. The video does not go into great detail about how the surgery specifically affected Lorelei's day-to-day activities or her overall well-"," 5

Explanation: The video clearly indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet. While it primarily focuses on the surgical reconstruction procedure that Lorelei underwent, it also mentions that she had tried other treatments before resorting to surgery, as evidenced by the statement ""Now that her muscles have acclimated to the new position."" This implies that there were non-surgical treatments or exercises attempted initially. Additionally, the video concludes with Lorelei recommending the surgery to anyone with flat feet like hers, suggesting that surgery may not be the appropriate choice for all cases of flat feet. Therefore, the video makes it clear that there are multiple treatment options available, and the choice depends on the severity of the condition and the individual's circumstances."," 3

Explanation: The video partially provides support for shared decision-making. While it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment options with family, friends, or healthcare professionals, it does showcase the patient's experience and outcome after undergoing a surgical procedure for flat feet.

The transcript clearly explains what flat feet are, the potential problems and symptoms associated with flat feet, and mentions that the clinic takes a holistic approach to treating flat feet by addressing the whole body, including the hips, knees, and ankles, before targeting the feet muscles specifically.

However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, and the promotional aspect of the video (promoting the clinic's services) is not directly mentioned but rather implied through the language used (""we hope you choose us on your healing journey"").

Overall, while the aims are not crystal clear from the beginning, they can be reasonably inferred from the content of the transcript."," 4

The video transcript provides a decent amount of information about flat feet, including its definition, potential causes, associated symptoms, and a brief overview of the treatment approach offered by the clinic. However, it falls short of comprehensively covering all the information one might expect from a description of the aims related to flat feet.

While the transcript explains what flat feet are and mentions some potential problems, it does not provide a detailed list of all the possible symptoms or complications associated with this condition. Additionally, the treatment approach is only briefly touched upon, without delving into specific exercises, therapies, or techniques that might be employed.

Furthermore, the video does not address any preventive measures, risk factors, or potential long-term consequences of untreated flat feet. It also does not discuss the various types or severities of flat feet or any diagnostic methods used to assess the condition.

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to flat feet. The video appears to be promoting the services offered by the organization ""Rehab and Revive"" for treating flat feet, but it does not suggest any further reading materials or other organizations that could provide advice and information on the topic."," 1

The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for flat feet. It provides a straightforward explanation of what flat feet are, the potential problems they can cause, and the general approach the clinic takes in treating flat feet (addressing the whole body, improving walking patterns, strengthening supporting structures, and exercises to reconstruct the arch muscles). However, it does not discuss any differences in expert opinion or uncertainties around the specific treatment options or their effectiveness."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatments work, but some details are missing or unclear.

The transcript mentions that the treatments involve:

1. Working on the whole body holistically and improving walking patterns.
2. Stabilizing and enhancing the hip, knee, and ankle structures.
3. Performing exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the arch of the foot.

However, the transcript does not provide specific details on how these treatments act on the body to achieve their effects. For example, it does not explain the mechanisms by which improving walking patterns or stabilizing the hip, knee, and ankle structures can help with flat feet. Similarly, it does not describe the specific exercises or how they work to reconstruct the arch muscles.

While the transcript mentions the general approaches, it lacks a clear description of the underlying physiological mechanisms or biomechanical principles involved in these treatments for flat feet."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of treatments for flat feet. It mentions that the treatments at Rehab and Revive aim to improve walking, running, climbing stairs, and alleviate symptoms like plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and heel pain. However, it does not explicitly state the specific benefits of each individual treatment or modality they offer. The benefits are described in a more general sense for their overall approach, but not broken down for each specific treatment."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments for flat feet. While it does not explicitly mention any risks or side effects, it acknowledges the potential issues or symptoms that can arise from flat feet, such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and heel pain. However, it does not provide details on the risks or side effects associated with the specific treatments or exercises mentioned for addressing flat feet."," 1

The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of not treating flat feet or pursuing a ""no treatment"" approach such as watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The video focuses on describing what flat feet is, some potential symptoms, and promoting the clinic's treatment approach without discussing what could happen if no treatment is pursued."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially addresses the overall quality of life in relation to the treatment choices for flat feet. It mentions that flat feet can cause problems with activities like ""pushing, running, walking well, climbing stairs,"" which could impact one's day-to-day activity and quality of life. However, the transcript does not explicitly describe how the proposed treatment choices, such as exercises and strategies for walking patterns and stabilizing other structures, would affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The information provided is somewhat unclear or incomplete in terms of directly addressing the effects of the treatment choices on overall quality of life."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet, but the information is unclear or incomplete. The transcript mentions that their approach at ""Rehab and Revive"" involves working on the whole body holistically, improving walking patterns, and stabilizing the hip, knee, and ankle structures before targeting the feet with exercises to reconstruct the arch muscles. However, it does not explicitly describe alternative treatment options or provide clear guidance on who might benefit from their approach versus other potential treatments. The video seems focused on promoting their specific treatment approach without contrasting it with other choices or discussing circumstances where alternatives might be more suitable."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited.

Explanation:
The transcript suggests that the video discusses treatment options for flat feet, such as exercises and strategies to improve walking patterns and strengthen the muscles supporting the arch. However, there is no explicit mention of involving the patient in the decision-making process or discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals.

The video appears to be focused on promoting the services offered by the facility (""Rehab and Revive"") rather than encouraging shared decision-making. While it provides information about the condition and potential treatments, it does not directly suggest involving others in the decision-making process or considering alternative treatment options.

Therefore, the video partially supports shared decision-making by providing educational information about the condition and potential treatments, but it does not explicitly encourage shared decision-making or discussing treatment choices with others.",set()
jzJZRl4tN4M,"You've probably heard the term flatfoot or pes planus. I'm sure you've even heard some of your friends or colleagues discussing the flatfoot as well. And I'm sure there's a few of you out there who've been diagnosed with having a flatfoot. As a podiatrist, it's one of the questions that I most often get asked. Do I have a flatfoot? My name is Gerard. I'm a podiatrist here at Singapore General Hospital. Let me tell you a little bit more about flatfoot. Flatfoot is a common condition that affects the Asian population. Estimates suggest it occurs one in every five individuals. To identify someone with flat feet, you need to observe the way a person stands or walks. During standing or walking, those with flat feet tend to flatten their inner foot or arch. Furthermore, the foot may roll over to the inner side. However, for children under the ages of 10 who may not have fully developed foot arches, assessing whether a child has flatfoot can be difficult. There are a number of contributing factors for flat feet. Often hereditary causes may contribute to having certain tight or weak muscles or even ligament laxity. Also, poor footwear can play a major role in causing flat feet. For example, wearing shoes that limit toe movements such as high heels when young can lead to flat feet in adulthood. Having a flat foot does not necessarily increase the incidence of injury, nor does it usually cause a problem. However, flat feet may put a strain on your muscles, ligaments and joints, which can cause pain in your feet, legs, hips and back when you stand or walk. Furthermore, individuals with flat feet tend to develop tired or aching feet after prolonged periods of walking or standing. Treatment is only required if the flat foot causes pain in the foot or lower limb. Besides treatment, there are exercises you can do to improve your flat foot condition. It is important to perform these exercises in a safe and comfortable position. Stop immediately and inform your podiatrist if you experience any pain. To ensure your safety is maintained during exercise, pick an appropriate time to do the exercises. Be well rested and ensure your symptoms are well controlled by your medication. Exercise at your own pace. Avoid jerking or bouncing, instead maintain a comfortable and sustained stretch. Perform these exercises several times at one go and do them repeatedly throughout the day. Sit barefoot in a chair and place a small hand towel on the floor in front of you. Place the ball of your foot on the edge of the towel and reaching out with your toes as far as you can, grab the towel and scrunch it back towards you, bunching it under your foot. Keep reaching out and grabbing more towel until you run out. Repeat on the other foot. Stand on a step with only the ball of your foot on the board and the rest of your heel and foot hanging slightly below the toes. Start with your foot in a neutral position and raise up to your tiptoes by pressing down with your toes. When you lower, resist the urge to drop to your heel too far below the stair line. Do three sets of stair raises ten times per set. Stretching your calf muscles can help loosen tight calf muscles that contributes to a flat foot. To stretch your calf and Achilles tendon, sit on the floor with your legs fully extended in an L shaped position and your toes pointing upwards. Place a towel or TheraBand over your forefoot and hold. Pull it towards you. You should feel the stretch at the back of your left leg below the knee. Hold the stretch for twenty to thirty seconds and repeat with the opposite leg. Repeat the stretch three times on each leg and do this exercise three to four times daily. Start with your foot. Place flat on the floor. Try raising all ten toes upwards. Hold for five seconds. Then relax and repeat ten times. Hip weakness can contribute to flat feet so it's also important to strengthen the muscles that control the outward movement of the leg. This helps to ensure that the joints of the leg stay in proper alignment. One such exercise is side lying leg raises. Begin by lying on your side with one arm bent and resting under your head. Keep both legs straight with your bottom leg touching the ground while raising your top leg one feet above your bottom leg. Hold for two seconds then return the leg to the ground to complete one rep. Perform a total of ten reps three times a day. Don't let flat feet ruin your quality of life. Get treatment today and do the exercises regularly. Start today and you can be pain free from flat foot.",Flat Feet,4,4,4,2,2,3,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,4,2," 4

It also outlines several exercises that can help alleviate the condition. However, the aims of the video are not explicitly stated, so it's difficult to determine if all the intended information has been provided. Nevertheless, the transcript covers a wide range of relevant topics related to flat feet, suggesting that it likely achieves its aims to a large extent, hence the score of 4."," 4 (Partially relevant)

Explanation:
The video transcript provides relevant information about flat feet (pes planus), including its prevalence, causes, symptoms, and treatment options. It also describes some exercises that can help alleviate the condition. However, the information is quite broad and may not address all the specific questions or concerns that readers might have about flat feet. For example, there is no mention of the potential long-term consequences of untreated flat feet or specific details on different treatment options (e.g., orthotics, surgery). Additionally, the video does not cover potential complications or when it may be necessary to seek medical attention.

Explanation:

The video transcript provides a balanced overview of flatfoot (pes planus) condition, including its prevalence, causes, symptoms, and potential treatments. It also offers several exercises that can help alleviate the condition. However, there are a few aspects that suggest some bias or lack of objectivity:

1. The video seems to be focused primarily on promoting a particular treatment approach (exercises) without much discussion or comparison with other potential treatment options, such as orthotics, arch supports, or in severe cases, surgery.

2. While the video mentions that treatment is only required if the flat foot causes pain, it does not provide a clear distinction between when conservative treatments like exercises are appropriate versus when more interventional approaches may be necessary.

The video partially refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for flat feet. While it discusses various treatment options, such as exercises and stretches, it does not explicitly mention any gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning these treatment choices. However, the video does acknowledge that treatment is only required if the flat foot causes pain, suggesting that there may be uncertainty or differing opinions on when treatment is necessary. Additionally, the video advises seeking professional guidance from a podiatrist, which implies that there may be uncertainties or nuances in determining the appropriate treatment approach. Therefore, while the video does not directly discuss uncertainties, it indirectly acknowledges potential areas of uncertainty by highlighting the need for professional evaluation and tailored treatment approaches."," 3

The transcript provides some descriptions of how the recommended treatments and exercises work to address flat feet, but the details are limited and incomplete.

It mentions that exercises can improve the flat foot condition, strengthen muscles, and loosen tight calf muscles that contribute to flat feet. However, it does not go into depth about the specific mechanisms by which the exercises act on the body to correct flat feet.

For the towel scrunching exercise, it describes the motion but not how that motion helps address flat feet. Similarly, for the calf stretches and toe raises, it describes the movements but does not explain how those particular movements help treat flat feet.

The leg raise exercise is explained as helping to strengthen muscles that control leg alignment, which can contribute to flat feet, but the details are still quite general.

For lack of a better terminology, she's walking like a duck or Charlie Chaplin. And you can see the gross deformity here. She's not able to function very well and this is a poorly functioning foot. Participating in any sporting activity is almost impossible, yet she has been a real trooper and trying to persevere. And she was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of this problem. And as you can see, that's not the case. We're now going to see the post-operative results on the right here. You can see the straight line that I drew showing the new position of the foot. Again, here we're looking on your left side, which is the right foot. We're seeing a much straighter foot with a restoration of the arch. Again, we're seeing the arch on the right foot, which is pretty dramatic, relative to the left side, which shows here no arch and a completely collapsed foot, which is not functional at all. In this picture, we're looking at the titanium calcaneal graft that was put in here to lengthen the lateral column and help restore the arch. And now we're looking at the top of the foot where a similar graft was placed into the menial cuneiform to help bring the arch more prominent. This is the preoperative x-ray where you'll note the lines that I've drawn that help indicate the deformity. Looking at the red line below in the blue, and now we can see that little blue line near the implant is now elevated along with the arch. And we can see all the implants in the foot that brought the arch up. This is the before picture where you see the foot is completely turning outward and the proximal portion is going inward. And this is the postoperative result, which is very dramatic. You can see the foot is perfectly straight now and looks much better as it did in the video. Here we're looking at her walk now three months out, which has just only been walking now for a couple of weeks, and already it's dramatic the improvement.

The video transcript provides detailed information about a specific medical condition affecting the feet and the surgical procedure performed to correct it. While it is highly relevant and informative for anyone interested in learning about this particular foot deformity and its treatment, it does not address general medical questions that a broader audience might have.

The transcript covers the following relevant aspects:

1. Description of the severe foot deformity and its impact on the patient's mobility and ability to participate in physical activities.
2. Explanation of the surgical procedure involving the use of titanium implants to restore the arch and realign the foot.
3. Comparison of pre-operative and post-operative X-rays, highlighting the dramatic improvement achieved through the surgery.

The transcript provides some information about how the treatment (surgery) affects the patient's ability to walk and potentially participate in sporting activities, which relates to overall quality of life. However, the information is limited and does not go into detailed descriptions of how the treatment choices impact day-to-day activities or other aspects of quality of life beyond walking/mobility. The focus is primarily on the technical details of the surgical procedure and the before-and-after physical appearance of the foot. Therefore, the score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as there is a reference to overall quality of life in relation to treatment choices, but the information is incomplete and lacks depth."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript discusses a specific surgical treatment for severe foot deformity, but it does not explicitly mention or describe any alternative treatment choices. While the transcript provides detailed information about the surgical procedure and its results, it does not compare or contrast this approach with other potential treatment options. The focus is solely on the described surgical intervention, without suggesting that there may be other viable treatment choices to consider or investigate further. Therefore, the video does not make it very clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for this condition, warranting a score of 2 (Partially)."," 2

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The transcript primarily focuses on the technical details of the medical procedure and its results, with little direct suggestion for discussing treatment choices with others.

The only potential reference to shared decision-making is the statement ""She was told by pediatricians early on that she would grow out of this problem. And as you can see, that's not the case."" This implies that the patient (or her parents) may have received advice from healthcare professionals earlier, which did not align with the eventual need for treatment.

However, there are no explicit recommendations or encouragement to discuss treatment options with family, friends, or healthcare professionals. The transcript is primarily descriptive of the medical condition and the surgical procedure performed, without addressing the decision-making process or the involvement of others.

While the video may provide educational value regarding the medical condition and treatment, it lacks clear support for the concept of shared decision-",set()
BuQdGkBXJOk,"Hey, have you tried a bunch of stretches to try to fix your flat feet but nothing seems to work? Well, today I'm going to show you one key stretch that I use to go from this to this. Hi, I'm Vincent from Upright Health where we help you think right, move right, and feel right. If you're new to the channel, be sure to check out the description box below for helpful links to our do-it-yourself programs. So the stretch in question is the hero pose. I'm going to show you how to do it. I'm going to show you some modifications you can try to optimize it for your body. Then I'm going to explain to you why its proper execution is crucial to improving your flat feet. So to set up for this pose, I'm going to start in tall kneeling position with my heels slightly outside of my knees and my toes pointing inward. Next, I'm going to get onto my hands and knees and slowly rock my butt back towards my heels. My butt should be landing inside of my heels so that my heels will eventually be touching the outside of my butt when I get all the way down. And my toes should still be pointing inward as I get into the full pose. Once I'm in the full pose, I'm going to aim to lengthen my spine so that when seen from the side I've got that nice neutral spine shape. I can do some anterior and posterior pelvic tilts going back and forth between the extremes to find what feels neutral, to find the zone where my sit bones feel like they're directly underneath of the rest of my spine. And from there, I'm going to try to relax as much as I can as I feel this super intense stretch around my shins and the top of my ankles. So for this stretch, I like to stay in it for as long as it takes to feel something change. That may take two minutes, it may take five minutes, it may take ten minutes. For example, when I first get into this stretch, I may not feel anything stretch around my hips, but if I allow myself to stay in it for long enough, sometimes I'll feel something let go that I did not even realize was holding tension before. So this doesn't just apply to the hips, sometimes I'll feel it in my quads, sometimes I'll feel it in my calves or my feet. Each time, I'm just aiming to feel like something has changed from the time that I got into the stretch to the time that I get out of it. And when you're done, just get out of it in a way that makes sense to you. So modifications for this stretch. If you're having a ton of discomfort getting all the way down, then what you can do is grab a couple of yoga blocks or anything that will allow you to sit your weight down without bending your knees all the way. But the key points, the key points from the full pose still apply here. So trying to keep the ankles outside of the butt, still trying to point the toes in and keep a long spine once you've rested your weight on the yoga blocks. Another modification you can try once you're comfortable with the version shown prior is you can start leaning back further and further until your back is resting all the way on the floor. But the same key points apply. You're still trying to keep your heels outside of your butt and your toes pointed inward. So now let's go into the why of this exercise. If you watched another video we made on foot training, you will remember that the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot are one, a vertical Achilles tendon and two, a foot tripod. If you have flat feet, then when you're walking around your Achilles tendon is going to be collapsed inward and your whole foot is not going to be a tripod. This exercise addresses that by improving your ability to move your Achilles tendon outward while planting your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor. How is this relevant? Well consider that if you develop the strength to roll your ankle outwards and get that Achilles tendon to be vertical, but that this causes your entire foot to lift off the floor, then you don't have that tripod anymore. To get that tripod back, you need to be able to press your big toe mound into the floor while maintaining that vertical Achilles tendon. And this exercise, it does just that. By pinning your big toe mound and your little toe mound into the floor as you sit back on your ankles that are rolled out, you're improving your ability to get at the conditions of success of a strong and stable foot. So that does it for this stretch. If you'd like to check out the exercise that this stretch pairs extremely well with, click the link. And if you found the video helpful, please like the video, comment, share it with anyone you know who may also find it helpful, subscribe to the channel, and as always, remember that pain sucks, life shouldn't. I think showing that whole sequence of me getting out of it is not slowly. I think that could be valuable. Now there's gonna be... Somebody's like, how do I get out of this stretch?",Flat Feet,5,4,4,2,1,4,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,2," 5

The aims of the video are clear. The transcript indicates that the video aims to:

1) Teach a specific stretch called the ""hero pose"" for addressing flat feet.
2) Explain how to properly perform the stretch and provide modifications. 
3) Explain why this stretch is beneficial for improving flat feet by targeting the conditions for a strong, stable foot (vertical Achilles tendon and foot tripod).

The introduction clearly sets up that the video will show ""one key stretch"" for flat feet. The transcript then methodically covers how to do the stretch, modifications, and the rationale/benefits related to flat foot correction. The aims are stated upfront and consistently followed through in the content."," 4

The video transcript provides most of the information one would expect from a description aimed at showing a stretch to help with flat feet. It clearly demonstrates how to perform the ""hero pose"" stretch, including proper form, modifications, and the reasoning behind why this stretch is beneficial for improving flat feet condition.

The explanation of how the stretch helps address the underlying issues of flat feet - by improving the ability to roll the ankles outward and maintain a vertical Achilles tendon while keeping the foot tripod - is well-detailed and informative.

However, the video seems to lack specific information on getting out of the stretch position safely, which was mentioned as something that could have been valuable to include.

Overall, while not perfect, the transcript covers the core aims of demonstrating and explaining the stretch thoroughly, hence a score of 4 out of 5 seems appropriate."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about a specific stretch (the hero pose) that is claimed to be helpful for addressing flat feet. It explains how to perform the stretch, provides modifications, and discusses the rationale behind how the stretch can improve foot mechanics and posture related to flat feet. However, the information is focused solely on this one exercise, without covering other potential treatments, causes, or broader context about flat feet. Therefore, while relevant for someone specifically looking for an exercise to help with flat feet, it may not fully address all potential questions readers could have about flat feet in general. Hence, a score of 4 (Partially relevant) is appropriate."," 2

The video provides some explanation and reasoning behind the recommended stretch and its proposed benefits for flat feet, drawing from what seems to be the author's own expertise or approach. However, there are no explicit references or citations to external sources like research studies or expert opinions to back up the key claims made about the causes of flat feet and how this stretch addresses those issues. The ""why"" section refers to concepts like the Achilles tendon angle and foot tripod, but does not attribute these ideas to any particular sources beyond the author's own previous video. While the practical instruction seems sound, the lack of referenced evidence for the underlying rationale means the sourcing is only partially clear."," 1

The transcript only contains the instructional content of the video itself, without mentioning any dates related to the information sources or research cited."," 4 (Partially balanced and unbiased)

Explanation:

The video appears to be focused on promoting a specific stretch (the ""hero pose"") for addressing flat feet, presented from a personal perspective based on the presenter's experience. While the information is conveyed in a balanced and instructional manner, with explanations of how the stretch works and modifications for different ability levels, there are a few potential biases to consider:

1. The video does not provide a comprehensive overview of other treatment options or exercises for flat feet, focusing solely on the benefits of this one stretch.

2. The claims about the effectiveness of the stretch for improving flat feet condition are not explicitly backed by citations from research studies or input from other medical experts. The rationale provided is based on the presenter's own understanding and experience.

3. While the presenter mentions a previous video on ""foot training,"" there is no clear indication that a range of sources or experts were consulted in comp"," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to the topic of flat feet exercises or stretches. The video focuses solely on demonstrating and explaining a specific stretch (the hero pose) for addressing flat feet. There are no suggestions for further reading materials or other organizations that provide advice and information on this topic."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for flat feet. It provides a detailed explanation of how to perform the ""hero pose"" stretch and the rationale behind why it may help improve flat feet condition. However, there is no discussion of differences in expert opinion or alternative treatment options. The video seems to present the stretch as a recommended exercise without acknowledging any uncertainties or limitations."," 3

The video partially describes how the hero pose stretch works to address flat feet. It explains that the stretch aims to improve the ability to roll the ankles outward and plant the big toe and little toe mounds into the floor, which are described as conditions for a strong and stable foot. However, it does not provide detailed physiological explanations of how the stretch specifically acts on the body's muscles, tendons, or other structures to achieve this effect.

The video focuses more on demonstrating the proper form and providing modifications for the stretch rather than an in-depth explanation of the underlying mechanisms by which it works. While it connects the stretch to improving foot function, the description of how it achieves this is relatively brief and high-level."," 2

Explanation:
The video partially describes the benefits of the hero pose stretch for treating flat feet. It explains how the stretch helps improve the positioning of the Achilles tendon and foot tripod, which are described as conditions for a strong and stable foot. However, the video does not explicitly mention benefits like controlling or getting rid of symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the flat feet condition in the short or long term. The focus is more on the biomechanics of how the stretch can improve foot positioning rather than its direct benefits for flat feet. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that benefits are described partially for this particular treatment."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not describe any risks, side-effects, complications or adverse reactions associated with performing the hero pose stretch or the modifications discussed.

Explanation: The transcript does not contain any reference to the overall quality of life or how the described treatment (the stretching exercise) affects day-to-day activities. The video focuses solely on explaining and demonstrating the stretching technique itself, without discussing its potential impact on the patient's quality of life or daily functioning."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet, but the information is incomplete. While the video focuses on demonstrating and explaining the benefits of one specific stretch (the hero pose) for improving flat feet, it does not provide a clear description of who might benefit most from this treatment or under what circumstances it should be chosen over other potential treatments. The video also does not suggest or discuss any alternative treatment options to consider before deciding on this stretch. The information is focused solely on explaining and promoting this particular exercise as a solution for flat feet, without acknowledging or comparing it to other possible treatment choices."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited.

Explanation:
The video mainly focuses on demonstrating and explaining a specific stretch exercise for addressing flat feet. While it provides detailed instructions and rationale for the exercise, there is minimal direct suggestion or encouragement for discussing treatment choices with doctors, family, or other professionals. 

The only potential reference to shared decision-making is the brief mention of checking out the description box for ""helpful links to our do-it-yourself programs."" This could imply discussing self-management options with professionals, but it is not explicitly stated.

Overall, the video is more focused on providing a self-care exercise technique rather than actively promoting shared decision-making about treatment options with others. Some support for shared decision-making could be inferred, but it is not a central theme or emphasis of the video content.",set()
iKQmFoA7dsQ,"There are a number of causes of flat feet. And really the most common cause that we see is the hereditary type of flat foot that generally runs in families. Commonest type is the younger patient in their teenage or adolescent years that comes in with their parents complaining of a painless and immobile flexible flat foot. Other causes that we do see later in life usually the degenerative conditions mainly affecting the post-iliotibial tendon which will then result in gradual weakness of the foot and deformity with collapsing of the medial arch. Other conditions such as arthritic conditions and post-traumatic conditions may also present with flat foot deformities. Avoidance of flat foot deformity obviously depends on the cause and the stage of presentation. Ideally, if a patient is concerned, a full assessment by an orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist would be appropriate because the treatment may well depend on the cause and the severity. Usually, in the early stages simple orthotics and attention to correct shoe wear may help. And these would really form a medial arch support with possibly a small wedge on the inside of the orthotic and obviously a shoe with a medial support and space to fit the orthotic. If the initial stages are not manageable with simple shoe wear and orthotics, occasionally, surgery may be required.",Flat Feet,2,4,5,2,1,5,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2," 2

hBNstjxuGCg,"So a flat foot is when someone has lost the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. So on the big toe side you typically have a little bit higher arch than you do on the outside or the pinky toe side of the foot. And so when you've lost that, you can have pain on the inside of the foot or the arch of the foot, on the inside of the ankle. You tend to progressively notice that the arch will collapse. So once it starts to collapse it usually continues to progress. And you can even notice that the toes begin to kind of drift outward a little bit and point out to the side as opposed to pointing straight ahead as you're walking. The progression of flat foot takes months to years. It's not something that you would necessarily notice over days or weeks unless you have a traumatic rupture or injury that's causing a flat foot which can occur. But that's not the typical flat foot that we see. You can have a congenital flat foot and that's not something that necessarily needs treatment. In general we don't address a flat foot with orthotics or surgery unless the patient is having symptoms. If they're not having any pain or any issues with the function of their foot then it's just kind of one of those things that's the way you were made. So the reason that the medial longitudinal arch will collapse is usually contributed to by a tight calf muscle. When the calf muscle is tight and it increases the tension across the Achilles tendon that tries to point the foot like a ballet dancer and the ground as we're walking we don't walk on our tiptoes. And so because of the force of the ground and the tightness of the Achilles tendon the arch gets extra stress and over time can succumb to that stress and collapse. So treatment for flat foot is typically reserved for those patients that are having pain or are symptomatic from their flat foot. So if you're walking around and happen to know that you've had flat feet your whole life and they've never bothered you we don't even attempt to correct that. But if you're starting to have arch pain or you're having pain along the inside of the ankle or even the outside of the ankle typically again we always start with non-operative treatment. So that would be orthotics. Sometimes we can do injections however we try not to inject tendons due to risk of rupture for tendon injection and physical therapy to try and stretch out the calf muscle as well as strengthen the tendons and ligaments that are supposed to support the arch. Flat feet is something that we see often within the foot and ankle clinic. A lot of people coming in with medial arch pain or lateral ankle pain find out that they have flat feet and that is the cause. The majority of patients that come in for flat feet are able to be managed pretty well with conservative treatment that gives them pretty good pain relief and allows them to continue the activities that they enjoy. I would say probably 30% of patients end up having to go on to surgery and that increases with time. So maybe for 5-10 years you've done really well with orthotics and with physical therapy but as time progresses and your flat foot progresses eventually you reach a point where the pain is just too debilitating. Similar to a lot of other foot and ankle conditions it's up to the patient when it's time for surgery if they have a flat foot and they continue to have pain after we've tried therapy and injections then that's when we discuss surgical management. There's actually multiple different options for treatment for flat feet as far as surgical approaches depending on the flexibility of the foot and how mobile the foot remains and how easily we are able to correct the flat foot manually in the office as well as how much arthritis the patient has will determine what surgical option we choose or we recommend. Sometimes we're able to do that with what we consider to be joint sparing surgery meaning that we're not fusing any of the functional mobile joints so we don't stiffen the foot at all with surgery and it's mostly osteotomies and tendon transfers and maybe gastroc lengthening or calf muscle lengthening. However sometimes if the foot is more stiff and rigid or if arthritis has already set in or if it's an older patient we'll elect for arthrodesis which is the same as a fusion so we'll fuse the hind foot to stabilize the arch and to improve the function of the foot.",Flat Feet,5,5,5,2,1,4,1,1,2,3,2,1,2,5,2," 5

Explanation: The video transcript does not explicitly cite any external sources of information or evidence to support the claims made about flat feet, their causes, symptoms, and treatments. The information appears to be based solely on the speaker's expertise and experience as a medical professional. However, some general references are made to common practices and approaches in the field, such as using orthotics, physical therapy, injections, and surgical options as treatments. No specific research studies or expert opinions are quoted or referenced. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that the sources of evidence are partially clear, as the information is based on the speaker's medical knowledge and standard practices, but no external sources are explicitly cited."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates or years for the sources of information used to compile the video. There are no mentions of when the information or studies referenced were produced. The transcript appears to be based on the speaker's general medical knowledge and experience treating flat feet, but does not cite any dated sources."," 4

The transcript provides a balanced and informative overview of flat feet, including causes, symptoms, non-surgical treatments, and surgical options. The expert discusses various aspects of the condition from an objective medical perspective, citing different contributing factors and treatment approaches.

However, there are a few instances where personal opinions or anecdotal evidence is presented, such as ""The majority of patients that come in for flat feet are able to be managed pretty well with conservative treatment that gives them pretty good pain relief and allows them to continue the activities that they enjoy."" and ""I would say probably 30% of patients end up having to go on to surgery and that increases with time."" These statements lack specific citations or references to research studies.

Additionally, while the expert mentions different surgical options, there is no explicit comparison or discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, which could introduce some bias towards certain treatments.

Overall, the information is largely balanced and unbiased, but the"," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information regarding flat feet. It only discusses the condition itself, its causes, symptoms, and treatment options, including non-surgical and surgical approaches. There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information about flat feet."," 1

The transcript does not explicitly mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for flat feet. It provides a detailed overview of the causes, symptoms, and various treatment options (both non-surgical and surgical) for flat feet, but does not discuss any uncertainties or differences in expert opinion concerning these treatment choices. The information presented appears to be factual and definitive without acknowledging any uncertainties or areas of debate."," 2

Explanation:
The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments for flat feet work, but it lacks comprehensive explanations for all the mentioned treatments. Here's a breakdown:

1. It explains that orthotics can help provide pain relief for flat feet, but does not describe how orthotics work on the body to achieve this effect.

2. It mentions that physical therapy aims to stretch the calf muscle and strengthen the tendons and ligaments that support the arch, but does not provide details on how this corrects or alleviates the flat foot condition.

3. It states that injections are sometimes used, but does not specify what is injected or how it works.

4. For surgical treatments, it mentions osteotomies (bone cuts), tendon transfers, gastroc (calf muscle) lengthening, and arthrodesis (fusion), but does not describe the mechanisms by which these procedures correct or improve the"," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of different treatments for flat feet. It mentions that orthotics, physical therapy, and injections can provide pain relief and allow patients to continue their activities, indicating the benefits of these non-surgical treatments. However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of surgical treatments, other than mentioning that surgery may be recommended if non-surgical treatments fail to provide adequate relief. The transcript discusses different surgical options but does not clearly outline the specific benefits of each surgical approach."," 2

The transcript describes some potential risks of treatments for flat feet, but does not comprehensively cover the risks for each treatment mentioned.

The only risk explicitly mentioned is the risk of tendon rupture from injections, stated here: ""Sometimes we can do injections however we try not to inject tendons due to risk of rupture for tendon injection...""

No risks or potential complications are described for other treatments like orthotics, physical therapy, osteotomies, tendon transfers, gastroc lengthening, or arthrodesis/fusion surgeries.

So while one risk is noted for injections, the transcript does not describe risks for the other treatments covered like orthotics, physical therapy, and the various surgical options. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, since risks are only mentioned for one treatment but not comprehensively across all treatments discussed."," 1

The transcript does not provide a clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating flat feet or postponing treatment. The focus is primarily on explaining what flat feet are, potential causes, and available treatment options (both non-surgical and surgical). There is no explicit mention of what could happen if no treatment is pursued, or the potential consequences of delaying treatment or adopting a ""watchful waiting"" approach. The closest reference is the statement that if a patient is not experiencing any pain or functional issues with their flat feet, then no treatment is necessary. However, this does not directly address the risks or benefits of forgoing treatment."," 2

The transcript provides some information about how treatment choices for flat feet may affect day-to-day activity and overall quality of life, but the information is incomplete or unclear.

The video mentions that for patients with symptomatic flat feet, non-operative treatments like orthotics, injections, and physical therapy are typically tried first to provide pain relief and allow patients to continue their activities. It also notes that about 30% of patients may eventually need surgery if conservative treatments are insufficient in managing debilitating pain over time.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the specific effects of the various treatment options on overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. It mainly focuses on explaining the condition, causes, and available treatment approaches without going into detail about how each option impacts a patient's ability to perform daily activities or their overall quality of life.

So while there are references to treatments aiming to relieve pain and allow patients to continue their activities,"," 5

The video clearly indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet. It describes both non-surgical and surgical options, and mentions that the specific surgical approach depends on factors such as the flexibility of the foot, the presence of arthritis, and the patient's age. The video suggests that non-surgical treatments like orthotics, injections, and physical therapy are typically tried first, and surgery is considered if the patient continues to experience debilitating pain despite conservative treatment. It also mentions that surgical options can range from joint-sparing procedures like osteotomies and tendon transfers, to more extensive procedures like arthrodesis (fusion) for stiffer, arthritic feet or older patients. The video provides a clear overview of the different treatment choices and the circumstances under which each may be appropriate, indicating that the treatment approach is tailored to the individual patient's condition and needs."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited.

Explanation:
The transcript discusses different treatment options for flat feet, including non-surgical options such as orthotics, injections, and physical therapy, as well as surgical options like osteotomies, tendon transfers, and fusions. It mentions that the choice of surgical approach depends on factors like foot flexibility, mobility, and the presence of arthritis.

However, the transcript does not explicitly suggest discussing these treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. It merely states that the decision for surgery is ""up to the patient"" if conservative treatments fail to provide relief.

While the video provides information about different treatment options, it lacks a clear encouragement for shared decision-making involving discussions with others. Therefore, it only partially supports shared decision-making, warranting a score of 2-4.",set()
iwX4_G6JZ_0,"Hello, my name is Lewis and I'm a podiatrist at East Coast Podiatry in Singapore and today we're talking about common problems associated with flatfoot. What is a flatfoot? So we've identified that this foot type is flat and what we tend to see is a flatfoot is more in an everted position like this. It's incredibly common, typically we see this a lot in children, especially of Asian descent. So typically, hypermobile flatfoot, which means very flexible, flexible in the joints, the knees, the arms can link to flatfoot. So the number one problem that we see with flatfoot is plantar heel pain. So with a flatfoot that's typically very flexible, we can stress the plantar muscles and tendons and ligaments on the bottom of the foot. So most commonly what we see in my clinic is plantar fasciitis or plantar heel pain, which is very common associated with flatfoot. Another problem we see very often is bunions. So due to the foot being in this position here, we can get a bunion formation on the big toe joint. Now this can be very painful. However, the good news is it can be addressed quite quickly, conservatively, if it's found at an early stage before it develops. So for us, what we look at doing is we identify the problem, okay? We identify why the problem is there and what's the root cause of it, and then we would manage that conservatively. High archfoot is typically associated with people of Caucasian descent. High archfoot is associated also with being stiff. So we see flexible flatfoot and we see often a rigid high archfoot. The rigidity and flexibility are both different. It's not better or worse. We just see different problems. What we would see more commonly an ankle sprain with a flatfoot. With a higher archfoot, we're much more likely to get shock impacts to the heel, Achilles tendon problems, and also we can get ankle sprains or even fractures as well. So high archfoot, the common problems that we see is heel pain because the calves tend to be very, very tight and we impact the ground very, very firmly with no shock absorption. Another one is arthritis of the big toe joint. This again associated with the stiffness means that with a rigid foot, we don't have the natural shock absorption and we smash the big toe into the ground, especially with runners. So lots of marathon runners, heel pain and knee pain with high archfoot is what we see. Typically for us, what we want to do is when patients come into my clinic and they say, Lewis, I've got a high archfoot or I've got a certain pain here. Once we've established the root cause of it and that we are dealing with a high archfoot, we then need to determine whether we need treatment or not. Now, these problems that I'm talking about, such as Achilles tendonitis at the back and the arthritis of the big toe at the front are very common. And we can actually address these conservatively without the need for steroids or injections or medication if we address it at the right time. So if this problem is picked up quite soon, we can normally identify the problem, identify the long term management of a higher archfoot with footwear, custom insoles to take away the pressure from these high pressure areas. If you feel that you're experiencing foot and ankle pain or any discomfort in the lower limb for that matter, hip pain, knee pain, especially with sports, if you're active, if you're elderly, if you're a junior, podiatrists are the people to see. They're experts in the lower limb. So if you're having foot and ankle problems and you feel that you may have got a high archfoot or a flat foot like this or anything that we've said today has been relevant and is applicable to you, please let us know in the comments below.

The video has some clear aims stated, which are to discuss common problems associated with flatfoot and high arched foot conditions. However, the aims could have been more explicitly and concisely stated upfront. The discussion covers identifying these foot types, the differences between them, and the potential issues or pains that can arise from each condition. Treatment approaches are also briefly mentioned. While informative, the scope of the aims is a bit broad, covering multiple foot conditions rather than a single focused aim. Overall, the aims are partially clear but could benefit from being more directly articulated."," 4

The video transcript partially achieves its aims of providing information about common problems associated with flatfoot and high arched foot. It covers several key issues related to these foot types, including:

- Description of what flatfoot and high arched foot look like
- Common problems like plantar fasciitis, bunions, ankle sprains, heel pain, Achilles tendonitis, toe arthritis
- Potential causes/factors like flexibility, stiffness, shock absorption
- Treatment approaches like orthotics, proper footwear

However, it does not go into extensive detail on all the potential problems or provide comprehensive information on treatment plans. Some areas that could have been expanded:

- More specifics on stretches, exercises, or therapies recommended
- Discussion of when surgical intervention may be needed 
- Preventative measures for those predisposed to these foot types
- Clarification on differences for pediatric vs. adult patients"," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about common problems associated with flat feet and high arched feet. It addresses potential questions that readers might have regarding the causes, symptoms, and potential treatments for these foot conditions. The podiatrist explains the differences between flexible flat feet and rigid high arched feet, and the common issues associated with each, such as plantar fasciitis, bunions, ankle sprains, heel pain, and arthritis in the big toe joint.

The information is comprehensive and covers the root causes, identification, and conservative management approaches for these foot problems. However, the video does not go into extensive detail on specific treatment options or surgical interventions, which some readers might be interested in knowing more about.

Overall, the transcript is highly relevant and informative for readers seeking an understanding of common foot conditions related to flat feet and high arched feet, their causes, and potential conservative treatment approaches."," 3

Explanation: The video partially cites sources of evidence for the claims made. While the speaker does not explicitly reference any specific research studies or expert opinions, he does frequently mention his own professional expertise and experience as a podiatrist when discussing the various foot conditions and their associated problems. For example, he states ""So for us, what we look at doing is we identify the problem, okay? We identify why the problem is there and what's the root cause of it, and then we would manage that conservatively."" This implies that the information provided is based on his professional knowledge and practice as a podiatrist. However, some of the more general statements, such as those about the prevalence of flat feet in certain populations, are not explicitly supported by any cited sources. Therefore, a partial score of 3 seems appropriate, as the video relies on the speaker's stated expertise as a podiatrist for much of the information, but does not provide specific references for"," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates for the sources of information used in the video. The only date-related information given is that the video itself is current, as evident from the speaker's introduction (""Hello, my name is Lewis and I'm a podiatrist at East Coast Podiatry in Singapore and today we're talking about common problems associated with flatfoot.""). However, there are no clear dates mentioned for any studies, research, or other sources that may have been used to compile the information presented in the video.

Explanation:
The video transcript appears to be largely objective and informative, discussing common issues associated with different foot types (flatfoot and high arch foot) from a medical perspective. The speaker, a podiatrist, provides insights based on their professional expertise and clinical experience.

However, there are a few aspects that could be considered slightly biased or unbalanced:

1. The focus is primarily on the problems and potential treatments associated with flatfoot and high arch foot, without much discussion of alternative foot types or conditions.

2. While the speaker mentions conservative treatments like footwear and custom insoles, there is no explicit mention or comparison with other treatment options such as exercises, physical therapy, or surgical interventions.

3. The speaker briefly promotes their own clinic and services at the end, which could be seen as a mild bias or self-promotion.

Explanation: The transcript provides some description of how the flatfoot and high arch foot conditions can lead to certain problems like plantar fasciitis, bunions, ankle sprains, heel pain, and arthritis. However, it does not go into details about the specific mechanisms or how the treatments like custom insoles or footwear modifications work to address these conditions. The descriptions remain fairly general without explaining the underlying biomechanics or physiological processes involved. Therefore, I would rate this as a partial description of how the treatments work, warranting a score of 2."," 2

Explanation:
The video transcript describes some general benefits of treating flatfoot and high archfoot conditions, but does not provide specific benefits for each potential treatment mentioned.

For flatfoot, it mentions that plantar fasciitis/heel pain and bunions can be ""addressed quite quickly, conservatively"" if caught early, implying treating these conditions provides a benefit. However, it does not explicitly state what the benefits would be.

For high archfoot, it states that conditions like heel pain, Achilles tendonitis, and arthritis of the big toe joint ""can actually be addressed conservatively without the need for steroids or injections or medication if we address it at the right time."" This suggests treating high archfoot conservatively provides benefits over more invasive treatments, but again does not specify the actual benefits.

However, it does not go into specific details about side-effects, adverse reactions or risks of the treatments themselves like custom insoles or other conservative management approaches mentioned. The focus is more on describing the problems associated with the foot conditions rather than risks of the treatments."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for flat feet or high arched feet conditions. While the transcript mentions some common problems associated with these foot types (e.g., plantar fasciitis, bunions, ankle sprains, heel pain), it does not discuss what would happen if these conditions are left untreated or if treatment is postponed or forgone permanently. The focus of the transcript is on describing the conditions themselves and mentioning that they can often be addressed conservatively, but it does not provide details on the potential consequences of not receiving treatment."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear reference to the overall quality of life in relation to treatment choices for flatfoot or high archfoot conditions. The video primarily focuses on describing the common problems associated with these foot types, such as plantar heel pain, bunions, ankle sprains, heel pain, and arthritis of the big toe joint. While it mentions that these problems can be addressed conservatively with footwear, custom insoles, and identifying the root cause, there is no specific discussion on how these treatment choices affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of individuals with flatfoot or high archfoot conditions."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flatfeet and high arched feet, but the information is not comprehensive or detailed.

The video mentions some potential treatment options like custom insoles, addressing the root cause conservatively, and managing with proper footwear for high arched feet. For flatfeet, it suggests addressing plantar fasciitis/heel pain conservatively if caught early.

However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances each treatment might be recommended. It also does not explicitly suggest investigating or considering alternative treatments before deciding on a particular option.

While the video acknowledges different foot types (flatfeet and high arches) and some associated problems/treatments, it does not comprehensively cover the range of possible treatment choices, their suitability for different individuals/situations, or encourage exploring alternatives before making"," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is relatively limited. The podiatrist discusses common foot problems and their potential causes, which could help inform discussions with healthcare professionals about treatment options. However, there are no explicit suggestions or encouragement to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare providers. The focus is more on educating viewers about foot conditions rather than promoting shared decision-making directly.

B-pgcNdKY28,"Possibly as high as 50% of children in Asia suffer from flat foot syndrome. Many parents notice problems in their children's feet, but do not know how it should be treated. When the foot flattens in a child, it can lead to problems in the bones of the foot. A flat foot can cause the foot to pronate or roll inside, damaging the structure of the foot. This rolling in can cause the lower leg to rotate, causing pain in the foot or the knee. Flat feet can make it hard for a child to play sports. Flat feet can even interfere with a child's ability to walk normally. Balances in the feet can eventually affect the hips and the back in the developing child. At ACC, we use European technology to diagnose and treat flat feet in children. Digital scanning equipment is the most effective method of assessing the foot. Swiss digital technology is used to create a three-dimensional model of the foot. Corrections to the structure of the foot are made digitally. Swiss-made CCM mills and other equipment are used to precisely make the insert. Precise finishing work is performed by hand. Correctly made orthotics are effective in treating flat feet in children and adults. If treated early enough, flat feet in children can be corrected with foot orthotics.

9tlzxA8o0w0,"Flat feet can be observed from two years old or anytime during the adult years, where the medial arch or the inner side of the foot is lowered towards the ground. If this develops during childhood, it is congenital flat foot. If it develops during adulthood, it is adult acquired flat foot. Leaving a flat foot condition without treatment can lead to long-term chronic pain. The medial arch of the foot rolls inwards, causing a chain reaction of destabilization on the ankles, knees, hips and spine. Higher up from the foot itself, the most common complaint is knee pain. This could lead to knee arthritis if it is a chronic condition. A flattened foot that has been functioning as a suboptimal orientation for so many years will eventually cause one side of the knee joint to wear out. The problem may have been prevented by correcting the feet early on in life. Flat foot is actually an umbrella term for many conditions. For example, tarsal coalition, ankle equinas, unstable OS navicule, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, midfoot arthritis, hallux upfoot for valgus and so on. Each of these conditions should be carefully considered before designing the shoe insoles. Conservative treatment for flat foot is often customized insole. Podiatrists are specialists in integrating clinical diagnosis with orthotic design, creating a specific prescription each patient needs for their optimal control and correction of the flat foot. This is never as simple as just pushing up a low arch profile with an insole. Also, podiatrists design in millimeters, not centimeters. That means our orthotic corrections must be accurate to a person's foot biomechanics by less than a fraction of a millimeter. Pain from flat feet can be easily managed conservatively.",Flat Feet,4,4,4,2,1,3,1,5,2,2,2,5,1,3,2," 4

Explanation:

The transcript provides a balanced overview of flat feet, including its causes, potential consequences, and treatment options. It acknowledges that flat feet can occur during childhood (congenital) or adulthood (acquired), and highlights the importance of early intervention to prevent long-term complications. Additionally, the transcript mentions various conditions that fall under the umbrella term of ""flat feet,"" suggesting a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

However, the transcript leans towards promoting customized insoles as the primary treatment option, with a particular emphasis on the role of podiatrists in designing and prescribing these insoles. While this information is valuable, it lacks a balanced discussion of other potential treatment options, such as physical therapy, exercise, or surgical interventions in severe cases.

Furthermore, the transcript does not explicitly reference multiple research studies or expert opinions, relying primarily on the speaker's expertise and professional experience"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to flat feet.

However, the transcript does not suggest any further reading materials or mention other organizations that provide advice and information about flat feet."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for flat feet. It mentions that ""Each of these conditions should be carefully considered before designing the shoe insoles,"" implying that there are different treatment options depending on the specific underlying condition causing the flat foot. Additionally, it emphasizes that conservative treatment with customized insoles is ""never as simple as just pushing up a low arch profile with an insole,"" suggesting that there are nuances and considerations in the design and prescription of insoles. The transcript also highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and precise orthotic corrections, indicating that there is uncertainty and variability in the appropriate treatment approach based on individual biomechanics."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information on how certain treatments work, but it lacks details for most of the treatments mentioned. Specifically, it describes that customized insoles work by providing optimal control and correction of the flat foot condition, and that podiatrists design insoles with precise corrections based on the patient's foot biomechanics. However, it does not explain how other treatments like tarsal coalition, ankle equinas, unstable OS navicule, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, midfoot arthritis, and hallux upfoot valgus work to address flat feet.

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of treatment for flat feet. It mentions that customized insoles prescribed by podiatrists can provide ""optimal control and correction of the flat foot"" and that ""pain from flat feet can be easily managed conservatively."" However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of other potential treatments, such as physical therapy, bracing, or surgery. The focus is primarily on the use of custom orthotics as a treatment option."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks of treatments for flat feet. It mentions that leaving flat feet untreated can lead to long-term chronic pain, knee arthritis, and other issues in the ankles, knees, hips, and spine. However, it does not explicitly mention any risks or potential side effects associated with the conservative treatment of customized insoles prescribed by podiatrists. The transcript focuses more on explaining the causes and consequences of flat feet, as well as the importance of accurate customization for insole treatments, but it does not discuss the potential risks or complications of the insole treatment itself."," 5

Explanation: The transcript clearly describes the risks of leaving a flat foot condition without treatment. It mentions that ""Leaving a flat foot condition without treatment can lead to long-term chronic pain"" and that it can cause a ""chain reaction of destabilization on the ankles, knees, hips and spine."" The transcript also specifically states that ""Higher up from the foot itself, the most common complaint is knee pain. This could lead to knee arthritis if it is a chronic condition."" Therefore, the video provides a clear description of the risks associated with not treating flat feet, which warrants a score of 5."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any effects of the treatment choices (insoles/orthotics) on overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. It focuses on describing various causes of flat feet, potential consequences if left untreated, and the importance of customized insoles/orthotics designed by podiatrists. However, there is no reference to how the treatment options affect a person's ability to perform daily activities or their overall quality of life."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation:
The transcript mentions that flat feet can have various underlying causes, such as tarsal coalition, ankle equinas, unstable OS navicule, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, midfoot arthritis, and hallux upfoot for valgus. It also suggests that each of these conditions should be carefully considered before designing shoe insoles as the treatment approach. However, the transcript does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice mentioned (e.g., customized insoles) and under what circumstances. It also does not explicitly suggest alternatives to consider or investigate further before deciding on a particular treatment choice.

While the transcript acknowledges that flat feet can have multiple underlying causes, it primarily focuses on the use of customized insoles as the treatment approach without delving into the specifics of when this treatment choice would be most appropriate or when alternative treatments might be considered."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The transcript primarily focuses on explaining flat feet, their causes, potential consequences, and the importance of proper treatment with customized insoles. While it emphasizes the need for accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment by podiatrists, it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals. The video lacks direct encouragement for patients to engage in shared decision-making with their healthcare team or loved ones.

y6FYrADwUUs,"Flat feet affects a large percentage of the population throughout the world. Flat feet occurs because the tendons holding the joints of the foot together are loose. Dr. Aaron Bean of Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs explains this condition further and the treatments currently offered. 30 percent of adults and even kids have flat feet, the other 30 percent have a high arch foot and the rest of us have a normal type foot but probably about 30 percent of us have flat feet that may or may not hurt. There is a familiar component, we know that patients that come in even kids with a symptomatic painful flat foot, I'll always ask them, does your mom or dad have a flat foot and I'd say about 80 percent of the time they say, yea dad's got flat feet, they hurt too and we know its about time to bring him in. So definitely we think there is a genetic component. So a lot of times they get pain, the foot starts to collapse and the foot rolls in or we call pronates. So they get a lot of pain on the inside of the foot in the arch and in a severe flat foot, sometimes they'll pain on the outside of the foot or the ankle because the foot is actually collapsing and pinching the outside of the foot. Typically I start seeing kids around seven, eight years old and a lot of times these kids by the time they hit four or five years old they have a flat feet, most kids do and they grow out of it, they start to develop an arch but about seven, eight years old is when they start having pain in these feet and that's when we start seeing them come in the office and evaluate them and start a treatment program. So in the early stages especially with children, usually it's a flexible deformity. In rare cases you get an abnormal bone bridge or a congenital deformity that needs to be surgically corrected more immediately, but in most of the cases we start with a custom orthotics. So we take a mold of these children's feet- it's a match for their arch and then they wear this device that will support and lift up this flexible flat foot and a lot of times, it relaxes the tendons takes the pressure off the foot and in some instances can prevent having surgery down the road. So usually that's what we start with is a more custom molded device that fits into their shoe. Flat feet and plantar fasciitis, there definitely is a connection there. We find that patients when that arch collapses, they start to develop pain in that plantar fascia which is a ligament on the bottom of the foot. I'd say about 50 percent of my patients with a symptomatic flat foot also have plantar fasciitis. So again, we usually start with a custom molded orthotic to lift up the arch and support the foot. The arch of the foot it's not just a bony structure, there's tendons and ligaments that contribute to that, so we start with that custom orthotics and stretching and anti inflammatory and most patients get some relief with that treatment. If these patients don't respond to conservative treatment, then we have a surgical protocol that we follow that's tailored for the patient. We actually do a fair amount of flat foot surgery on patients and patients get a lot of relief. We find that with this flat foot surgery, we're preventing an arthritic foot that would have to be fused later on down the road so in patients that are in their forties and fifties, they are a good candidate for this reconstructive flat foot surgery that can prevent them from having arthritic problems that would be a more drastic motion limiting surgery down the road. We can actually restore a more normal arch and provide a foot that mechanically is more stable so that twenty, thirty years after these reconstructive flat foot surgeries the patients have a normal functioning foot and a lot of times we're finding that these adults that put off this flat foot surgery and just deal with the pain. They come to us when they're seventy, eighty years old and have a collapsed arthritic foot that can sometimes be difficult to reconstruct at that time.",Flat Feet,5,4,5,3,2,4,1,5,3,4,2,2,2,4,3," 5

Explanation:

The transcript provides a balanced overview of flat feet, covering various aspects such as its prevalence, causes, symptoms, and treatment options. The information is presented from an objective point of view, as it relies on expert medical opinion from Dr. Aaron Bean, a specialist in the field.

The transcript covers both conservative treatments like custom orthotics, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as surgical options for more severe cases. It also highlights the potential long-term consequences of untreated flat feet, such as arthritis and the need for more invasive surgeries later in life.

However, the transcript primarily focuses on the information and experience of a single medical expert, Dr. Aaron Bean. While his expertise is evident, the lack of references to other research studies or additional expert opinions slightly limits the balance and breadth of the information presented.

Overall, the transcript provides a comprehensive and objective overview of flat feet, covering various aspects"," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any additional sources of support or information related to flat feet. It is a monologue by a doctor explaining the causes, symptoms, and treatments for flat feet, but does not suggest further reading materials or mention other organizations that could provide advice or information on the topic."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for flat feet. The transcript mentions that in most cases, custom orthotics are used as the initial treatment, especially for children with flexible flat feet. However, it also states that in rare cases with congenital deformities or abnormal bone bridges, surgery may be needed more immediately. For adults who do not respond to conservative treatment with orthotics, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medication, the doctor mentions that they follow a surgical protocol tailored for the patient. The video acknowledges that there are different treatment approaches depending on the severity, age, and specific condition of the patient, indicating uncertainty in the optimal treatment choice for every case."," 3

The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments for flat feet work, but the explanations are somewhat limited or incomplete for other treatments mentioned.

For custom orthotics, it explains that they lift and support the arch, relaxing the tendons and taking pressure off the foot, potentially preventing surgery down the road. This gives a reasonable description of how orthotics work.

For stretching and anti-inflammatories for plantar fasciitis associated with flat feet, it just states that they are used along with orthotics, without details on their mechanisms.

For flat foot surgery, it mentions that it can restore a more normal arch and provide a mechanically more stable foot to prevent future arthritis, but doesn't really go into the specifics of how the surgery achieves this.

So while there are some explanations of treatment mechanisms, especially for orthotics, the details provided are incomplete or lacking for some of the other treatments mentioned. Therefore"," 4

The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments for flat feet. It mentions the following benefits:

1. Custom orthotics can support and lift up the flexible flat foot, relax the tendons, take pressure off the foot, and in some instances prevent the need for surgery down the road.

2. For plantar fasciitis associated with flat feet, custom orthotics, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medication can provide relief.

3. Reconstructive flat foot surgery can restore a more normal arch, provide a more mechanically stable foot, prevent arthritis and the need for more drastic surgery later in life, and allow for a normal functioning foot in the long term.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits of other potential treatments that may have been mentioned, such as non-surgical conservative treatments beyond orthotics and medication."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects/complications of the treatments mentioned for flat feet.

It mentions that in rare cases with children, there may be an ""abnormal bone bridge or a congenital deformity that needs to be surgically corrected more immediately,"" implying potential risks with surgery. However, it does not explicitly describe the risks or complications of that surgical treatment.

For non-surgical treatments like custom orthotics and stretching, the transcript does not mention any potential risks or side effects.

The transcript discusses surgical reconstruction for flat feet in adults, mentioning that it can ""prevent an arthritic foot that would have to be fused later on down the road"" and that delaying surgery can make it ""difficult to reconstruct"" the collapsed arthritic foot later. While this implies some potential complications of not treating flat feet surgically, it does not directly describe the risks or complications of the reconstructive flat foot surgery"," 2

The transcript partially describes what would happen if no treatment is used for flat feet. It mentions that if left untreated, flat feet can lead to plantar fasciitis and arthritis in the foot later in life, which would require more drastic surgery to fuse the foot and limit motion. However, the information is somewhat scattered and not presented in a clear, consolidated manner. There is no explicit discussion of the risks and benefits of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The focus is more on the available treatment options and why treatment is recommended to prevent future complications."," 2

The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life, but the information is somewhat limited.

It mentions that flat feet can cause pain, especially in the arch and on the inside or outside of the foot, and that this pain can be addressed through treatments like custom orthotics and surgery. It also notes that surgery can ""prevent an arthritic foot that would have to be fused later on down the road"" and ""restore a more normal arch and provide a foot that mechanically is more stable.""

However, the transcript does not go into much detail about how these treatments specifically impact day-to-day activities or overall quality of life beyond reducing pain and improving foot mechanics. There is no explicit discussion of how the treatments may affect mobility, ability to perform certain tasks, or other aspects of daily living.

So while it touches on the potential benefits of treatment in terms of pain relief and preventing future problems, it does not provide a comprehensive description of"," 4

The transcript partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for flat feet. It clearly outlines two main treatment options:

1. Conservative treatment with custom orthotics, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medication. This is presented as the initial treatment, especially for children with flexible flat feet.

2. Surgical reconstruction, which is mentioned as an option for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. The surgeon states that they ""do a fair amount of flat foot surgery on patients"" and that it can prevent arthritis and the need for more drastic surgery later in life.

However, the transcript does not provide a detailed description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice and under what specific circumstances one option may be preferred over the other. It mainly suggests that surgery is considered for those who do not respond to conservative treatment, but does not delve into factors that would guide that decision.

s2GoIydvP_Y,"This video is about the treatment of an acquired flat foot with the Shark Screw® diver transplant.The patient is a 60-year-old female on whose left foot we perform a calcaneal osteotomy and an FDL tendon transfer. With the patient lying on her left side, we make an incision 2 cm dorsal to the fibular point, which follows the course of the peroneal tendons. While sparing the peroneal tendons, the nervus suralis and the vena saphena parva, we incise the periosteum of the calcaneus at the level of the planned osteotomy. We use Hohmann hooks in the wound angles. Using the fluoro for guidance, we determine the osteotomy line. To ensure a planar osteotomy area, we perform an osteotomy with the oscillating saw through a cutting gauge. The osteotomy runs transversally from proximal dorsal to distal plantar at an angle of approximately 45°. Next, we mobilize the dorsal fragment with a wide chisel and move it medially by one centimeter. In the corrected position we insert a 1.6 mm thick wire from the tuber calcanei from the lateral plantar direction over the osteotomy into the anterior part of the calcaneus. After a check using the fluoro, we apply pressure to the osteotomy from the outside with large forceps. The branches of the forceps are inserted dorsally at the tuber calcanei and ventrally at the talus. Then we insert a second 1.6 mm K-wire into the transition of the plantar skin to the normal skin in the direction of the talar neck. Since the K-wire must not by any means get bent during the insertion, we use a 1.6 mm K-wire in the first place to later determine the exact position of the Shark Screw. After another check with the fluoro, we replace the 1.6 mm K-wire with a 1.2 mm K-wire, over which we then progressively drill the core hole so that the bone does not get hot. With the 5.5 mm drill we carefully enlarge the hole to the point where the end of the Shark Screw diver is supposed to be positioned later. In this case, we drill the channel 2 cm deep. That facilitates the Shark Screw diver to later slide over a bone canal to the beginning of the female thread. For a 5.0 mm Shark Screw diver, we cut the thread slowly with the black 5.0 mm thread cutter. The bone canal and female threads must be thoroughly rinsed to remove any bone debris. We then insert the Shark Screw diver using the fluoro for guidance to determine the exact position and bridging of the osteotomy gap within the calcaneus. The same procedure is followed to introduce the 2nd Shark Screw diver. We use two 5.0 mm Shark Screw divers for the calcaneal osteotomy. Finally, the smoothing of the lateral osteotomy border is performed. The patient will now be repositioned for the FDL transfer. We incise the skin along the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle behind the medial malleolus to the navicular bone. We open the tendon sheath. The tendon is resected to a 1 cm long distal stump. We expose the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle as far as the knot of Henry. In this spot, the tendon has mostly fused with the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. The tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle is severed just before the knot of Henry. If there is no connection between the tendons, as in this case, then the distal stump of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle must be sutured to that of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. We expose the navicular bone both dorsally and plantarly. We place a 1.2 mm K-wire from dorsal to plantar. After checking with the fluoro, we gradually drill up to size of the black drill and cut the female thread with the black tap, so that we can then insert a 5.0 mm Shark Screw for the tenodesis. Beforehand, we reinforce the flexor digitorum longus tendon and pull it through the hole in the navicular bone from plantar to dorsal with a threading wire. While pulling on the reinforced tendon, with light supination, and in a 20 degree equinus position, a 5.0 mm Shark Screw is threaded dorsally into the drill channel to firmly anchor the tendon in it. Since the calcaneo-navicular ligament and the medial capsule of the talonavicular joint are overstretched, we apply purse-string sutures. The proximal stump of the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle and the flexor digitorum longus muscle are sutured together in the area of the medial malleolus. This is followed by layered wound closure. The Shark Screw diver transplant is made of cortical bone and has excellent visibility on the postoperative x-ray. Due to the physiological bone metabolism, the graft is completely integrated and rebuilt. The respective postoperative care should always be assessed by the treating physician as it may vary from patient to patient. In this case, we apply a split lower leg cast in partial adduction and equinus position for 2 weeks. Following this, a closed lower leg plaster cast for another two weeks without weight-bearing, and for 2 weeks with weight-bearing, again in slight equinus position is applied. From the 7th week to the 12th week, normal street shoes can be worn with a supportive ankle brace.",Flat Feet,5,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,3,1," 5

WHGCRT9xgu0,"A cluster headache is not very common. It occurs in about .1% of the general population. It occurs more commonly in men, about a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio, male to female, which is different from migraine, which is much more common in women. A cluster headache, and the reason why it's called a cluster headache is because it occurs in clusters. Patients will have them, like Robert does, for several weeks or several months at a time, and then they'll disappear. They're gone for six months, a year, two years, I've seen ten years. But when they come on, that cluster period lasts a few weeks to a couple of months. They get headaches every day, typically two or three times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's an excruciating headache. It's described as the most severe head pain that we are aware of. It doesn't last that long. It's 30 to 90 minutes, although for somebody who's suffering from it, that's a long time. It's always and only on one side of the head, typically around the eye, frontal, temporal. And it's a constant, steady, sort of boring pain, as opposed to throbbing that occurs in migraine. And it's interesting with headaches. I feel like we can all empathize, because none of us maybe understand the excruciating pain. But I'm sure everyone at home who's ever had a headache is sitting here thinking, how does Robert come to work during these weeks on end when you're suffering with these? The cool news, because I want to turn this positive, is you feel now like you have a better understanding of these than maybe ever before. Yeah, it was really nice to talk to Dr. Kudrow, because I hadn't really had a conversation with my neurologist for a long time. I just, I was prescribed the oxygen. And it turned out when I was at his office that I was doing the oxygen treatment wrong for all these years. Now that I have a better way of doing the oxygen, it actually, when it does work, it works. So highlights two things here. Number one, when it comes to headaches, get the right diagnosis. Know what kind of headache you're dealing with. And number two, it's not just understanding the treatment that you're taking, but how to take that treatment. And before we go, Alan, you mentioned in the tape piece that it's hard for you to watch Robert suffer. So we're watching him suffer here at the show. You're watching him when he comes home. Knowing now that he's seen Dr. Kudrow and hopefully can get feeling better, what does that mean to you? It means the world to me. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to do anything to help. That's been the most challenging thing on my side is to watch him go through what he goes through and just have to walk out the door and go to work and go about my day while he's still sitting there in this state. It's just heartbreaking. Well, I think it highlights anytime you're suffering from any type of illness, whether it's a headache or anything, it affects not only your work, your friends, your loved ones, but sleeping upright. We saw that. And you're using all these pillows. It can get pretty uncomfortable. So we actually reached out to our friends at Sleep Number. They're providing you with the Sleep Number Flex-Fit 2 adjustable bed. Each side actually moves independently so one side can be flat and the other upright. So no more sleeping on the couch. Robert, get well soon. We'll be right back. .",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0," 4

0Fe0m0IF6r8,"Hi, I'm Dr. David Hill and today we're going to talk about natural cures for cluster headaches. Now cluster headaches are a particularly severe, nasty form of recurrent headache. A cluster headache is pretty much always felt on one side. Sometimes it feels like it's just an ice pick going right through your eye. It may be associated with neurologic symptoms such as tearing or even a facial droop and they tend to be intensely painful. We call them cluster headaches because they come in clusters. They're grouped together. You may have ten in one week and then none for a year after that. But when they're occurring, they can really be crippling. Now there are some medical therapies for cluster headaches but there's also one at least promising natural remedy that involves the extract of the cayenne pepper plant. This chemical is called capsaicin. Now all peppers have some degree of naturally occurring capsaicin. Some have very, very little of it. Some such as the habanero pepper have a whole, whole lot. Capsaicin is a naturally occurring irritant. That's why it gives you that hot burning sensation on your tongue when you eat it. It can also be used for pain relief by irritating the nerves that over lie the area of pain. That irritation sets up a competing response in the brain which stops paying attention to the original pain. Some people looked at this and thought, well, maybe we could use this for cluster headaches by squirting a capsaicin spray up into the nostril on the affected side of the head. And based on one relatively small trial, it does seem to be helpful. Now that said, in medicine, we like to see things repeated in multiple trials. We also like to see them put to a test for safety and efficacy in a large population. With the capsaicin spray, that hasn't happened yet. So I can't tell you that capsaicin spray is definitely very effective and definitely very safe. We just don't know that. But short of seeking medical therapy, it is one thing to try and if there's at least some indication that it may be helpful. So talking about natural therapies and remedies for the pain of cluster headaches, I'm Dr. David Hill.",Cluster Headache,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0," 5

The aims of the video are clear: it discusses natural cures, specifically the use of capsaicin (an extract from cayenne pepper), for treating cluster headaches. The video begins by explaining what cluster headaches are and their symptoms. It then introduces capsaicin as a potential natural remedy and describes how it works to alleviate pain. The doctor also acknowledges the limitations of the current research on capsaicin's effectiveness and safety for treating cluster headaches, but presents it as a possible option worth trying. Overall, the video clearly aims to inform viewers about a natural treatment option for cluster headaches and its potential benefits and drawbacks."," 4

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aim of providing information about natural cures for cluster headaches. It provides a detailed explanation of cluster headaches, their symptoms, and the potential use of capsaicin (an extract from cayenne pepper) as a natural remedy. However, the video also acknowledges that the efficacy and safety of capsaicin spray for cluster headaches have not been thoroughly studied or established through multiple trials.

However, no further reading materials, websites, organizations, or other resources are suggested for viewers to explore more information on the topic."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding the treatment choice of using capsaicin spray for cluster headaches. The narrator, Dr. David Hill, explicitly states that while a small trial has shown promising results, larger trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this treatment. He says, ""So I can't tell you that capsaicin spray is definitely very effective and definitely very safe. We just don't know that."" This statement directly acknowledges the gaps in knowledge and the need for further research before the treatment can be considered definitive. The video also mentions that medical therapies exist for cluster headaches, suggesting that there are multiple treatment options with potential uncertainties surrounding their relative effectiveness and risks."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the capsaicin treatment works in the body to achieve its effect. It mentions that capsaicin is an irritant that can cause a competing response in the brain, leading it to stop paying attention to the original pain. However, the description is brief and lacks detailed explanations of the underlying mechanisms or physiological processes involved. The transcript does not provide any information on how other potential natural treatments or medical therapies for cluster headaches might work. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, indicating that the description of how treatments work is partially covered but incomplete or unclear for some of the treatments mentioned."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the capsaicin nasal spray treatment for cluster headaches.

However, it does not explicitly state the specific benefits, such as reducing the frequency, intensity, or duration of the headaches. Additionally, it does not describe any benefits for other potential natural treatments or medical therapies mentioned. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as benefits are described for one treatment (capsaicin spray), but not for all treatments discussed in the transcript."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks of the capsaicin nasal spray treatment for cluster headaches. The speaker acknowledges that while a small trial suggests it may be helpful, larger trials are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy. However, no specific risks, side effects, or potential adverse reactions are mentioned for this treatment or any other therapies discussed. The lack of detailed risk information for the treatments covered earns a score of 2, indicating only partial disclosure of risks."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any information regarding the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for cluster headaches. The video focuses solely on discussing a potential natural remedy (capsaicin spray) for cluster headaches, but does not mention what would happen if no treatment is used. There is no reference to the potential consequences of postponing treatment, watchful waiting, or permanently forgoing treatment."," 1

The transcript does not provide any reference to the overall quality of life in relation to the treatment choices mentioned for cluster headaches. The video primarily focuses on explaining what cluster headaches are and briefly mentions a potential natural remedy involving capsaicin extract from cayenne pepper. However, it does not describe how this treatment choice or any other medical therapies mentioned affect the day-to-day activities or overall quality of life for patients suffering from cluster headaches. The information provided is limited to the potential effectiveness and safety concerns of the capsaicin spray remedy."," 4

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. While it primarily focuses on the potential use of capsaicin (an extract from cayenne pepper) as a natural remedy, it also mentions the existence of ""some medical therapies"" without providing further details. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who might benefit more from each treatment option or under what specific circumstances one approach might be preferable over the other. It also does not explicitly suggest investigating or considering other alternatives before deciding on a particular treatment. Overall, while the video acknowledges the possibility of multiple treatment choices, the information provided is somewhat limited and lacks clarity on the potential benefits and suitability of each option."," 2

Explanation: The video provides only limited support for shared decision-making. While the doctor mentions that capsaicin spray may be a potential natural remedy for cluster headaches, he does not explicitly suggest discussing this or other treatment options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals.

KtIeO9xn9G0,"Alright, today we're talking about headaches. Headaches are a huge issue in America. They can be caused by a couple different things. Stress for sure, but it could be chemical stress, it could be emotional stress, and it could be physical stress. Now headaches are the big reason why I got into the profession that I'm in now, which is chiropractic. I tried all kinds of different medications and treatments available to try and get rid of headaches and didn't have any success. Now there's a couple different types of headaches. There's just your normal tension headaches, there's migraine headaches, there's cluster headaches. I fell into the category of cluster headaches, which are the most severe you can think of. It's like a stabbing knife in your temple and they come in clusters. So you get one every 20-30 minutes and you get multiple headaches a day and it continues for multiple days. So it's really debilitating and doesn't let you live your life at all. And so when I was diagnosed with this issue, they gave me migraine medication, they gave me oxygen tanks, they gave me Vicodin, pretty much anything you can think of. And most of it didn't do anything for me. It helped maybe once or twice and then it just ceased to fix anything or help anything. So I went to the hospital most of the time when I had these headaches because it was the only way I could relieve them. And what they gave me was morphine shots. Now the problem with morphine shots is you only get a couple before they cut you off completely. And the reason they cut you off is because the stuff is so addictive that they can't give you too much of it. Now needless to say I used up all my shots really quickly within a couple months. And at that point I was like where do I go now? So I went to the massage therapist and the massage therapist massaged and it helped a lot. It relieved me my pain for a little while but always came back 10-15 minutes later. And the reason it always came back is because what I had going on was pressure on my nerves. Pressure gets put on my nerves by the bones and the tissue surrounding it. Now if you don't do anything to remove that pressure, like taking a drug or an Advil or getting massage done, that pressure is going to stay there and it's going to continue to come back as soon as the drug wears off or as soon as the beneficial effects from the massage wear off. So luckily I found a chiropractor and the chiropractor explained to me what was going on and then proceeded to adjust me. After my first adjustment I never had the headaches again. They were gone. Which is obviously why I'm doing what I'm doing today because it was such a life-changing experience for me. Now to say that everybody has those kinds of effects, it's not the truth. Because a lot of people take more than one adjustment. Some take three, some takes more than that. It just depends on where your body's at and what you've been through. It just so happened that I only needed one but the next person down the street might need more than that. But what I do know is that chiropractic can absolutely help headaches. Not just cluster headaches like I had which tend to be the most severe cases but the migraine headaches and then just the tension headaches that we get every day or that I see coming in my office every day from people at work looking down at their desk. I'd love to talk to anyone who wants more information on this topic, has questions about it and wants to know how chiropractic can help them. Comment below, subscribe to the channel and I'd love to hear from you guys.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0," 4

However, the transcript lacks some specific details about the aims mentioned. It doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of different types of headaches or delve into the scientific mechanisms behind how chiropractic adjustments can address headaches caused by nerve compression or misalignment. Additionally, while the speaker invites questions and comments, the transcript itself does not directly address potential concerns or misconceptions about chiropractic treatment for headaches.

Overall, the video seems to achieve its aims of introducing chiropractic as a potential solution for headaches and sharing a personal success story, but it could have been more comprehensive in its coverage of the topic."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript addresses the topic of headaches, their potential causes, and the speaker's personal experience with cluster headaches and how chiropractic treatment helped alleviate them. While it provides anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for headaches, it lacks scientific data or research to support the claims made. The information is partially relevant to readers seeking information on alternative treatments for headaches, but more comprehensive and evidence-based information may be needed for a complete understanding of the topic."," 2

The video transcript mentions some general sources of information, such as the speaker's personal experience with headaches and the treatments they tried. However, it does not provide specific references or citations for any research studies or expert opinions that may have been used to support the claims made about the causes and treatment of headaches, particularly through chiropractic care. While the speaker draws from their own expertise as a chiropractor, there is no explicit mention of other sources of evidence beyond their personal anecdotes. Therefore, I would rate the clarity of sources used as a partial score of 2, as the sources of evidence are not clearly delineated or referenced throughout the video."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information on the sources used, but specific dates are not given for most of them. The only clear date mentioned is that the video itself is current, based on the present tense used throughout. While the speaker references using past treatments like medications, oxygen tanks, massage therapy, and eventually finding relief through chiropractic care, no dates are provided for when these events occurred or what sources of information were consulted. The lack of clear dates for the majority of the referenced information results in a score of 2, indicating that the video is only partially clear when the information was produced."," 2

Explanation: The video presents a personal account of the speaker's experience with cluster headaches and how chiropractic treatment helped alleviate them. While the speaker acknowledges that different types of headaches exist and that individual responses to chiropractic treatment may vary, the video primarily focuses on promoting chiropractic as a solution for headaches without objectively exploring or weighing other treatment options. The lack of reference to scientific research or expert opinions beyond the speaker's personal experience also contributes to a somewhat unbalanced and biased perspective. Overall, while the video provides some useful information, its heavily anecdotal and promotional nature raises concerns about objectivity and balance."," 1

The transcript of the YouTube video does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the chiropractor's personal experience and recommendation for chiropractic treatment. While the video discusses various types of headaches and the chiropractor's journey to find relief, it does not suggest further reading materials, websites, or other organizations that could provide more information or advice on managing headaches. The video primarily focuses on promoting chiropractic care as a solution without offering alternative or complementary sources of information."," 3

The video partially refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for headaches. While the chiropractor does mention that chiropractic adjustments may not work for everyone after just one session and that some people may need more adjustments, there is no explicit discussion of the gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning the various treatment options mentioned, such as medications, oxygen therapy, massage therapy, and chiropractic care. The video primarily focuses on the chiropractor's personal experience and success with chiropractic treatment for cluster headaches, without providing a comprehensive overview of the uncertainties or debates surrounding different treatment modalities."," 2

The video provides a partial description of how some treatments work for headaches, but it lacks specific details on the mechanisms of action for most treatments mentioned.

The speaker briefly explains that chiropractic adjustments aim to relieve pressure on nerves caused by misaligned bones and surrounding tissues, which can contribute to headaches. However, the speaker does not provide details on how other treatments like medications (migraine medications, Vicodin, morphine), oxygen tanks, or massage work to alleviate headaches.

While the video mentions the speaker's personal experience with various treatments, it does not delve into the underlying physiological processes or mechanisms by which these treatments exert their effects. The focus is primarily on the speaker's journey and the efficacy of chiropractic care for their specific condition."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for headaches. It clearly states that chiropractic adjustments helped eliminate the speaker's severe cluster headaches after just one adjustment. However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of other treatments like medications (migraine medication, oxygen tanks, Vicodin, morphine shots), massage therapy, or over-the-counter drugs like Advil, beyond mentioning that they provided temporary relief or no relief at all for the speaker's condition. The video focuses more on the efficacy of chiropractic treatment for the speaker's specific case, but does not delve into the potential benefits of other treatments mentioned."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of some treatments for headaches. It mentions the addictive nature and limited availability of morphine shots as a risk. However, it does not explicitly describe any risks or side effects associated with other treatments mentioned, such as chiropractic adjustments, massage therapy, migraine medications, oxygen tanks, or Vicodin. The focus is primarily on the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for the speaker's own experience with cluster headaches, without detailing potential risks or complications of that treatment approach."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for headaches. The speaker shares his personal experience of trying various medications and treatments before finding relief through chiropractic care. However, he does not explicitly discuss what could happen if someone decides not to seek any treatment or opts for watchful waiting/monitoring without intervention. The focus is primarily on promoting chiropractic as an effective treatment approach based on the speaker's positive outcome."," 2

The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. While the speaker mentions that cluster headaches were ""really debilitating and doesn't let you live your life at all,"" and that chiropractic treatment helped resolve the headaches, there is no clear or detailed description of how the various treatment options (medication, oxygen, massage, chiropractic) impacted day-to-day activities or overall quality of life beyond relief from headache pain. The information provided about the effects on quality of life is limited and unclear."," 3

The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for headaches. While the chiropractor primarily discusses the benefits of chiropractic adjustments in relieving his own severe cluster headaches, he acknowledges that different individuals may require varying numbers of adjustments depending on their circumstances. He also mentions that he initially tried other treatments such as medications, oxygen therapy, and massage therapy, which provided temporary relief but did not fully resolve his condition.

However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of alternative treatment options or clearly outline the circumstances under which different treatments might be more suitable. The focus is largely on promoting chiropractic care as an effective solution, with limited discussion of other potential choices or guidance on how to evaluate them."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The speaker does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. However, the speaker does invite viewers to ask questions and comment, which could potentially lead to a discussion about treatment choices. Additionally, the speaker briefly mentions trying different medications and treatments before finding relief through chiropractic care, implying that exploring various options may be necessary. Overall, while the video does not directly advocate for shared decision-making, it leaves room for discussion and consideration of multiple treatment approaches.",set()
eftSLa_Li6M,"Cluster headache is the topic for this video. And cluster headache is one of the many types of headaches, but it's commonly tested on the licensing exams. And it most commonly occurs in men. It can occur in a very range of ages, but 20 to 40 is most common. And the symptoms, obviously from the name of the topic, it's obviously a headache, but it's in particular unilateral, one-sided. And it commonly occurs at night, so it awakens the person from sleep. And there's certain keywords that they tend to always use when describing this headache, and one of them is excruciating. So these are some of the keywords. If you really sort of get into the actual symptomatology, or symptoms, some of the key symptoms that they commonly describe are runny nose, rhinorrhea, teary, lachrymation, and pitosis, which is a drooping of the eyelid. And this headache can be pretty distressing and can occur again and again. And it can also be episodic in nature as well. The diagnosis, really, there's no diagnostic test. It's really just based on symptoms and history. Treatment. The most common treatment that they test on the licensing exams is you give the person 100% oxygen. That is actually the treatment for cluster headaches. There are two medications that are used as well. The first one is called ergotamine. And the second type of medication is known as atryptan. That's the class. And one of the most common is sumatryptan. So, that's the treatment. So, quickly recapping. Cluster headache. You've got a unilateral presentation. In terms of location, they describe it periorbital around the eye. Possibly even temporal region. In men, 20 to 40 years of age. Symptoms include drooping of the eyelid. You've got lachrymation. Runny nose, rhinorrhea. And you can also have these attacks in clusters, and hence the name. But what you really mean by that is sort of like this episodic nature where you have it for 1 to 3 months. And then it goes away, but then it comes back. And then the treatment includes oxygen, ergotamine, and the tryptan class of headache medicines. So, let's look at some clinical vignettes. 50 year old man presents with history of recurrent attacks of headache which manifest with peculiar rhythmic pattern. Each attack begins on awakening approximately at the same time. He reports severe unilateral plane located in the right eye and temple. Accompanied by runny nose, lachrymation, and sweating on the same side. The attack spontaneously resolves after 2 hours. Neither his siblings nor his parents had similar headaches. Temperatures 96, blood pressures 130 over 80, pulses 80. Pupils are equal and normally reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is most likely diagnosis? There's a lot of clues in here. You've got the fact that it awakens him. It's around the periorbital and temporal region. You've got the rhinorrhea, the lachrymation. So, all points to cluster headache. Next one. A 55 year old man comes to the physician because of severe daily severe periorbital right-sided headaches over the past 6 weeks. Pain often awakens him from sleep and is so excruciating that he wants to bang his head against the wall. He reports nasal stuffiness and nausea. He has had similar episodes on 2 previous occasions. Physical exam shows right-sided pitosis, lachrymation, and reddening of the right eye. Lab studies, hemoglobin 16, hematocrit 49, leukocyte count 6000, and ESR 5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Again, a lot of clues in there. They throw in this ESR because that's elevated in temporal arteritis. They talk about that because in temporal arteritis the ESR is elevated. So, just in case you're wondering why they put that in there. But this case is clearly describing a cluster headache. And one last one. A 43 year old man comes to the emergency department at 3 am because of constant severe headache for 1 hour. Pain is localized behind the left eye. He also had a watery discharge from the left nostril. He has had similar episodes nightly over the past week. He has had a history of similar symptoms over a 3 week period to 2 years ago. His left pupil is smaller than his right and the raspitosis on the left watery discharge is visible in the left naris. Most likely diagnosis is. Again, a lot of symptomatology pointing to cluster headache.",Cluster Headache,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0," 5

The video clearly outlines its aim of discussing cluster headaches, a specific type of headache disorder. The transcript provides a comprehensive overview of cluster headaches, including their symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, and clinical vignettes illustrating typical cases. The focus on cluster headaches is established from the beginning and maintained throughout the video, making its aims evident and well-defined."," 5

The video transcript achieves its aims of providing comprehensive information about cluster headaches. It covers the key aspects, including the definition, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical vignettes to illustrate the condition. The presenter methodically explains the characteristic features of cluster headaches, such as the unilateral, excruciating, periorbital pain, accompanying symptoms like lacrimation and rhinorrhea, and the episodic nature of attacks. The treatment options, including oxygen therapy, ergotamine, and triptans, are also discussed. The clinical vignettes reinforce the understanding by presenting realistic scenarios and prompting the viewer to apply the knowledge gained. Overall, the video fulfills its intended purpose of educating the audience about cluster headaches."," 5

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant and provides comprehensive information about cluster headaches. It covers the key aspects that readers might ask about, including the definition, symptoms, typical patient demographics, diagnosis, and treatment options for cluster headaches. The transcript also includes clinical vignettes or case scenarios that help reinforce the understanding of cluster headache symptoms and diagnosis. The detailed coverage of the topic and the inclusion of relevant case examples make this video highly relevant for anyone seeking information about cluster headaches."," 4

The video provides some references and sources of information to support the main claims and statements regarding cluster headaches, but not for all points made. The speaker mentions that certain details like the common age range, symptoms, and treatments are ""commonly tested on the licensing exams,"" suggesting these come from established medical knowledge and exam resources. Additionally, several clinical vignettes or case studies are presented, implying these examples come from real patient cases or medical literature, though no specific sources are cited. However, there is no explicit mention of research studies, expert opinions, or other direct sources backing up the information provided. Overall, while some level of authoritative medical sources seems to underlie the content, the video could have been strengthened by clearly referencing those sources throughout."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides no clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. It only mentions that cluster headaches are commonly tested on ""the licensing exams,"" without specifying which exams or when this information is from. While the video itself may be recent, there are no explicit dates given for the main sources or references that inform the content presented. Therefore, I can only partially confirm the clarity of when the information was produced, hence a score of 2."," 4

Explanation: The video provides a fairly balanced and objective overview of cluster headaches, covering the key symptoms, diagnostic approach, and treatment options. It references relevant medical terms and presents multiple clinical vignettes to illustrate the condition. However, there is a lack of explicit citation or discussion of specific research studies or expert sources beyond general descriptions. Additionally, the focus is solely on cluster headaches without comparing or contrasting it to other types of headaches or headache disorders. While informative overall, the narrow scope and absence of sourcing prevents a perfect 5/5 rating for complete balance and lack of bias."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to cluster headaches. The transcript solely focuses on explaining the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of cluster headaches, but it does not suggest further reading materials or mention other organizations that provide advice or information about this condition. The information provided is limited to the content covered in the video itself, without referencing any external sources or resources."," 5

The video clearly discusses the uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. While it mentions the most common treatments such as oxygen therapy, ergotamine, and triptans like sumatriptan, it does not present these as definitive or complete solutions. The video acknowledges that there is no diagnostic test for cluster headaches, and the diagnosis is based solely on symptoms and history. This implies that there is still uncertainty in the medical community regarding the underlying causes and optimal treatment approaches for this condition. The video focuses primarily on describing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria rather than providing a comprehensive discussion of treatment options, suggesting that there is still room for further research and exploration in this area."," 2

Explanation: The video provides a general overview of cluster headaches, including their symptoms, diagnosis, and common treatments like oxygen, ergotamine, and triptans. However, it does not delve into the details of how these treatments work or their mechanisms of action on the body to alleviate cluster headaches. While the treatments are mentioned, the video lacks an explanation of how they achieve their therapeutic effects. Therefore, the score of 2 is appropriate as the descriptions of the treatments are incomplete in terms of explaining their underlying mechanisms."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. It states that giving 100% oxygen is ""the treatment for cluster headaches,"" implying that it provides relief or controls symptoms. However, it does not explicitly mention any benefits of the medications ergotamine and sumatriptan (from the tryptan class). While these are listed as treatments, their specific benefits in managing cluster headaches are not described. Thus, a benefit is described for one treatment (oxygen) but not for the other two treatments (ergotamine and tryptans), resulting in a score of 3."," 2

The video describes some potential risks or side effects for the medication treatments ergotamine and triptans like sumatriptan, but does not explicitly mention risks for the oxygen therapy treatment.

For ergotamine, it does not directly state risks, but notes it is a ""medication"" implying it has potential side effects. For triptans like sumatriptan, it states these are a ""class of headache medicines"" again implying they are medications with potential side effects, though not specifying what those might be.

However, for the oxygen therapy treatment which it states is ""the most common treatment that they test on the licensing exams"", the video does not mention any potential risks, side effects, or adverse reactions.

So while it suggests medication treatments may have risks by calling them medicines, it does not describe any specific risks for those treatments, nor does it mention any risks at all for the oxygen treatment. Hence a partial score of 2 is warranted."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits associated with not treating cluster headaches or postponing treatment. The transcript focuses on describing the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for cluster headaches, but it does not mention what would happen if the condition is left untreated or if treatment is delayed. There is no discussion about the potential consequences or outcomes of forgoing or postponing treatment."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions the treatments for cluster headaches, including oxygen therapy, ergotamine, and triptans (sumatriptan). However, it does not provide any specific information on how these treatments impact day-to-day activities or overall quality of life for patients with cluster headaches. The transcript focuses primarily on describing the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for cluster headaches, but lacks details on the effects of the treatments on patients' daily functioning and well-being."," 4

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. It mentions that the most common treatment tested on licensing exams is 100% oxygen, and it also mentions two medications: ergotamine and triptans (such as sumatriptan). However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what circumstances one treatment may be preferred over another. It also does not suggest any alternatives to consider or investigate further before deciding on a particular treatment. While it acknowledges multiple treatment options, the information provided is somewhat limited in terms of guiding the selection of the most appropriate treatment for a given patient."," 5

The video provides very good support for shared decision-making regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. It extensively covers the symptoms, diagnosis, and various treatment options like oxygen therapy, ergotamine, and triptans like sumatriptan. The detailed explanation of the condition and available treatments allows patients to have an informed discussion with their doctors and make shared decisions about the most appropriate management plan. The video encourages patients to understand their condition thoroughly and be aware of the different treatment choices to collaborate effectively with healthcare professionals.",set()
7N8gzaATY2o,"During one particular bad attack there was a Black & Decker drill that was lying actually on the window sill and I really seriously thought about picking it up and drilling through my temple. It's like someone drilling through the top of my head and at the same time they're trying to shove a knitting needle through my ear and a nail through the back of my head. You've probably never heard of it but it's one of the most painful headaches you can get. Often confused with migraine, it's ten times more painful. Anyway I can ever describe it is when you have ice cream when you're a child and it hits the nerve above the eye, it's called ice pick headache. It's like that but it lasts up to three hours, a hundred times worse and you literally are suicidal. Cluster headache is often referred to as suicide headache and there's a publication in one of the headache journals that actually shows an x-ray of a cluster headache patient who literally stuck a shotgun in his eye and pulled the trigger and shot throughout his brain. Extraordinarily he actually managed to survive. The closest I ever came to suicide was one morning at 4.30 I was going to kill myself and I thought I've got a rope in the garage, I'll get the rope out of the garage and I'll throw it around the oak tree that was in the back garden and I went into the garage to get the rope and my son had used it to tie all his toys up so I couldn't even use the rope and I wasn't capable of actually undoing the rope. You're capable of absolutely nothing at all except screening. A thought expressed by every cluster headache sufferer at one time or another. All say that suicide can sometimes appear the only way to escape the pain. We can't get the oxygen, what are we supposed to do? The first time I had it I actually thought I was having a brain hemorrhage and I got some sort of brain tumour or something like that and this was it, this was the end and then it goes away and then it comes back in and it goes away and if something's wrong here but the actual attack, which it is an attack, it generally almost always focuses on one side of the head and the face, it can stretch down to the jaw, into the shoulder sometimes, it's absolutely excruciating. At the onset of cluster headache I was episodic where I'd go on average for about six weeks without anything in pain free remission and then I'd have a four week bout and then six weeks off, four weeks on. Eventually I turned chronic where I didn't get any breaks, the bouts just extended and became one bout. But more recently I went back to episodic again but you never know how it might just jump out at you and off you go again on the merry trip. My personal worst was the 15th of June 2005 where I actually had 15 attacks varying between 15 minutes and three hours and I was absolutely exhausted. Chronic sufferer Mike Pollock has lived with it since he was six and has had daily attacks for nearly 20 years. There's no cure and nobody knows what causes it. He needs daily injections and oxygen but says it's difficult to get the right treatment. Trying to get control is very important so we do have drugs like verapamil for example that we can use to try to reduce the frequency and the severity of the attacks as they actually occur but people are experiencing needing to take quite strong medicines to get the condition under control. I'm absolutely astounded by the way that people experiencing these severe headaches will just try and fight on through and battle on through and it really upsets me when people outside who don't understand what the headaches are like are just thinking that people are taking day off because they've got the day off just because they've got another headache. I don't think anyone would be able to understand what we have to enjoy, it would just be impossible so I tend to keep quiet about it. At the moment there's little or no hope for us as far as a cure is concerned.",Cluster Headache,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0," 3

N8zI12C937Y,"Hey everybody, this is Dr. Chris Kelch from Avondale Health Center in Avondale, Arizona. Today we're going to talk about another type of headache. This information is straight from WebMD. If you want more information, please go to this website. The type of headache in question we're going to talk about, thankfully you don't see very often, it's not very common, but they've been known to be so severe that they can actually cause people to commit suicide. They hurt that much. The headache in question is a headache called a cluster headache. So a cluster headache feels basically like an ice pick has been driven into your skull. Now what happens is, there's a bundle of nerves called your sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. It points to this bundle of nerves right here. What happens is this group of nerves gets overstimulated. When it gets overstimulated, you get severe pain in the head. Now it can mimic a migraine, it can mimic something called trigeminal neuralgia, so it's important to get the proper diagnosis. With this type of headache, it's important to probably get an MRI or a CT scan of the head too to make sure you don't have anything like a tumor going on. So once that's all ruled out, there's a way that we can treat that. There's something called an SPG nerve block. What an SPG nerve block is, is that it's a way that you can go in there and desensitize that bundle of nerves so that it's not as active. There's a very safe way to do it. I'm going to talk about that right now. So the used to go into here, remove part of your jaw and part of your face, and go in there and basically kill this part of your nerve. Well, that didn't work. So now, more recently, what they would do is put a Q-tip up each nostril, keep it there for 30 minutes, and hope that the medicine on the end of it would reach this bundle of nerves. Well, that doesn't work very well because a lot of times the medicine doesn't reach that bundle of nerves. And sometimes it's dangerous because it actually can puncture something called your cribriform plate, which can actually cause brain damage. So what happened was, a couple years ago, this genius gentleman that we met, this medical doctor developed a patented device that actually forms and fits very specifically into the nostril cavity here. And it sprays the medicine directly onto that bundle of nerves. So it allows you to use less medication than you would otherwise. It's more effective and it works awesome. Our patients who get this treatment for migraine headaches might not have headaches for up to six months if they follow our protocol. So it works very, very well. So what we're going to do here at the end of this video is I'm going to show you a demonstration of how this works, show you how easy it is, show you how safe it is. If you have any questions or want any more information on this procedure, if you have cluster headaches, feel free to look at the end of the video and go to our web page. On the web page, we have a free consultation coupon for you to come into our clinic. Basically if you come into our clinic, we help determine exactly what kind of headache you're having and then we can kind of go from there. So thanks for watching. So what we've got here is Avalon is getting the medicine ready. The medicine is just a local numbing agent helping to desensitize the nerve. So she's putting it in his nostril. She puts a little pressure on the plunger. The medicine goes in. She's done with that side already. He blows his nose. That gets the medicine moving more. She's getting the medicine ready for the other nostril. She go ahead and put that into the other nostril. That will numb that area as well. And boom, she's done.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0," 4

The video partially explains its aims, which seem to be providing information about cluster headaches and promoting a specific treatment method called the SPG nerve block. The transcript outlines what cluster headaches are, their severity, and how the SPG nerve block procedure works as a treatment option. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront and have to be inferred from the content. The video also appears to have a secondary promotional aim for the clinic offering this treatment, but this is not clearly delineated. Overall, while the main topic and some objectives are conveyed, a more explicit statement of the core aims would have made them clearer."," 4

The video provides a good overview of cluster headaches, their causes, and a specific treatment method called the SPG nerve block. It covers the background information on cluster headaches, explains why the new patented device is an improvement over previous treatment methods, and demonstrates how the treatment is administered. However, there are a few areas where more detail could have been provided, such as the specific medication used, potential side effects or risks, and any post-treatment instructions or follow-up care. Overall, the video achieves its aims of educating viewers about cluster headaches and the SPG nerve block treatment quite well, but some additional details would make the information more comprehensive."," 3

The video transcript provides some relevant information about cluster headaches, their symptoms, and a specific treatment procedure called SPG nerve block. It explains what cluster headaches are, how they differ from migraines, the need for proper diagnosis, and the rationale behind the SPG nerve block treatment.

However, the information is quite specific and focused mainly on promoting the SPG nerve block treatment offered at the doctor's clinic. It does not comprehensively address general questions that readers might have about cluster headaches, such as causes, risk factors, prevention strategies, and other treatment options. The video also contains promotional elements for the clinic's services.

While the information is partially relevant for understanding cluster headaches and one particular treatment method, it lacks a broader perspective and may not fully satisfy readers seeking more well-rounded knowledge about the condition."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially mentions sources of information used to compile the video content. It cites WebMD as a source for some of the information presented, and it also mentions that a ""genius gentleman"" or ""medical doctor"" developed the patented device discussed in the video. However, there are no specific references or citations provided for most of the claims or statements made in the video, such as the details about the causes and symptoms of cluster headaches, the ineffectiveness of previous treatment methods, or the effectiveness of the new treatment method. While some sources are mentioned, the majority of the information presented lacks clear references or citations to support the claims made."," 2

Explanation: The transcript mentions that the information is taken from WebMD, but it does not provide a date or year when this information was sourced. The only date mentioned is ""a couple years ago"" when referring to the development of a patented device for treating cluster headaches. While the video itself seems recent based on the production quality and the doctor's reference to the patented device being developed ""a couple years ago,"" there are no specific dates given for the sources of information used to compile the video content. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as only the approximate recency of the video itself can be inferred, but not the dates of the acknowledged sources."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript presents information on cluster headaches and a specific treatment option (SPG nerve block) from a personal and promotional perspective. While some general information about cluster headaches is provided from WebMD, the majority of the content focuses on promoting the patented device and treatment offered at the speaker's clinic. There is no mention of other treatment options or a balanced discussion of potential risks or drawbacks of the promoted treatment. The language used is also somewhat sensationalized and emotive, particularly in describing the severity of cluster headaches. Overall, the information lacks balance and objectivity, relying heavily on a single source (the speaker's clinic) and promoting a specific treatment without presenting alternative perspectives or research."," 2

Explanation: The video provides partial details of additional sources of information. It mentions WebMD as a source for more information and provides a link to the clinic's website, where viewers can find a free consultation coupon. However, no other external organizations or resources are mentioned for seeking further advice or information related to cluster headaches. The additional sources mentioned are limited to the clinic's own website and a general medical website (WebMD). Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that the video provides some additional sources, but they are incomplete or consist only of local branches of the same organization."," 1

The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for cluster headaches. It provides a detailed explanation of the treatment procedure using an SPG nerve block and presents it as an effective solution without discussing any potential limitations or differing expert opinions. The video seems to promote the advertised treatment method confidently without acknowledging uncertainties or alternative viewpoints."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how the SPG nerve block treatment works by desensitizing the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) nerve bundle to alleviate severe cluster headaches. It mentions the historical methods of accessing the SPG nerves and the new patented device that sprays medication directly onto the nerve bundle. However, the description lacks specifics on the mechanism of action of the numbing medication used in the treatment or how the desensitization of the SPG nerves relieves the headache pain. The transcript focuses more on the delivery method of the treatment rather than the underlying biological processes involved. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as the description of how this particular treatment works is somewhat incomplete."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. It highlights that the SPG nerve block treatment can desensitize the bundle of nerves responsible for the severe pain, potentially preventing headaches for up to six months if the protocol is followed. However, it does not explicitly mention the benefits of other treatments like MRI/CT scans or medication mentioned earlier in the video. The focus is primarily on explaining and demonstrating the SPG nerve block procedure."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks of the treatments for cluster headaches. It mentions the risks associated with older surgical techniques, such as removing part of the jaw and face, which could potentially damage nerves. It also warns about the risk of puncturing the cribriform plate and causing brain damage when using the cotton swab method. However, the video does not explicitly mention any risks or side effects associated with the new patented nasal spray device that it recommends. While it states that the device allows for using less medication and is more effective, it does not discuss any potential adverse reactions or complications from the spray itself. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as risks are described for some but not all of the treatments mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not include any mention of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment or watchful waiting for cluster headaches. The main focus of the video is describing a specific treatment approach (SPG nerve block) for cluster headaches. There is no discussion about what could happen if this treatment is postponed or forgone entirely. The video solely promotes the benefits of the described treatment method without considering the alternative of no treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choices (specifically the SPG nerve block procedure) affect overall quality of life. It mentions that patients who receive this treatment for migraine headaches ""might not have headaches for up to six months if they follow our protocol,"" which implies an improvement in quality of life by reducing or eliminating headaches for an extended period. However, the information provided is focused primarily on explaining the procedure itself and does not go into further detail about the specific impacts on day-to-day activities or overall quality of life beyond reducing headache frequency. Therefore, while there is a reference to potential quality of life improvements, the information provided is somewhat limited and unclear."," 3

Explanation: The video discusses one specific treatment option (the SPG nerve block) for cluster headaches in detail, suggesting it is an effective treatment. However, it does not provide a clear comparison or discussion of alternative treatment choices for cluster headaches. The only mention of alternatives is a brief statement that an MRI or CT scan may be needed to rule out other potential causes like a tumor. While this implies there could be different treatments depending on the underlying cause, the video does not explicitly describe who might benefit from different treatment options or under what circumstances alternatives should be considered. Overall, the information about treatment choices is somewhat limited and focused primarily on promoting the SPG nerve block procedure."," 2

The video provides some limited support for shared decision-making by suggesting that patients consult their doctor or visit the clinic to determine the appropriate treatment for their type of headache. However, it primarily focuses on promoting a specific treatment (the SPG nerve block) and does not actively encourage patients to discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers, family, or friends. The emphasis is more on the effectiveness of the advertised treatment rather than on shared decision-making regarding various treatment choices.",set()
YFKMB8LNeMc,"It's one of the most painful conditions known to humans, cluster headache, a pain so severe that female sufferers say it's worse than childbirth. The attacks can recur again and again over many months. Now the charity Ouch, which stands for Organization for the Understanding of Cluster Headache, is fighting to raise awareness of this incurable condition and to provide support for sufferers and their families. Music Cluster headache manifests with strikingly characteristic features. Each attack can last up to three hours if left untreated. The pain is so intense that most sufferers cannot sit still during an attack. Some sufferers have been known to commit suicide because they can no longer bear the pain. Around a quarter of a million people in the UK suffer from cluster headache. That's about four for every 1,000 of the population. It's estimated that cluster headache is 10 times more painful than migraine. Cluster headache is a recurrent form of headache with terrible disabling attacks of pain usually on one side of the head that are associated with particular features like eye watering and redness and usually with agitation in their behaviour. They come and they go, they blight a person when they're there and they disappear. Val Hobbs has up to four of these cluster headache attacks a day. The headache's cause is unknown and so far there are only two treatments that have proved to bring some relief to sufferers. A self-administered injection of a drug called Imigram. This treatment is relatively expensive and so GPs can be unwilling to prescribe it. Breathing oxygen at a high rate for 15 to 20 minutes has also been shown to provide effective pain relief. It just totally takes you over. There is nothing, there is just the pain. And I can understand why sadly some sufferers have taken their own lives because you just want to get rid of the pain. Unfortunately, cluster headache is a lifelong disorder and the charity Ouch! was set up to support the ongoing needs of sufferers. Their mission is clear. To get GPs and neurologists to understand the agony that we go through and the fact that we do not get the medication that we are promised by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. Ouch!, the Organisation for Understanding Cluster Headache, is just the most wonderful example of an expert patient group working within and outside the NHS to improve our understanding of the disease, to help promote the disease to doctors and within the NHS and to patients and to provide support for patients. They're crucial, they're unique and they're expert.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 4

The video aims to raise awareness about cluster headaches and the work of the charity Ouch (Organization for the Understanding of Cluster Headache) in supporting sufferers. It provides an overview of the condition, its symptoms, and the available treatments. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront but rather become clear as the video progresses.

BEKdACSjOJ4,"No review of migraine would be complete without the discussion of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a distinct, although rare, clinical entity that occurs in 0.4% of the population. Attacks of headache occur several times a day in clusters for several days or weeks at a time. The headaches are shorter than migraine, last from 15 to 30 minutes, and up to 2 to 3 hours. The pain is usually severe, knife-like, unilateral, and usually centered around the orbits or supraorbital area. Autonomic features such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, meiosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema are all part of the syndrome. Patients are then headache-free between clusters. Unlike migraine, cluster headache is predominantly a male disorder beginning between the ages of 20 and 50, with a male-to-female ratio of 4 to 1. Joe has cluster headaches, which occur every four months or so, and usually the headaches last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. A headache can last anywhere from minutes to hours. How long have you been having headaches? I've had cluster headaches diagnosed now for the last three years. How often do you get headaches? Cycles about every four months, and the cluster can last as long as 2 to 4 weeks. What age were you when the headaches first began? I started around about 44. I'm 47 now. Do you know when a headache is coming on? Do you have an aura? No, no precursors that would indicate I'm going to get a cluster headache. When the pain starts, that's the start of the cluster headache. When you get a headache and you're in a cluster, do you have many headaches during the day? One or two clusters in a 24-hour period, but they can come one after the other over a period of two weeks. Are there any aggravating or precipitating factors that you can see? None that I can put my finger on right now as to what will precipitate a cluster headache. When you get a headache, where's the pain located? It's a very sharp, stabbing pain in my eyeball and then the burning sensation around the orbit of the eye. It'll go back through the temple, into the back of my head, and then down my neck. What's the longest that the pain has lasted? For one cluster headache, I've performed medication headwind that lasted about eight hours long. On a scale of one to five, with five being the worst possible pain, how would you describe your pain? About a four. I would say a compound fracture would be a five. Do you have associated symptoms with these headaches? Yes, the side that the cluster headache is on, that sinus will have a very sharp burning sensation. That sinus will run. The eye on that side will tear, and sometimes I'll have that burning sensation go up into my scalp also. Do you have any members of the family with migraine headaches or cluster headaches? Yes, a brother, a sister, and my mother suffer from migraines, or have suffered from migraines in the past. Do any of them have cluster headaches? None have been diagnosed with cluster headaches so far. Have you ever had any diagnostic studies done? I've had an MRI for my neck and my head. Are they normal? They were read as normal, yes. What medications have you tried in the past? In the past, there have been a number of medications that I've tried. Prophylactic naprosyn, and metaprolol, and amitriptyline. And then to treat the pain, there was a Kefrigot, Migrenol, Stadol nasal spray, Furoset, Furoenol, a number of painkillers, Tylenol with codeine. What medication are you taking now? Sumatriptin, injectable, and then the Emerge tablet. And do these medications totally relieve your headache? They've been phenomenal is the word I would use. It has taken the cluster headache and knocked it down to where there's no pain. Now these headaches, are they disabling? Yes, I found that stabbing pain in my eye so intense that I couldn't work. I would have to leave my desk, walk away from the computer, try to find some quiet place, or go home. Leave for the rest of the day. And now? Now I can take a Sumatriptin injectable an hour later, take the Emerge, and by that time the cluster headache is done. It's finished. Joe represents a typical case of cluster headaches. He has tried multiple medications in the past. He now has 100% relief from Sumatriptin injections. Because cluster headaches are so brief, injectable Sumatriptin or nasal Sumatriptin are the only tryptons which work fast enough to give the patient relief of his headaches. How do you treat cluster headaches? One, oxygen is the standard recommended treatment with 100% oxygen administered at 7 to 10 liters per minute for approximately 15 minutes. Approximately 70% of patients will get some relief from their pain. Two, Subcutaneous Sumatriptin is an effective medication for acute symptoms. The medication may have to be repeated with a second dose. And finally, three, Prednisone given in large doses during an attack will help suppress headaches.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0," 4

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding the treatment choices for cluster headaches. While it discusses various treatment options such as oxygen therapy, sumatriptan injections, and prednisone, it does not definitively state a single best course of treatment. Instead, it presents multiple treatment choices and acknowledges that different approaches may work for different patients. Additionally, the patient's experience with trying multiple medications in the past before finding relief with sumatriptan injections highlights the trial-and-error process and the gaps in knowledge regarding the most effective treatment for individual cases."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information on how certain treatments work for cluster headaches, but the details are limited or unclear for most treatments mentioned. It explains that oxygen therapy provides relief by administering high-flow oxygen, and that sumatriptan works fast enough to alleviate the brief cluster headache attacks. However, it does not describe the mechanisms of action for medications like prednisone, amitriptyline, or other treatments mentioned. The information is incomplete regarding how each treatment acts on the body to achieve its therapeutic effect."," 3

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The transcript primarily focuses on describing cluster headaches, their symptoms, and treatment options. While it mentions the patient (Joe) discussing his experience with the doctor and trying different medications, there is no explicit suggestion or encouragement for the patient to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals. The discussion appears to be mainly between the patient and the doctor, without actively involving others in the decision-making process.

zXFXdiFsN8Q,"Cluster headache is one of the most debilitating of the primary headaches that we see and although it's one of the less common headaches affecting about 2 to 3% of the population, it is something that once you've seen you never ever forget and yet the average time to correct diagnosis of cluster headache is about 10 years. It's often incorrectly treated as migraine perhaps because one of its older names was migraineous neuralgia or incorrectly cluster migraine but it needs very specific treatment that's very different from migraine treatment. These are episodes that typically affect men in their 20s to 40s that will come as the name suggests as a cluster usually lasting about 6 to 8 weeks, sometimes about once a year, usually at the same time of year and they will experience excruciating headaches typically waking them from their sleep about a couple of hours after they go to bed that build up like that very very quickly and unlike migraine where people want to stay still and not move around, the agitation that accompanies cluster headache is absolutely extreme. They don't know where to put themselves and it's completely one-sided. One eye will be affected, it will go red, the one eye will run, the nose on the same side will run and it's literally focusing like a piercing hot poker in that one eye. After about two hours, it will fade away and disappear but then the same thing will happen the subsequent night or even up to eight attacks per day in some cases. Unfortunately, there's also a condition called chronic cluster headache where instead of bouts lasting six to eight weeks, it just occurs constantly with very little respite and that can be very very difficult to treat or to get under control and although we can provide treatments to help ease the symptoms, we've really very rarely do we manage to get somebody in complete freedom from symptoms during these episodes.",Cluster Headache,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about the aims, which seem to be educating the audience about cluster headaches, including their symptoms, frequency, and difficulty in treatment. However, the aims are not explicitly stated at the beginning or end of the transcript. The information about the aims is scattered throughout the content, making it somewhat unclear or incomplete.

The transcript provides a balanced overview of cluster headaches, including their symptoms, prevalence, and challenges in diagnosis and treatment. However, there are some indications of potential bias or lack of objectivity:

1. The language used to describe the condition, such as ""excruciating headaches"" and ""piercing hot poker,"" is quite emotive and sensational, which could be seen as alarmist.

2. The information seems to be primarily based on the speaker's personal experience and observations, rather than explicitly referencing multiple research studies or expert sources.

3. While the transcript acknowledges that treatments are available, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the various treatment options or their relative advantages and disadvantages.

Overall, while the information appears generally accurate and informative, the emotive language, lack of explicit source citations, and omission of detailed treatment information suggest a partially unbalanced or biased perspective."," 1

aHOuZYQa3bI,"What is a cluster headache? Cluster headache is a relatively rare, very severe form of headache. We call it a primary headache in that it's not due to something. And it occurs mostly in men. And it is a form of headache in which people have attacks anywhere from every other day to eight times a day, but generally short attacks one to three times per day. These attacks are just terrible. And they are incapacitating attacks. Generally the pain is around the eye, the forehead, the temple. Very, very, very severe. And people who get these attacks are very agitated. They do the opposite of what a migraine person does where they go to a dark, quiet room. No. Patients with cluster run around. They rock. They're incredible, incredibly agitated. And then they have a whole series of other features. They can feel full in the ear on the same side. They can have swelling of the face on the same side. They can get a droopy eye on the same side. Their eye turns red. The eye tears. The nose runs. The nose gets stuffy. And these are called cranial autonomic symptoms. And they are one of the hallmarks of cluster headache. And these attacks, which last generally about an hour, occur always on the same side and often, and this is very unusual, occur at exactly the same time of day every day. This is called circadian periodicity. And they sometimes will occur in the middle of the night and awaken somebody from sleep every single night with a severe headache, utterly disabling, complete with agitation, lasting an hour, two hours, three hours. These are really suicidal-level headaches. Migraine occurs in about 18 percent of women, six percent of men. Cluster occurs three to one, male to female. It occurs more often in men who are smokers. So middle-aged smoking men is the group that tends to get cluster, although it can occur in women. It's more unusual. And cluster comes in two varieties. It comes in one group called episodic cluster headache in which people will get these daily attacks for a month, two months, three months, and then they will stop. Just as mysteriously as they started, a person will have a long period with no attacks, six months, a year. And then they'll have another cycle of one to three months. That's called episodic cluster headache, and each cycle is called a cluster period or a cluster cycle. The attack is different than the cycle. The attack is the number of headaches that occur in a day during a cycle. The second form of cluster is chronic cluster. Chronic cluster patients never get a month off from cluster in a year. They're getting these attacks every day, every other day, multiple times a day, ongoing, year after year. I don't think we know the actual cause, but we know the anatomy. We know where it comes from. It comes from an area in the brain called the hypothalamus, and this area of the brain has a generator that turns on at the beginning of the cluster, and that generator is very close to the area in the hypothalamus where our circadian rhythms come from, our day-night cycling, our monthly cycling, our yearly cycling. All of those cycles come from the hypothalamus, and the generator in cluster turns on in the hypothalamus on the same side as the attack. And then we know the actual anatomy of how the nerves go from the hypothalamus down to the lower brain and out, and when they do go out, they go through a particular area called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or the SPG, which is kind of a target for some of the cluster treatments. But what's going on in cluster is very exciting. There are all sorts of aspects of cluster now that two, three years from now we may be treating completely differently than we are now. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? The way to think about treatment for cluster is that there are kind of groups of treatment. One kind of treatment is called transitional treatment, and that's where we give treatment to cluster patients to buy time so that we can put in preventive treatments. Transitional treatments involve generally steroids, oral steroids, or greater occipital nerve blocks using steroids as well as Novocain, and those will give patients relief for a week or two while we desperately and quickly try to put in our preventive treatment. What are the treatments for cluster treatment? Well, the most important aspect and most important advice I have is for every cluster patient to get a headache specialist to help treat, because for most cluster patients we can treat, not everybody. And some people don't tolerate Verapamil. Some people can't take Tryptans or Ergots because they have vascular disease. Shockingly and inexcusably, the federal government refuses to pay for oxygen for patients on Medicare and Medicaid who have cluster headache, and this is a violation of the standard of care. It's a violation of the guidelines of our professional organizations. We go to other countries and they cannot believe that our government does not provide cover oxygen for our most disabled patients. Many people think that cluster headache is the most painful headache, and it's the standard of care worldwide. The good news about this is, number one, most commercial insurances will pay for oxygen, and number two, we were able to publish an article this year that listed the cost of buying oxygen when the federal government won't pay, when somebody on Medicare or Medicaid needs oxygen who has cluster. And it's in most states, not Alaska, but in most states the oxygen is actually affordable, especially for patients with episodic cluster. So it's not the end of the world that Medicare won't pay for it, because very often cluster patients can afford to buy it because it's not terribly expensive. But the key is to get a provider who can diagnose it and who has a plan for how to treat. And without that, cluster patients are really, really in trouble. What is the future of cluster? The future of cluster is really exciting right now. It turns out that one of the chemicals that appears to be associated with causing migraine also appears to be associated with causing cluster headache, and that chemical is calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP. And a variety of companies have developed antibodies to either CGRP or the CGRP receptor, and these antibodies are being tested in what the government is allowing to be registration or pivotal trials. The rumor on the street is that the outcomes look really good, although none of the data are public, and I'm not part of those studies. I'm just passing on what I hear, but what I hear is great, and if these all prove to be safe and effective in cluster, the way they work is a patient could simply inject once a month or once a quarter one of these monoclonal antibodies and actually prevent cluster without a lot of side effects and without taking a daily medicine. So on the one hand, the monoclonal antibodies against CGRP look very promising and hopeful as designer medications to prevent cluster. On the other hand, there is a device that is about this big and is inserted through the mouth, and a good surgeon can get it in in under 15 minutes, and it has no external wires, and it's screwed into the skull, and then a remote controller is used, and this device sits over the sphenopalatine ganglion, the SPG, that key outflow point for cluster headache, and this device, this implantable SPG stimulator, has been already tested in Europe, approved in Europe for chronic cluster headache, and works in about two-thirds of patients in which the patient can either terminate a cluster attack or prevent cluster attacks or both. So there's never been a more hopeful time for cluster patients than right now, and the hope is that in three or four years our treatment will be vastly improved for cluster.

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant and provides comprehensive information about cluster headaches. It covers various aspects such as the definition, symptoms, causes, types (episodic and chronic), anatomy, treatments (including emerging treatments like CGRP monoclonal antibodies and SPG stimulators), and future prospects. The level of detail and the way it addresses potential questions that readers might have about cluster headaches make this video transcript highly relevant and informative."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some references to sources of information, but not consistently throughout. It mentions research studies and expert opinions in a few places, such as referencing the ""guidelines of our professional organizations"" regarding oxygen treatment, and mentioning ongoing clinical trials for new CGRP-targeting medications. However, many of the statements and claims about the causes, symptoms, and treatments of cluster headaches are not directly attributed to specific sources. The video seems to rely heavily on the expertise and knowledge of the speaker, without consistently citing external sources for the information presented.

The video clearly discusses areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for cluster headaches. Specifically, it mentions that there are ""all sorts of aspects of cluster now that two, three years from now we may be treating completely differently than we are now."" It also highlights that the future treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies against CGRP and implantable SPG stimulators, are promising but still in development or early stages of adoption. The video acknowledges that while these new treatments show potential, their effectiveness and safety are not yet fully established. Overall, the video provides a clear and explicit discussion of the uncertainties and potential changes in treatment approaches for cluster headaches in the near future."," 3

Explanation:
The video provides some details on how certain treatments for cluster headaches work, but the information is incomplete or unclear for other treatments mentioned. Specifically:

- It explains that steroids and greater occipital nerve blocks provide temporary relief to allow time for preventive treatments to take effect, but does not describe how they achieve this effect.

- It mentions that verapamil, triptans, and ergots are preventive treatments, but does not explain their mechanisms of action.

- It states that oxygen therapy is a standard treatment, but does not describe how it works to relieve cluster headaches.

- It provides some detail on how the monoclonal antibodies against CGRP are thought to prevent cluster headaches by blocking the activity of this peptide.

- It explains that the SPG stimulator device works by stimulating the sphenopalatine ganglion to terminate or prevent attacks, but does not go into further detail on the underlying mechanism.

Overall, while some treatments are described in terms of how they work, this information is lacking or unclear for several of the other treatments mentioned, warranting a partially complete score of 3."," 3

Explanation:
The video provides some information on the potential benefits of certain treatments for cluster headaches, but does not comprehensively describe the benefits for each treatment mentioned. 

It discusses the benefits of transitional treatments like steroids and nerve blocks in providing temporary relief while preventive treatments are started. It also mentions that oxygen therapy is considered the standard of care worldwide, implying it provides benefit, although the specific benefits are not described.

For potential future treatments, it states that monoclonal antibodies against CGRP look promising for preventing cluster headaches without side effects from daily medication. And it notes that an implantable SPG stimulator device has been effective in Europe for terminating or preventing attacks in about two-thirds of chronic cluster headache patients.

However, it does not clearly outline the benefits of some of the other treatments like verapamil, triptans, ergots that are mentioned. So while benefits are described for some treatments, they are not comprehensively covered for all treatments discussed, warranting a partial score of 3."," 2

The video provides some information about potential risks or side effects for certain cluster headache treatments, but does not comprehensively describe the risks for each treatment mentioned.

It notes that some patients may not tolerate certain medications like verapamil or triptans/ergots due to vascular disease. It also mentions that steroids are used as a transitional/short-term treatment while putting preventive treatments in place.

However, no specific risks or side effects are described for the other treatments like oxygen therapy, monoclonal antibodies against CGRP, or the implantable SPG stimulator device. The video focuses more on explaining how these treatments work rather than their potential downsides or adverse effects.

So while some treatment risks are partially covered, many of the mentioned therapies lack any discussion of their associated risks, resulting in a score of 2 for partially describing risks across the various treatments."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating cluster headaches or pursuing a ""watchful waiting"" approach. The focus of the video is on explaining what cluster headaches are, their symptoms, suspected causes, and potential future treatments like CGRP monoclonal antibodies and SPG stimulators. There is no mention of what could happen if cluster headaches are left untreated or if treatment is postponed or foregone permanently. The transcript lacks information relevant to the specified question about describing the consequences of no treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about how the treatment choices may affect quality of life for cluster headache patients, but the information is limited and not very clear or detailed. It mentions that cluster headaches are ""utterly disabling"" and ""suicidal-level headaches,"" implying that effective treatment would improve quality of life. It also notes that certain treatments like oxygen therapy and monoclonal antibodies against CGRP are promising and could potentially prevent or terminate cluster attacks, which would presumably improve daily functioning and quality of life. However, there is no explicit discussion of how the different treatment options specifically impact day-to-day activities or overall quality of life for patients. The information provided on this aspect is incomplete."," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. It mentions several treatment options, including transitional treatments like steroids and nerve blocks, preventive treatments like verapamil and triptans, oxygen therapy, and potential future treatments like monoclonal antibodies against CGRP and an implantable device for SPG stimulation. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one treatment may be preferred over another. The information about treatment choices is somewhat general and lacks specific guidance on how to choose between the options.

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting that cluster headache patients should consult with a headache specialist to help with diagnosis and treatment planning. It also mentions that patients should discuss treatment options like oxygen therapy with their providers, as insurance coverage can vary. However, the video does not go into extensive detail about the need to have open conversations weighing the pros and cons of different treatment approaches with doctors, family, and others involved in the patient's care. The focus is more on educating about cluster headaches and mentioning some emerging potential treatments rather than emphasizing the shared decision-making process itself.",set()
8SzLaz0Qk0s,"I'm Alexander Mauskob, director of the New York Headache Center. Cluster migraines. There are cluster headaches which are different from migraine headaches. Cluster headaches usually affect men. Fortunately, they're not as common as migraines. Only less than half a percent of the population suffers from clusters, while about 12 percent of the population suffers from migraines. More men than women suffer from cluster headaches. Excruciating pain. Some people call these headaches suicide headaches because the pain is so unbearable, even though it's very short. One or two hours, and the headache is gone. And patients know that. It comes and goes, but the pain is so intolerable, they're thinking about suicide, actually. So cluster headaches are occurring in clusters. That's where the name comes from. That is, you get one headache every single day for a month or two, and then the headache is gone for a year. And then next year, it comes back. There are some patients who have migraines and have cluster headaches, and sometimes we can't tell them apart. The difference between cluster and migraines is cluster is always on one side, in the eye. Tearing is a very common sign of a cluster headache. Nasal congestion, and people become agitated. Migraine patients would rather lie down and rest and not move. Cluster patients rock and walk around and scream, yell, bang their head against the wall. A very different picture. But again, there are some people in whom we can't tell the difference. It lasts longer than the typical cluster. It does not come in clusters, but it's pain in the eye and tearing, so we can't make up our mind. The good thing is that treatment often is similar. Same drugs can be effective for migraines and cluster headaches, and those include epilepsy drugs like Depakote, Topamax. Blood pressure drugs like Verapamil is my favorite. Steroid medication can abort the whole cluster. We use Botox injections for both, but migraines respond better. Imitrex, which is sumatriptan injections, is the only treatment approved for acute cluster headache. We use also oxygen for clusters, which doesn't work for migraines, but Imitrex works for both.

While it discusses various treatment options such as epilepsy drugs, blood pressure drugs, steroids, Botox injections, and Imitrex, it does not explicitly mention any gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning these treatment choices. However, the transcript does acknowledge that there are some cases where it is difficult to distinguish between cluster migraines and migraines, stating ""there are some people in whom we can't tell the difference."" This suggests an area of uncertainty in diagnosis, which may indirectly impact treatment choices. Additionally, the statement ""there are many, many options as to treatment of cluster headaches and migraines, and sometimes that overlaps both the condition overlaps and the treatment overlaps"" implies that there may be some uncertainty or variability in the appropriate treatment choices depending on the specific condition and individual patient."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about how certain treatments work for cluster headaches and migraines, but the details are generally lacking or incomplete. While it mentions that certain drugs like epilepsy drugs, blood pressure drugs, and steroids can be effective, it does not explain how these treatments specifically act on the body to achieve their effects. The only treatment for which some mechanism of action is mentioned is oxygen therapy for cluster headaches, but even this is not fully described. The transcript primarily focuses on listing the different treatment options available rather than delving into the details of how each treatment works."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches and migraines. While it does not explicitly state the benefits of each treatment, it implies that the treatments mentioned, such as epilepsy drugs like Depakote and Topamax, blood pressure drugs like Verapamil, steroid medication, Botox injections, Imitrex (sumatriptan) injections, and oxygen therapy, are effective in controlling or getting rid of the symptoms of cluster headaches and migraines. However, it does not provide specific details on the benefits or the extent to which each treatment is effective in managing these conditions, both in the short-term and long-term."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or side effects of the treatments mentioned. While it does not explicitly outline the risks for each treatment, it briefly mentions that steroid medication can ""abort the whole cluster,"" implying a potential risk or side effect of using steroids to treat cluster headaches. However, it does not provide any information about the risks or side effects associated with the other treatments, such as Depakote, Topamax, Verapamil, Botox injections, Imitrex (sumatriptan), or oxygen therapy. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as it only partially addresses the risks or side effects of the treatments discussed."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any information about the risks or benefits of not treating cluster headaches or migraines.

There is no mention of how these treatments impact a patient's ability to carry out daily activities or their overall well-being and quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches and migraines. The expert discusses various medications like Depakote, Topamax, Verapamil, steroids, Botox injections, Imitrex injections, and oxygen as potential treatments. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice and under what specific circumstances. The information on treatment alternatives is somewhat general and lacks specific guidance on selecting the appropriate treatment based on individual factors. While the video indicates that there are multiple treatment options, it falls short of providing comprehensive guidance on choosing the most suitable option for different scenarios."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The transcript mainly focuses on explaining the differences between cluster headaches and migraines, as well as discussing various treatment options for these conditions. While mentioning various treatment options implies that there are choices to be made, the video does not directly encourage shared decision-making or consulting with others regarding these choices.

ODw2eunhIts,"Guys, what's up this is Mobin. So the mini bean today is about the cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are the only chronic headache syndrome that is more common in men than women. Two-third of the men compared to women. The other thing is that it is usually Nocturnal. 50% of the men complain of this issue at night. It is a deep, excruciating, explosive, non-fluctuating, severe pain that occurs retroorbital and then spreads to one half of the cranium, hemikranium. The episodes occur about 8 to 10 weeks. So weeks to months in one year and then there is a gap for about a year and then it occurs again. Such episodes are called cluster headache and if the episodes occur after each other and there is no remission, there is no gap of that one year without treatment or the remission is lesser than a month without treatment, then that is called chronic cluster headache. The cluster headache seems to be because of the pacemaker neurons or because of the circadian rhythm neuron in the posterior hypothalamus and their dysfunction. Usually what happens is that with that dysfunction, parasympathetic system dysfunctions as well and that causes lacrimation and Rhenoria and stuffy nose and even Horner syndrome and pallor. But again on one side. Sympathetic effect may be present as well. A couple of important differences between the cluster headache and migraine are interesting. Number one, the patient of cluster headache usually they pace around, they move, they rub their head, they want the pain to go away, they are agitated, they are angry. On the other hand, the patient of a migraine tends to be motionless and quiet and at rest. The other difference is that migraine is usually associated with nausea and vomiting but there is no nausea and vomiting in cluster headaches. The most effective and rapid treatment for the acute attack is 100% oxygen therapy. One can give subcutaneous verapamil or nasal verapamil or other like endomethacin, other treatments but these are not as rapid and effective as 100% pure oxygen so that is a treatment of choice. In case of prophylaxis, as soon as the patient gets the first attack, what happens is patient should start on verapamil and that will be the prophylactic medicine. Again for prophylaxis as well there are more medicines for example ergods or endomethacin or NSAIDs however verapamil is usually started right away. For the chronic headache, cluster headache, lithium is used as a treatment. If you want to see more of these videos, please like and subscribe to this channel and also share it with your friends.

The video aims to provide information about cluster headaches, including their characteristics, causes, differences from migraines, and treatment options. However, the aims are not explicitly stated at the beginning or end of the video. The viewer has to infer the aims from the content itself.

The video covers various aspects of cluster headaches, such as their prevalence, symptoms, pathophysiology, distinguishing features from migraines, acute treatment with oxygen therapy, and prophylactic treatment with medications like verapamil and lithium. While the information is comprehensive, the lack of a clear introductory statement or summary of the aims makes the overall objectives slightly unclear."," 4

Explanation: The video provides a comprehensive overview of cluster headaches, including their defining characteristics, differences from migraines, and treatment options. It covers the key aims of describing the condition, its symptoms, potential causes, and management strategies. However, it lacks some specific details, such as diagnostic criteria or a more in-depth discussion of the pathophysiology. Overall, the video achieves its aims of providing essential information about cluster headaches, but with some minor gaps."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about cluster headaches, including their prevalence, symptoms, causes, and treatment options. It covers key aspects that readers might be interested in learning about cluster headaches. However, some additional details or clarifications could have made the information more comprehensive, such as explaining the specific pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, and potential complications. Overall, the information is partially relevant and addresses many of the common questions about cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript partially mentions some sources of information or evidence for the claims made regarding cluster headaches. While it discusses the characteristics, causes, and treatments for cluster headaches, it does not explicitly cite or reference any specific research studies or expert opinions to support these statements. The only potential source mentioned is a brief reference to the involvement of the ""pacemaker neurons or because of the circadian rhythm neuron in the posterior hypothalamus and their dysfunction."" However, no specific citation or reference is provided for this information. Overall, the video relies primarily on the presenter's own knowledge and explanation without clearly referencing the sources of evidence used to compile the information presented."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any specific dates or sources for the information presented in the video. The only date-related information given is the mention of the duration and frequency of cluster headache episodes (occurring for 8-10 weeks, followed by a gap of about a year). However, there are no clear dates or references provided for the medical information itself, such as when the studies or research on cluster headaches were conducted or published. Therefore, the score is 2, indicating that the video is only partially clear in terms of the dates of the main sources of information used."," 3

The video provides some balanced information about cluster headaches, including their symptoms, causes, and treatment options. However, it also exhibits certain biases and limitations.

Positive aspects:
- Mentions different treatment options, including oxygen therapy, verapamil, ergots, and NSAIDs.
- Compares and contrasts cluster headaches with migraines, providing a more comprehensive understanding.

Negative aspects:
- The information is presented from a personal point of view, using informal language and anecdotal evidence, rather than citing specific research studies or expert sources.
- The video focuses primarily on the advantages of certain treatments (e.g., oxygen therapy) without critically evaluating their limitations or potential side effects.
- Some claims, such as the hypothalamic cause of cluster headaches, are stated as facts without providing supporting evidence or acknowledging alternative theories.

Overall, while the video provides some useful information, it lacks a fully balanced and objective approach, relying heavily on the narrator's personal perspectives and experiences rather than a comprehensive review of scientific evidence from multiple sources."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about treatment options for cluster headaches, including the use of oxygen therapy, verapamil, and other medications like ergots, endometacin, and NSAIDs. However, it does not provide any specific details or references for additional sources of information or support beyond the treatments mentioned. The video solely focuses on the medical aspects of cluster headaches and their management, without suggesting any external resources or organizations for further guidance or support. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as the video lacks comprehensive details about additional sources of information related to the topic."," 3

Explanation: The video partially discusses areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. While it provides detailed information about the symptoms, causes, and some treatment options, it does not explicitly address gaps in knowledge or differing expert opinions on treatment choices. The only mention of uncertainty is the statement ""other treatments but these are not as rapid and effective as 100% pure oxygen so that is a treatment of choice."" This implies that there may be some uncertainty or debate around the effectiveness of alternative treatments compared to oxygen therapy. However, the video does not delve deeper into this uncertainty or discuss other areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices. Overall, the discussion of uncertainty is limited and incomplete."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details on how certain treatments work for cluster headaches, but the explanations are incomplete or unclear in several cases. Specifically, it mentions that 100% oxygen therapy is the most effective and rapid treatment for acute attacks, but does not explain how oxygen achieves this effect. It also states that verapamil is used for prophylaxis, but does not describe how verapamil prevents or reduces the frequency of cluster headache attacks. Similarly, it mentions that lithium is used for chronic cluster headaches, but does not explain how lithium works in this condition. While the video touches on the potential role of the hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system in the pathophysiology of cluster headaches, it does not connect these mechanisms to the treatments described. Overall, the explanations of how the treatments work are partial or missing, warranting a score of 2."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It states that 100% oxygen therapy is the ""most effective and rapid treatment for the acute attack,"" indicating that it provides relief from the acute symptoms. However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of other treatments mentioned, such as verapamil, ergots, endomethakin, NSAIDs, and lithium, except for stating that verapamil is used for prophylaxis (prevention) and lithium is used for chronic cluster headaches. The video does not provide details on how these treatments control or eliminate the condition, or their long-term benefits."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects of the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly discuss the risks or side effects of the various treatments, it does mention that oxygen therapy is the ""most effective and rapid treatment for the acute attack,"" implying that the other treatments like verapamil, ergots, and NSAIDs may not be as effective or rapid. However, it does not provide any specific information about the potential risks or side effects associated with these treatments. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as it only partially addresses the risks or potential downsides of some treatments but not others."," 2

Explanation: The transcript briefly mentions that if the cluster headache episodes occur without remission or if the remission period is less than a month ""without treatment"", then it is considered a chronic cluster headache. However, it does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment or postponing treatment for cluster headaches. The focus of the video is primarily on explaining the characteristics of cluster headaches and discussing treatment options, rather than detailing the consequences of foregoing treatment. While it implies that lack of treatment can lead to a chronic condition, it does not explicitly outline the specific risks or benefits of a no-treatment approach."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any information about the effects of the treatment choices on the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of patients with cluster headaches. The video primarily focuses on describing the characteristics of cluster headaches, their differences from migraines, and the treatment options available, such as oxygen therapy, verapamil, ergots, and lithium. However, there is no mention of how these treatments might impact the patient's ability to perform daily activities or their overall quality of life."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. It mentions several treatment options, such as 100% oxygen therapy, subcutaneous or nasal verapamil, indomethacin, and other unspecified treatments for acute attacks. For prophylaxis, it suggests verapamil as the first-line treatment but also mentions ergots, indomethacin, and NSAIDs as alternatives. For chronic cluster headaches, it recommends lithium as a treatment option. However, the video does not provide clear guidance on who might benefit more from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one treatment might be preferred over another. The information provided is somewhat incomplete in terms of comparing and contrasting the different treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The discussion focuses mainly on the medical aspects of cluster headaches, such as symptoms, causes, and treatments. While this information is valuable, there is no explicit suggestion for patients to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals. The only hint towards shared decision-making is the mention of different treatment options, such as verapamil, oxygen therapy, and lithium, which could prompt discussions about the most suitable choice. However, the video does not actively encourage such discussions or highlight the importance of involving others in the decision-making process.",set()
kQeRSX3g4-8,"Now recently we were asking you on our Facebook page about various ailments and things that you suffered on a regular basis and how often. And the biggest one that's come out is headaches and migraines. And one in particular, cluster headaches, which I have to say I'd never heard of. I've got Dr Chris with us this morning. Chloe Silverwood, Chris, says it's a serious and very debilitating condition with no cure it seems. Amy Matthews, the most painful thing known to man. Sophie Mills, hi Sophie, she said my husband has suffered with cluster headaches for five years. It's ruined our lives. He's lost so many precious days and birthdays without us and his beautiful children. So this, I've never heard of them. Yeah, I mean it's not common, in fact about one in a thousand. But we've had this response because cluster headaches are severe, excruciatingly painful headaches. Sometimes termed suicidal headaches. The headache is so intense patients will bash their head against the wall. Now let me just explain it. Cluster headaches, because they occur in clusters, you might get one, two, three, four attacks a day lasting 15, 30 minutes. But then they occur every day for weeks and even months. Then you go for months and have no headaches at all. Then they come back in a cluster. And I mean... Is that, do you know the cause why people get... Well, it's like migraine, you know, what is the cause? We know it's a disturbance of blood supply in the brain and a disturbance or imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain. But with the cluster headache it comes on suddenly. It's severe. It's usually one-sided and you get changes on that one side. Migraine or migraine might be like all of those things as well. Yeah, but the cluster is far more, far more severe. Yeah. And of course it's occurring, you know, three or four times a day every day for months and months. Now, with the cluster headache you get other signs. You can get a red eye, a watery eye, stuffy nose, blocked nose, flushing of one side of the face or sweating on one side of the face. So when a doctor hears the symptom, it's cluster headaches. Now, the problem with cluster headaches is that it may be treated by alcohol, can be triggered by excess heat. So if you're exercising in a hot atmosphere, you can bring them on. Even solvents, petrols, perfumes could trigger, but everybody's different. OK. So how do you treat it? Now, this is your paracetamol, your ibuprofen, they will not work at all, right? What you need to do, if these symptoms I'm describing sound like you, you go and see your GP because the GP can treat you with a drug, a group of drugs called tryptans. Now, tryptans came out years ago for migraine. Now, tryptans, you can self-inject straight into the thigh. You can have a nasal spray or sublingual tablets, so they're very fast acting and they can help. Now, the GP could prescribe that, but you may be passed on to a specialist clinic where you may be given oxygen and other drugs that can control it. Well, Chris, just to get you through some of the other ones which are less specialist, these are called primary headaches and one of which is a tension headache, self-explanatory. Well, yeah, you know, the commoner garden headache, you know, about 70% of headaches are the tension type headaches, can be caused by stress, can be caused by just everything around you, bad posture in your chair. But easily sorted. Well, of course, what do we do? We treat ourselves with paracetamol and ibuprofen and that usually does the trick. But a headache that's persisting despite that form of treatment needs to be checked out by you. So don't ignore a persistent headache every day and keeps going back. And migraine, you mentioned, you threw in there saying it could sometimes people with cluster headaches might think it's migraine. What's the difference? Well, migraine is very common. Eight million sufferers in the country. And with migraine, it's not just a headache. If you've not had migraine, oh, it's just a headache. Now, we've got Sarah Hardy here. She says, and Anna Lees Owens, migraines make me vomit and I get shakes. It's not a headache like other people think. You get nausea, dizziness, numbness, disturbed vision. Mine can go on for days. It's absolutely exhausting. She's describing some of the classic symptoms. And again, it's a severe pounding, throbbing headache usually affecting one side. About 80% of sufferers, 80, 90% get nausea, 20, 30% get vomiting and you dislike bright lights and loud noises. One of the factors is obviously recognizing the trigger. If you can actually self-diagnose and recognize and what brings this on, that's your halfway here. And you can do this. Just keep a diary. What was happening before I got those headaches? Everybody's heard about chocolate, cheese, and red wine. But there are so many other factors as well. But you'll very often identify it. Then you've got to try and remove it. If you do get migraine, the simple thing is to start with soluble aspirin or soluble paracetamol and an antiemetic, which stops you feeling sick and helps the drugs to work quicker or move on to more effective treatments. What about a hormone headache? We've been hearing about that as well. Hormone headaches. Yeah, well, especially in women because of the cycle through the month with oestrogens, et cetera. And of course, a lot of women get headaches premenstrual. It's part of the premenstrual syndrome. Headaches in the menopause, headaches on the pill. Interesting that migraine can be improved during pregnancy. Pretty drastic treatment for you. It's very drastic treatment. The changing levels of hormones have these powerful effects on the body. So for hormone headache, is it just a normal treatment? Let's say you're on the pill and you get the headaches when you're on the pill-free days. You can take the pill continuously for a few months, and that can help it. Sometimes adding oestrogen before or after a period can ease the hormone. And of course, for menopausal headaches, HRT would help. What about something my wife suffers from greatly? Selective headaches. Is this to prevent you doing something? Well, I know she developed someone that suits her. That's basically... Women's prerogative, I think. When I was a kid, I had a lot of headaches, and I realized it was through not drinking water. Oh, yeah, yeah. Dehydration, yeah. Oh, dehydration. If it's heart and you've not been drinking, yeah, your headache, your field of ting, that's something that could just be dehydrated. Caring football's also contributed. We'll put all the information on our website as well.",Cluster Headache,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0," 3

The video has some aims that are partially clear, but they are not explicitly stated upfront. The main aim seems to be to educate viewers about different types of headaches, their causes, symptoms, and treatments. This can be inferred from the detailed discussions on cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, hormone headaches, and other headache types. However, the aims are not directly stated at the beginning, and the flow of the video is conversational, making the specific aims somewhat unclear or incomplete. The video covers a broad range of headache-related topics but could benefit from a more focused and clearly stated objective."," 4

The video provides substantial information about different types of headaches, their causes, symptoms, and potential treatments. It covers cluster headaches in depth, highlighting their severity, triggers, and management options. It also touches on other common headache types like tension headaches, migraines, and hormone-related headaches, explaining their characteristics and suggesting ways to address them.

However, some additional details or nuances related to the specific aims outlined for the video may be missing. For example, it does not delve deeply into preventive strategies or comprehensive management plans for each headache type. Additionally, some rarer or more complex headache disorders may not have been addressed. Overall, while comprehensive, the video may not have exhaustively covered every aspect related to its stated aims."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about different types of headaches, including cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, and hormone headaches. It discusses the causes, symptoms, and potential treatments for these conditions. The information covers many aspects that readers might be interested in learning about headaches.

However, the video does not go into great depth on certain topics, such as the specific mechanisms behind the various types of headaches or detailed treatment options. Additionally, there are some tangential comments and asides that are not directly relevant to the core topic. Overall, the transcript is quite relevant and informative, but there are some areas where more comprehensive information could have been provided."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some references to expert opinions and general information about different types of headaches, their causes, and treatments. However, it does not explicitly cite specific research studies or provide detailed sources for most of the claims made. The expert (Dr. Chris) shares his knowledge and experience, but the sources of that information are not clearly stated. While some general references are made (e.g., mentioning that triptans were developed for migraines), the video lacks a clear attribution of sources for the majority of the information presented. Therefore, a partial score of 2 is appropriate, as the sources of evidence are somewhat clear but not extensively referenced."," 2

Explanation: The transcript mentions that triptans were developed ""years ago"" for treating migraines, but it does not provide a specific date for when they were introduced. No other dates are mentioned for the sources of information used in compiling the video. The only clear date is the video itself, which appears to be recent based on the present tense used throughout. Therefore, the score is 2 (Partially), since only the date of the video itself is evident, but no dates are given for the acknowledged sources of information."," 4

Explanation: The video provides a relatively balanced overview of different types of headaches, including cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, and hormone headaches. It covers potential causes, symptoms, and treatment options for each type. The information comes from a medical expert (Dr. Chris) and includes some personal anecdotes from viewers, suggesting a range of sources was used.

However, there are a few potential biases or imbalances:

1. The focus is heavily on cluster headaches initially, which are described in quite dramatic terms (""suicidal headaches,"" ""excruciatingly painful"").
2. There is limited discussion of alternative or complementary treatments beyond medications.
3. The personal anecdotes, while adding perspective, may introduce some anecdotal bias.

Overall, the video provides a fairly comprehensive and objective overview of common headache types from a medical standpoint, but with some sensationalism around cluster headaches and a pharmaceutical treatment bias. Hence, a score of 4 (Partially unbalanced/biased) is appropriate."," 1

The video does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to headaches or migraines. It focuses solely on explaining different types of headaches (cluster headaches, tension headaches, migraines, hormone headaches) and their potential causes and treatments. While it mentions seeking help from a GP or specialist clinic for severe cases like cluster headaches, it does not suggest any specific organizations, websites, or reading materials for further information on the topic."," 3

Explanation: The video partially discusses areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for different types of headaches. While it provides some information on potential treatments, such as triptans and oxygen therapy for cluster headaches, and mentions general treatments like pain relievers and hormonal therapies for other headache types, it does not go into detail about the uncertainties or differences in expert opinion surrounding these treatment choices. The discussion remains relatively general and does not explicitly delve into gaps in knowledge or areas of ongoing debate within the medical community. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, indicating that uncertainty is mentioned but the information provided is incomplete or unclear."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information on how certain treatments for headaches and migraines work, but the details are limited or unclear for most treatments mentioned.

It briefly explains that triptans, which are drugs used to treat cluster headaches, act fast by being self-injected, taken as a nasal spray, or sublingual tablets. However, it does not describe how triptans work on the body to relieve cluster headaches.

For migraine treatment, it mentions taking soluble aspirin or paracetamol with an antiemetic (anti-nausea medication) to help the drugs work faster, but does not explain the mechanisms of action.

The transcript also mentions hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help with menopausal headaches and continuously taking birth control pills may help with hormone headaches, but does not provide details on how these treatments work.

Overall, while some treatments are mentioned, the descriptions of how they work on the body to achieve their effects are generally lacking or incomplete, justifying a score of 2 (Partial)."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of some treatments for different types of headaches, but does not comprehensively cover the benefits for each treatment mentioned.

It provides some information on the potential benefits of triptans, oxygen therapy, and other drugs for treating cluster headaches, mentioning that they can help control or alleviate the intense pain associated with this condition. However, the benefits of other treatments, such as over-the-counter medications like paracetamol and ibuprofen for tension headaches, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for hormone-related headaches, are not explicitly stated.

The transcript mainly focuses on explaining the different types of headaches, their causes, and potential triggers, but does not go into detail about the specific benefits of each treatment option in terms of controlling symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition in the short or long term."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or side effects of some treatments for different types of headaches. It mentions that over-the-counter pain medications like paracetamol and ibuprofen may not work for cluster headaches, and that more specialized treatments like triptans, oxygen therapy, and other drugs prescribed by a specialist may be needed. However, it does not explicitly describe the potential risks or side effects of these specialized treatments. For other headache types like tension headaches and migraines, it only discusses general treatment approaches like pain medications, avoiding triggers, and hormone therapy, without delving into the risks. Overall, while it touches on treatment risks for cluster headaches to some extent, it lacks comprehensive coverage of risks for all the different headache types and treatments discussed."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with postponing treatment, watchful waiting, or permanently forgoing treatment for headaches or migraines. The discussion focuses primarily on explaining the different types of headaches (cluster headaches, tension headaches, migraines, hormone headaches) and their potential triggers, symptoms, and treatment options using medications. There is no mention of what could happen if these conditions are left untreated or if treatment is delayed or avoided."," 1

The transcript does not provide any clear reference to how the different treatment choices for headaches and migraines affect overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The discussion focuses primarily on describing the symptoms, causes, and medical treatments for various types of headaches, such as cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, and hormone headaches. While it mentions that conditions like cluster headaches can be debilitating and ruin lives, it does not explicitly explain how the treatments themselves impact quality of life or daily functioning. The information is limited to the medical aspects without addressing the broader impacts on overall well-being and ability to carry out normal activities."," 4

The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for different types of headaches. It provides some information on the potential treatment options for cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches, and hormone-related headaches. However, the information is not comprehensive or exhaustive.

For cluster headaches, the video mentions triptans, oxygen therapy, and other drugs that can be prescribed by specialists. For migraines, it suggests over-the-counter medications like aspirin, paracetamol, and antiemetics, as well as identifying triggers and avoiding them. For tension headaches, it recommends paracetamol and ibuprofen. For hormone-related headaches, it suggests continuous oral contraceptive use, adding estrogen, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal headaches.

While the video acknowledges that different types of headaches may require different treatments, it does not provide a thorough comparison of the potential benefits, risks, or appropriateness of each treatment option for specific individuals or circumstances. The information is somewhat fragmented and lacks a clear framework for evaluating and choosing between multiple treatment choices"," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting discussing cluster headaches, migraines, and other headache types with a doctor or GP to get proper diagnosis and treatment. It mentions that for cluster headaches, a GP can prescribe triptans or refer to a specialist clinic for additional treatments like oxygen therapy. For migraines, it recommends keeping a diary to identify triggers, trying over-the-counter medications, and discussing more effective treatments with a doctor. However, the video does not explicitly encourage discussing treatment options or preferences with family, friends, or health professionals in depth.

QNkU1VoDSF4,"With another type of headache called cluster headache, which is more common in men than women, these patients have absolutely horrible pain to the point where it's also called a suicide headache. The headache lasts 45 minutes to 3 hours max, whereas migraine goes 4 hours to 72, typically. But the cluster headache patients, even though it's a vascular headache, it starts from a different part of the brain, the hypothalamus, not the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which is the migraine generator. And these folk can't lie down. They walk. They cannot be comfortable anywhere. They will literally hit their heads against the wall to try to create pain that will have them shift their awareness of the pain away from the terrible pain of the cluster headache, which is described by, I'd say, 9 out of every 10 cluster patients I've ever seen as, quote, there's somebody inside my skull trying to push my eye out with a hot poker, end quote. And I say that, and what's fascinating to me is people that, to my knowledge, have never met themselves, met each other, have this same explanation, almost word for word with what I just said. So there's different types of headaches that have different ways of presenting, but the only commonality between tension-type headache and migraine is central sensitization after a while. And one last comment is that in migraine patients, when they develop central sensitization, we now know that they can also develop allodynia. Allodynia is severe pain from non-painful stimulation. And what's so fascinating in the migraine patient is migraine is a brain disease, okay? And you might have pain, and that's why it hurts to comb your hair when you have a migraine. That's the allodynia, but some people have what's called extra-cephalgic allodynia, or pain, in their back or their hands. So even though this is a brain disorder that's associated with a headache, they will get pain in their hands. And last comment is there's a percentage of patients, anywhere from 7 to 30 percent of patients, with migraine, that do not respond to atriptan, which is like a bullet. It hits the 5-HT, the serotonergic 1, B, D, and F subreceptors. And once a patient develops allodynia, atriptan will not work, and we weren't cognizant of that relationship until the last couple of years. Yes, there is. You'd use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory first, wait an hour, and then in not all, but a good percent of the patients, atriptan can be used and be successful to stop the headache or at least bring down the pain level significantly. That's pretty new information, new being the last five years. And what's so fascinating about migraine, migraine was written about for hundreds of years, and we're still learning even basic facts. I mean, we all knew that during migraine it hurt to run your hand through your hair or to comb your hair, but now we know that it's truly allodynia, which can only come from central sensitization.",Cluster Headache,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 3

The transcript provides some information about the aims of the video, which seem to be explaining different types of headaches, particularly migraines and cluster headaches, and their symptoms and mechanisms. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, and the information is presented in a somewhat disorganized manner, making it challenging to grasp the overall objectives clearly. The transcript delves into specific details about headache types, symptoms, and treatments without explicitly outlining the intended scope or purpose of the video. While the content is informative, the lack of a clear introduction or stated aims reduces the clarity of the video's objectives."," 3

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information about different types of headaches and their characteristics. It covers details about cluster headaches, migraines, and allodynia associated with migraines. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all types of headaches or delve deeply into their causes, treatments, or preventive measures. The information provided is somewhat scattered and could have been organized more coherently to better outline the aims of the video. While informative, the transcript lacks a clear structure or conclusion that ties the various points together."," 3

The transcript provides some relevant information about different types of headaches, specifically cluster headaches and migraines. It explains the characteristics, symptoms, and underlying mechanisms of these headache types. However, the information is quite technical and may not directly address common questions that general readers might have about headaches. The transcript delves into intricate details about brain regions, neurotransmitters, and treatment options, which could be challenging for a non-medical audience to follow. While the information is factually accurate and insightful from a medical perspective, it may not be fully relevant or easily understandable for readers seeking general knowledge about headache types and management."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript mentions some sources of information to support the claims made, but these references are not consistently provided for all the main statements or facts presented. For instance, the author cites their own experience with cluster headache patients (""9 out of every 10 cluster patients I've ever seen"") and mentions that patients describe the pain in a similar way (""there's somebody inside my skull trying to push my eye out with a hot poker""). However, for other claims, such as the information about allodynia, central sensitization, and the effectiveness of triptans, no specific sources are referenced. The transcript also includes some general statements like ""we now know that..."" without attributing the source of that knowledge. While some sources are mentioned, the overall lack of consistent referencing for the various claims made in the video means it only partially meets the criteria for clear sourcing of evidence."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear dates for the sources of information used in compiling the video. The only date mentioned is ""the last couple of years"" and ""the last five years,"" which likely refers to when certain information about migraines and their treatment became known. However, there are no specific dates or references to the sources of this information. Therefore, while the date of the video itself may be inferred from these time references, the dates of the main sources used are not clearly stated, resulting in a score of 2 (Partially)."," 3

Explanation: The transcript seems to provide a detailed and informative explanation of different types of headaches, particularly cluster headaches and migraines, from a medical perspective. The speaker appears to be an expert in the field and cites some research findings. However, the information is presented primarily from a personal point of view, with the speaker frequently using phrases like ""I'd say,"" ""to my knowledge,"" and ""what's so fascinating to me."" Additionally, while the speaker mentions some treatments like triptans and NSAIDs, there is no comprehensive discussion of the various treatment options available for these conditions. The focus is mainly on the descriptions and mechanisms of the different types of headaches. Therefore, while the information is generally factual and expert-based, it lacks a fully balanced and objective presentation, leaning more towards a personal account."," 1

The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the speaker's own expertise. The video appears to be focused solely on explaining different types of headaches, their symptoms, and some medical insights about them. There are no suggestions for further reading or references to other organizations that could provide more information on the topic of headaches."," 4

The transcript partially refers to areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for migraines and cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly discuss uncertainties in treatment choices, it mentions some recent findings and advancements in understanding migraine pathophysiology and treatment responses. 

For instance, it states that the recent discovery that allodynia can develop in migraine patients due to central sensitization, and this can impact the effectiveness of triptans (a common migraine treatment). It also notes that the understanding of migraine, despite being studied for centuries, is still evolving with new information emerging in the last few years.

However, the transcript does not go into detail about specific uncertainties or differences in expert opinion regarding various treatment options or guidelines. It primarily focuses on describing the clinical presentations and some pathophysiological aspects of different headache types."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments work, but not for all treatments mentioned. For cluster headaches, no specific treatment or its mechanism of action is described. For migraines, the mechanism of action is briefly mentioned for triptans (they act on serotonin receptors) and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). However, there is no explanation of how these treatments achieve their effect by modulating the underlying pathways or mechanisms involved in migraines. The mention of central sensitization and allodynia provides some insight into migraine pathophysiology, but does not directly relate to how the treatments work. Overall, the transcript partially describes how some migraine treatments work, but lacks comprehensive details on the mechanisms of action for all treatments mentioned."," 2

The transcript does not directly describe the benefits of different treatments for headaches or migraines. It primarily focuses on explaining the characteristics and mechanisms of different types of headaches, such as cluster headaches, migraines, and tension-type headaches. 

The only mention of treatments is a brief reference to using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans (like atriptan) for migraines. However, it does not explicitly state the benefits of these treatments, only that triptans may not work once allodynia (severe pain from non-painful stimuli) has developed.

Since the transcript discusses some treatments but does not clearly describe their benefits, it partially addresses the question, warranting a score of 2."," 2

The transcript mentions some potential side effects or complications related to migraine treatment, but does not comprehensively cover the risks associated with each treatment option discussed.

Specifically, it notes that for migraines that have progressed to central sensitization, triptans (a common migraine medication) may not be effective. It also suggests using an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) first before trying a triptan, implying there could be risks or limitations with triptans.

However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the potential side effects, complications or adverse reactions for NSAIDs, triptans, or any other specific migraine treatments. The information provided is limited in scope regarding treatment risks."," 1

The transcript does not provide any information about the risks or benefits of not receiving treatment for the described headache conditions (migraines and cluster headaches). The entire transcript focuses on describing the symptoms, causes, and current treatment options for these headache types.

The transcript lacks any reference to the potential consequences or outcomes of a ""no treatment"" approach."," 1

The transcript does not provide any information about how the treatment choices for different types of headaches affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of patients. The transcript focuses on describing the characteristics, symptoms, and potential causes of different types of headaches, such as migraines and cluster headaches. While it mentions some treatment options like triptans and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it does not discuss how these treatments impact the patients' quality of life or their ability to perform daily activities. The transcript is primarily focused on the medical aspects of headaches and does not address the broader effects of treatment choices on the patients' overall well-being."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for different types of headaches, such as migraines and cluster headaches. However, it does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice mentioned or under what specific circumstances. The transcript mentions some treatment options like triptans and NSAIDs, but it does not explicitly outline the criteria for choosing one treatment over another. The information provided is somewhat unclear or incomplete regarding the selection process for different treatment choices based on individual patient characteristics or circumstances."," 2

The transcript provides some limited support for shared decision-making. It does not directly suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or health professionals. However, it mentions new information and developments in understanding migraine and headache types, implying that patients could discuss these with their doctors to explore appropriate treatment options. The mention of trying different medications (NSAIDs followed by triptans) for certain migraine cases also indirectly suggests the need for shared decision-making between patients and doctors. Overall, while the focus is more on explaining the medical condition, there are some indirect references that could support shared decision-making regarding treatments.",set()
5phVskfFUhU,"What are cluster headaches? Cluster headaches are a different type of primary headache disorder. They belong in a family of headaches called trigeminal autonomic cephalogies. They can sometimes have symptoms similar to migraines such as nausea, but they are different types of headaches. Cluster headaches are strictly one-sided headaches, typically around the eye, and these are very severe excruciating headaches lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours. Typically patients with cluster headache have what we call unilateral ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. This can be symptoms such as tearing of the eye, redness of the eye, swelling of the eyelid, runny nose or stuffy nose on the side of the headache.",Cluster Headache,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0," 4

WYP8ZFlDFDQ,"We've covered a lot of personal stories during the last eight seasons here on The Doctors, but this one hit close to home. Our staff was very concerned when it was revealed that one of our very own was struggling with an illness. Three, two, one, make your move. If you're in television, you should have as much fun as you can. Who's ready for some fun? Are you ready? And that's how I work. I am always trying to joke and have a good time. And I can't remember the last time I did that, these last two months. My name is Robert and I am the prop master for The Doctors. I shop and produce all the props that are used on the show. For the last eight years, I have suffered with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches can last anywhere from a minute to most of the day. They are extremely, extremely painful. It is unbelievable how debilitating these headaches are. I have seen him go from normal to curling up in a ball. It's so unpredictable. Almost every night, I have two or three cluster headaches. He will sleep on the couch. He has to prop himself up and then get up in the morning and sometimes finding him still in that same position. It's heartbreaking. In the mornings, I am completely exhausted. I have driven with these. I don't even know how I got through some of the days of work. It has been about a month and a half since I've had a full night's sleep. I have been to doctors, I've been to neurologists, and nothing really has helped. I do oxygen treatment now. It's the only thing to even make them bearable. I work with an amazing group of people. We are like a family. I'm blessed to be on a show called The Doctors. What's tough is that your workmates want to make you feel better. Having to stop and explain why I have an oxygen tank is really a rough part of that. Well, we're blessed to have Robert on our staff. And when we saw you struggling, we wanted to help. We actually sent Robert to see Dr. David Kudrow, director of the California Medical Clinic for headaches. Robert came in today with frequent, severe headaches. How long do they last? I had one this morning that was 15 minutes. About an hour after that, I had one that lasted four hours. Four hours. They have been two to three times a day. How long did the previous bout last? Three months. Always hit me in November. Sure. And always leave me somewhere in either January, February. Prior to that, were you headache-free? For three years. Before that was oxygen treatment as well. Are you taking any medications? We tried Imitrex. I was put on a steroid. Where do you feel it? It's been here. So you're pointing to your left side. Location is very important. I generally categorize headaches as either severe, which I call a number three headache, a moderately severe headache, I call that a number two, and I call a dull headache a number one headache, which does not typically interfere with ability to function. There's two different pains that I feel. A real intense throbbing. The other one is just a complete pain and tightness. And it's a pretty intense pain. Yeah. Robert's headaches were defined typically as number three headaches, or the most severe types. After seeing Robert in consultation, I'm pretty convinced that he does have, in fact, episodic cluster headache. This is a bizarre disorder. This is a truly bizarre disorder. Why every three years? In our audience is Dr. Kudrow. Obviously, Robert joins us as well. I almost always go directly to our guests, but Robert, because you understand this now, I do wanna go first to Dr. Kudrow, because a lot of our viewers don't know what cluster headaches are, and then what does that even mean relative to when we talk about tension headaches and migraine headaches.",Cluster Headache,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0," 3

However, it primarily focuses on Robert's personal experience with cluster headaches, including emotional accounts from him and his coworkers. While personal stories can be informative, the lack of references to other sources of information or treatment options beyond Robert's case suggests a partially biased perspective. The video does not appear to comprehensively cover cluster headaches from an objective, well-rounded viewpoint based on multiple expert sources and research studies. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, indicating that some aspects of the information are unbalanced or biased."," 1

The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the doctor (Dr. David Kudrow) who examined and diagnosed the patient (Robert) with cluster headaches. There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information about cluster headaches or headache disorders in general. The transcript focuses solely on Robert's personal experience with cluster headaches and his consultation with Dr. Kudrow."," 2

The video transcript partially discusses areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. While it provides some information about the patient's previous treatments, such as oxygen therapy, Imitrex, and steroids, it does not go into detail about the effectiveness or uncertainties surrounding these treatments. The doctor mentions that cluster headaches are a ""bizarre disorder,"" suggesting there may be gaps in knowledge about their causes and optimal treatment approaches. However, the transcript does not explicitly delve into differences in expert opinion or uncertainties regarding the various treatment options available for managing cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some details on how certain treatments like oxygen therapy and medications (Imitrex, steroids) work to alleviate cluster headaches, but it does not go into depth about the mechanisms by which these treatments act on the body.

2xLTTU5iLZQ,"My name is Brighton Roper. I'm a licensed acupuncturist. Today we are in my office in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I'm going to be talking about the treatment of cluster headaches with acupuncture. Cluster headaches tend to occur in a cyclical pattern or cluster, and that's why they're given that name. And unfortunately for the patients who get this type of headache, the clusters can last for weeks at a time, and the patient can even have more than one bout of cluster headaches a year. Some characteristics of cluster headaches are that they can come on suddenly, affect one side of the face, and they can even cause eye pain or eye redness. In terms of Chinese medicine, three of the patterns that most closely fit with cluster headaches would be liver yang rising, liver fire rising, or blood stasis. So some of the points that would be commonly used to treat a cluster headache are actually at distal parts of the body, such as the foot. Liver two is a point on the liver channel that clears liver heat and fire and keeps it from rising. Kidney three. Large intestine four is actually the command point of the face, and it will help direct the treatment to the head and face where the headache is. San jiao five. Good for alleviating pain. And some points in the local area. Gallbladder eight, and tai yang, which is an extra point. Again, this is brightened roper, and we've just talked about treating cluster headaches with acupuncture.",Cluster Headache,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 5

_KC4pNyZSXo,"Hi guys, hope you are beautiful afternoon really hot just been for a quick run. Sorry I'm really hot and sweaty before I go back in the office I thought a really quick video on acute management of cluster headache What do you know for a medical exam question or a medical exam role play now in primary care? Generally, we're not going to see that many acute cluster headaches I tend to go to any for example But you need to know how to manage it if it comes up in an exam question now cluster headaches We've got another video somewhere on YouTube about how it presents the key features, you know, natural red water etc So have a look at that video and if you need a top up on that But how do you manage it now according to nice CKS? There are two things that generally are focused on first for management of plus a headache acutely number one oxygen and number two Sumatriptan, let's start with sumatriptan first So sumatriptan can be given intranasally, but I'm going to talk about the subcutaneous dose subcutaneous or subcut is what we'll focus on here So the dose for subcut sumatriptan in adult is six milligrams given Acutely when the headache is presenting now you can repeat another six milligrams after at least one hour But not if it hasn't responded to the first dose only if it recurs at that time So if it's not responding to the first six milligram dose, you can't give a second six milligrams The maximum you can give in a day is 12 milligrams of subcut Sumatriptan and the dose for intranasal is slightly different. Have a look at nice CKS for that This is just subcut sumatriptan. The other thing that you give is oxygen unless it's contraindicated 100% oxygen will help with the acute management as per nice CKS What do you not give in the acute management cluster headache? Do not give paracetamol do not give non-storied lanteflourities do not give opioids and do not give oral triptans They're not suggested in nice CKS for the management of acute cluster headache Hope this helps much more like this on our YouTube channel Facebook channel Twitter Instagram, dr underscore omen underscore Aurora or dr I'm in a row depending on what channel you're using subscribe share like ask for any other videos that you need doing So much more different types of headaches temporal arteritis migraine subdural got videos of all of these things I have a look at those if it can help in your medical exam questions Online courses face face courses virtual courses audio courses on our website Aurora medical education code UK Remember two things when it comes to cluster headache management acutely according to nice CKS number one sumatriptan subcut number two 100% oxygen hope this helps near the hashtag campus will pass hashtag.

However, no specific date or version is mentioned for the NICE CKS guidelines referenced. The date or year of the video itself is also not explicitly stated. Therefore, while the main source (NICE CKS) is acknowledged, the exact date or version of that source is not provided, leading to a partial score of 3 out of 5."," 3

Explanation: The video presents useful information on the acute management of cluster headaches, particularly regarding the recommended treatments of subcutaneous sumatriptan and oxygen therapy. However, it lacks a balanced discussion of alternative treatment options or a comprehensive overview of the condition. The information is presented from a personal perspective, focusing mainly on exam preparation rather than providing an objective, well-rounded educational resource. While the video covers the key points regarding acute treatment as per NICE guidelines, it does not cite specific research studies or consult multiple expert sources, relying primarily on a single guideline. Overall, while the content is informative for the specific topic covered, the video lacks the depth, objectivity, and breadth of sources to be considered completely balanced and unbiased."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details about additional sources of information, but they are incomplete or limited to local branches of the same organization. The speaker mentions checking the NICE CKS (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Knowledge Summaries) for information on intranasal sumatriptan dosing and contraindications for oxygen therapy. However, no specific links or references are provided for accessing this information. The speaker also promotes their own organization's resources (website, social media channels, online courses) but does not mention any external organizations or sources beyond their own. Therefore, the score of 2 is appropriate as additional sources are mentioned but not fully detailed or expanded beyond the speaker's affiliated organization."," 5

It explains that sumatriptan, a triptan medication, is given subcutaneously or intranasally to treat acute cluster headaches. However, it does not describe the mechanism of action or how sumatriptan achieves its therapeutic effect. For oxygen therapy, it simply states that ""100% oxygen will help with the acute management"" without explaining how oxygen works to alleviate cluster headaches. While the dosages and administration routes are provided, the underlying mechanisms of these treatments are not described in detail. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as the descriptions are incomplete regarding how the treatments work on the body to achieve their effects."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for acute management of cluster headaches. It explains that sumatriptan and 100% oxygen are recommended treatments according to NICE guidelines, but does not explicitly state the benefits or intended effects of these treatments. The focus is more on dosing instructions for sumatriptan. While it implies that these treatments help manage acute cluster headaches, their specific benefits in terms of controlling symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition are not clearly described. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as benefits are only partially covered."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned for acute management of cluster headaches. It provides some information about the dosage and administration of subcutaneous sumatriptan, including the maximum daily dose and the potential for repeat dosing. However, it does not explicitly mention any potential side effects, complications, or adverse reactions associated with sumatriptan or oxygen therapy. The focus is primarily on the recommended treatments and dosing guidelines based on NICE CKS (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Knowledge Summaries) rather than discussing the risks involved. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, as the risks are not comprehensively covered for both treatments mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not include any information about the risks or benefits associated with not treating an acute cluster headache. The video focuses solely on describing the recommended treatments for managing an acute cluster headache according to NICE guidelines, which are sumatriptan and 100% oxygen therapy.

The video focuses solely on describing the acute management of cluster headaches using these treatments as per the NICE CKS guidelines. There is no mention of how these treatments might impact the patient's overall quality of life or their ability to perform daily activities."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The video mentions two treatment options for acute management of cluster headaches: subcutaneous sumatriptan and 100% oxygen therapy. However, it does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what circumstances one option might be preferred over the other. The video also does not suggest any alternatives to consider or investigate further before deciding on a treatment. While it mentions what not to give (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids, oral triptans), it does not present these as potential alternatives to weigh against the recommended treatments. The information provided is somewhat incomplete in terms of presenting multiple treatment choices and their respective indications or contraindications."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While it encourages discussing treatment options with doctors or other healthcare professionals by mentioning the NICE guidelines for managing acute cluster headaches, it does not explicitly suggest discussing the treatment choices with family or friends. The focus of the video is primarily on educating viewers about the recommended treatments (sumatriptan and oxygen therapy) rather than promoting shared decision-making. However, by referencing authoritative guidelines, it indirectly supports having an informed discussion with healthcare providers about the appropriate course of treatment.",set()
PrbIkzAX5xc,"Hi, this is Tom from zero to finals dot com. In this video I'm going to be going through cluster headaches and you can find written notes on this topic at zero to finals dot com slash cluster headaches or in the neurology section of the zero to finals medicine book. So let's jump straight in. Cluster headaches cause severe and unbearable unilateral headaches usually around the eye. And they're called cluster headaches because they come in clusters of attacks and then disappear for a while. For example, a patient might have three to four attacks a day for a week or month followed by a pain free period lasting one to two years. Attacks last between 15 minutes and three hours and they can be triggered by things like alcohol, strong smells or exercise. A typical patient that you might see in your exams who's got cluster headaches is a 30 to 50 year old male smoker coming in with severe pain around one eye. So what are the symptoms? Well cluster headaches are often described as the most severe and intolerable pain in the world. They're sometimes referred to as suicide headaches due to the severity of the pain. And symptoms are all typically unilateral with a red swollen and watery eye, pupil constriction which is called meiosis, eyelid drooping which is called ptosis, nasal discharge and there can be facial sweating on one side. So what are the treatment options for cluster headaches? Well there's the acute management which aims to improve the symptoms of the cluster headache at the time and this can be with triptans, for example sumatriptan injected subcutaneously at the start of the headache. Another option which often comes up in exams is high flow 100% oxygen which is breathed for 15 to 20 minutes to try and improve the symptoms of the headache. And patients are often given oxygen to keep at home to use during the headaches to help with the symptoms. So my top tip at this point is to remember that oxygen is used to treat the symptoms of a cluster headache and this is quite a unique fact that can be brought up in exams. There's also options for prophylaxis to prevent the cluster headaches from occurring and this can be things like verapamil, lithium and prednisolone can actually be used for a short course for two to three weeks to try and break the cycle during a cluster of headache attacks. So thanks for watching, I hope you found this video helpful. If you did, don't forget there's plenty of other resources on the Zero to Find All website including loads and loads of notes on various different topics that you might cover in medical school with specially made illustrations. There's also a whole test section where you can find loads of questions to test your knowledge and see where you're up to in preparation for your exams. There's also a blog where I share a lot of my ideas about a career in medicine and tips on how to have success as a doctor. And if you want to help me out on YouTube, you can always leave me a thumbs up, give me a comment or even subscribe to the channel so that you can find out when the next videos are coming out. So I'll see you again soon.",Cluster Headache,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 5

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments for cluster headaches work, but it lacks a comprehensive explanation of the mechanisms of action for each treatment mentioned. While it briefly mentions that oxygen is used to improve the symptoms during an acute attack and that triptans like sumatriptan are used for acute management, it does not explain how these treatments specifically act on the body to achieve their effects. Similarly, for the prophylactic treatments mentioned (verapamil, lithium, and prednisolone), there is no description of their mechanisms of action in preventing cluster headaches. Therefore, the transcript only partially addresses the question of how the treatments work, warranting a score of 2."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. It mentions that oxygen can be used to ""improve the symptoms of the headache"" and that triptans like sumatriptan can be injected ""at the start of the headache"", implying they can help control or get rid of the acute symptoms. However, the video does not explicitly state the benefits of the prophylactic treatments mentioned (verapamil, lithium, and prednisolone) for preventing future cluster headache attacks or eliminating the condition long-term. Therefore, while benefits are described for some treatments, they are not covered comprehensively for all treatments discussed."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly discuss risks or side effects for most of the treatments, it does mention that prednisolone can be used for a short course of 2-3 weeks, implying that longer-term use may carry risks. However, it does not provide any details on the specific risks or side effects of prednisolone or any of the other treatments mentioned, such as triptans, oxygen therapy, verapamil, or lithium. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as risks are described for at least one treatment (prednisolone), but not for all the treatments discussed."," 1

The transcript does not provide any information about what would happen if no treatment is used for cluster headaches. It focuses entirely on describing the symptoms of cluster headaches and the available treatment options, such as triptans, oxygen therapy, and prophylactic medications like verapamil, lithium, and prednisolone. There is no mention of the risks or benefits associated with postponing treatment, watchful waiting, or permanently forgoing treatment for cluster headaches."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not contain any reference to the overall quality of life or the effects of the treatment choices on day-to-day activity. It focuses primarily on describing the symptoms of cluster headaches, their triggers, and the available treatment options such as triptans, oxygen therapy, and prophylactic medications like verapamil, lithium, and prednisolone. However, it does not discuss how these treatments may impact a patient's daily functioning or overall quality of life. The transcript provides a comprehensive overview of cluster headaches but lacks information specifically related to the impact of treatment choices on quality of life."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. It mentions two categories of treatments: acute management to improve symptoms during an attack (e.g., triptans, oxygen therapy) and prophylaxis to prevent future attacks (e.g., verapamil, lithium, prednisolone). However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one option might be preferred over another. The information is somewhat incomplete in terms of guiding treatment selection based on individual patient factors or circumstances."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While it discusses various treatment options for cluster headaches, such as triptans, oxygen therapy, and prophylactic medications, it does not explicitly suggest discussing these options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The video is primarily focused on providing information about cluster headaches and their management from a medical perspective. However, it does not directly encourage shared decision-making or highlight the importance of involving patients and their support networks in treatment choices.",set()
dM26LYviWhY,"Hello again everyone, my name is Damian and I'm a headache clinician at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. Welcome back to our video series for June Migraine Awareness Month. The topic today is a fairly large one. We're going to talk through the third group of headaches, collectively called the trigeminal autonomic cephaloges or TACs for short. Now these are considered the most debilitating and severe migraines that anyone can experience. So within this third group we have four main primary headache disorders and you may have heard of these in the past. They include most commonly, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemikrania, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival tearing or SUNCT for short and lastly hemikrania continua. Do you know whether you suffer from these headaches? These headache types all present very similarly with only little differentiating factors that separate them. So hopefully today's talk will make it a little bit clearer as to whether or not you may be a sufferer. So today we're going to talk specifically about cluster headaches. According to the Headache International Society, cluster headaches are a rare type of headache, affecting only around 0.1% of the population and affecting males 5-6 times more often than females. Although cluster headaches are uncommon, they are regarded as excruciating and the absolute worst form of headache that you can experience. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as the suicide headache. The pain experienced is of a severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth. Attacks occur in clusters with the duration of attacks anywhere from 15 to 180 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second day. The cluster can last for weeks or months followed by weeks or months of remission, i.e. headache-free periods. It affects one side of the head with pain most commonly around, behind or above the eye and or the temporal region. Associated symptoms can include red and watery eye, runny or congested nose and swelling and drooping of the eyelid. Patients may also experience sweating of the forehead and the face on the side of their symptoms during an attack. So what is the cause of cluster headache? As with many forms of headache, the cause of cluster headache was previously unknown. Medical professionals have been prescribing medications such as tryptans which have been effective at relieving the pain if taken early enough to catch the headache. The effect of tryptans, as most doctors originally thought, was that it predominantly works by helping prevent dilatation of the blood vessels in the head to stop migraines. However, recent studies have shown that dilatation and expansion of the blood vessels are no different to those suffering from a migraine and those who are not. More importantly, the physiology of blood vessels in the head during a cluster headache does not expand, yet patients still benefit from medications such as tryptans. So what is going on? Research that has been conducted over the last 15 years has found that the primary contributing factor of cluster headaches can potentially be a disorder originating in the neck, specifically a fault in the upper cervical spine resulting in a sensitized brain stem which can then induce cluster headaches. Recent research has discovered that tryptans not only help to reduce the dilatation of the blood vessels, but more importantly inhibits information received from the cervical afferents i.e. the nerve endings in the neck. This in turn decreases signals sent to the brain stem and inhibits pain travelling into the head. This information now indicates that cluster headaches and migraines can be a direct result of a sensitized brain stem. Here at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, we are experts in treating headaches and migraines as well as cluster headaches. A thorough examination of the upper cervical spine is initiated to determine the severity of your sensitized brain stem. If you have been found to have a sensitized brain stem and that to be the cause of your cluster headaches, then treatment can begin. The best part about the treatment is that it does not require the use of medication nor any surgery. It is non-invasive and it is completely safe. Hopefully today's video gave you a better idea about cluster headaches. Again if you are a headache sufferer or if this sounds like something that you experience, we can help. So feel free to leave a comment below or message us directly or you can give us a call on 1800 HEADACHE to get started on treating your headaches and migraines. Thanks very much for listening in today guys, I'll see you in the next video.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0," 4

The video has clear aims of explaining what cluster headaches are, their causes, symptoms, and the clinic's approach to treating them. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront; they become apparent as the video progresses. The first few sentences provide an overview of the topic (trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias) but do not directly state the specific aim of discussing cluster headaches in detail. Nevertheless, by the end of the video, it is evident that the main goal is to educate viewers about cluster headaches and promote the clinic's treatment methods. While the aims are discernible, a more explicit statement of purpose at the beginning would have made them clearer."," 4

The video achieves most of its aims in providing information about cluster headaches, which appears to be the main focus. It covers the definition, symptoms, causes, and potential treatment options for cluster headaches in detail. However, it does not provide much information on the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) mentioned initially, such as paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, and hemicrania continua. While it touches upon these conditions briefly, the video primarily focuses on cluster headaches. Overall, it provides comprehensive information about cluster headaches specifically, but partially covers the broader category of TACs that it set out to discuss."," 4 (Partially relevant)

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about cluster headaches, which are a severe form of headache disorder. It discusses the symptoms, causes, and potential treatment options for cluster headaches. However, the video focuses primarily on cluster headaches and does not address other types of headaches or migraines in detail. Therefore, while it is relevant for someone seeking information specifically about cluster headaches, it may not fully address the broader range of questions that readers might have about different types of headaches and migraines."," 2

Explanation: The video partially references some sources of information used to compile the content. It mentions the Headache International Society as a source for the prevalence and characteristics of cluster headaches. It also cites recent research studies that have explored the potential causes and mechanisms of cluster headaches, particularly related to the role of the cervical spine and brain stem sensitization. However, no specific research studies or expert opinions are explicitly referenced or cited for most of the claims made in the video. The sources of evidence are only clear to some extent, hence a partial score of 2 is given."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about recent research on cluster headaches, but it does not clearly state the dates or time periods when this research was conducted. The only date mentioned is that the video is part of a series for June Migraine Awareness Month, but the year is not specified. While the transcript mentions that certain findings have been made ""over the last 15 years,"" it does not provide specific dates or years for the referenced studies or sources of information. Therefore, the score is 2, indicating that only the date of the video itself is partially clear, while the dates for the acknowledged sources of information are not provided."," 3

Explanation:

The video provides information about cluster headaches from a medical perspective, covering causes, symptoms, and potential treatments. However, it also promotes a specific treatment approach offered by the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic, which introduces some bias.

While the video references recent research findings, it does not provide a balanced overview of all available treatment options or cite multiple research studies. The focus is primarily on the clinic's non-invasive, medication-free treatment method for cluster headaches, without objectively discussing other potential treatments.

Additionally, the language used to describe cluster headaches as ""excruciating"" and ""the absolute worst form of headache"" may be perceived as sensational or alarmist, even though the severity of cluster headaches is well-documented.

Overall, while the video offers some objective medical information, the promotional aspect and lack of a comprehensive, balanced discussion of treatment options introduce elements of bias, warranting a partially balanced/unbiased rating."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to cluster headaches or migraines. The transcript is focused solely on explaining what cluster headaches are, their potential causes, and promoting the services offered by the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. There are no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations that could provide advice and information on the topic."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the uncertainty surrounding the causes and treatment of cluster headaches, but the discussion is relatively limited. It mentions that the previous understanding of cluster headaches being caused by dilated blood vessels has been challenged by recent research suggesting a potential link to issues in the upper cervical spine and sensitized brain stem. However, the video does not delve deeper into the details or extent of this uncertainty or differing expert opinions. The mention of a non-invasive and safe treatment offered by the clinic is also quite vague, without elaborating on the specifics or potential limitations or uncertainties surrounding this treatment approach. Overall, while the video acknowledges some uncertainty, the information provided is incomplete and lacks a more comprehensive discussion of the gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning treatment choices for cluster headaches."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatments work. It mentions that triptans were originally thought to work by preventing blood vessel dilation, but recent research suggests they inhibit signals from the cervical spine to the brainstem. It also states that the treatment offered at the clinic is non-invasive, non-surgical, and safe, but does not provide details on how it works to address the sensitized brainstem. While some information is given on the potential mechanism of action, the details are incomplete, especially regarding the specific treatment offered at the clinic."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It states that triptans can provide relief from cluster headache pain if taken early, and that the treatment offered at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic is non-invasive, safe, and does not require medication or surgery. However, it does not explicitly describe the specific benefits or outcomes of the clinic's treatment approach in terms of controlling or eliminating cluster headache symptoms or preventing recurrence. The focus is more on explaining the potential underlying causes of cluster headaches rather than detailing the benefits of the proposed treatment."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments for cluster headaches and migraines. While it does not explicitly mention any risks or side effects of specific treatments, it states that the treatment offered at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic is ""non-invasive and completely safe."" This implies that the treatment approach they use does not carry significant risks or side effects. However, the video does not provide any information about the potential risks or side effects of other treatments, such as medications like triptans, which are briefly mentioned. Therefore, the score of 3 reflects that the video partially addresses the risks or potential side effects of treatments, but only for the specific approach used at the clinic, and not for other commonly used treatments."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any information about the risks or benefits of not treating cluster headaches or pursuing a ""no treatment"" approach such as watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The video focuses solely on describing cluster headaches, their causes, and the clinic's treatment approach. There is no mention of what could happen if cluster headaches are left untreated or if treatment is postponed or avoided altogether."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any information or reference to how the treatment choices for cluster headaches or other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of the patients. The transcript focuses primarily on describing the characteristics, symptoms, and potential causes of cluster headaches, as well as mentioning that the clinic offers non-invasive and safe treatment without providing details on how it impacts the patient's quality of life. There is no explicit discussion or description of the effects of the treatment choices on the overall quality of life or daily activities."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about different treatment options for cluster headaches, such as triptans and cervical spine examination/treatment at the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. However, it does not clearly describe who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what circumstances. Additionally, it does not suggest investigating or considering alternatives before deciding on a particular treatment. The focus is mainly on the clinic's approach of examining the cervical spine and providing non-invasive treatment if a sensitized brain stem is found to be the cause. While this implies there may be different treatment choices, the details are lacking to make it very clear that there are multiple possible options and how to determine the most suitable one."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any support for shared decision-making regarding treatment choices. The content is focused on providing information about cluster headaches, their causes, and the treatments offered by the Brisbane Headache and Migraine Clinic. There are no suggestions or encouragement for patients to discuss treatment options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The video appears to be promoting the clinic's services rather than facilitating shared decision-making between patients and their healthcare providers.",set()
7l7BvjS9b94,"You want to put your head in a vice. I've done everything from pace to cry from the pain. It would be easy to think that Stephen Burley's description of his cluster headaches are an exaggeration, but when you look at drawings online from cluster headache sufferers, you start to get a sense of the intensity of the pain. Your eye is going to explode. Steve learned they're called cluster headaches because they occur in groups every day for weeks or months, then disappear for extended periods, which is different from migraines. Cluster pain is short. The attacks are almost always less than 90 minutes. Migraine attacks last four to seventy-two hours with nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. Cluster travels with redness of the eye, drooping of the lid. Now there may be a non-drug, non-interventional way to get relief from cluster headaches. It's a small battery-powered external nerve stimulator called GammaCore that's used as soon as a cluster headache comes on. The attacks are incredibly intense, but also brief, so giving a drug that takes a couple of hours to kick in like an oral medication is sort of pointless. The GammaCore device is placed over the area of the neck where the vagus nerve travels. It delivers mild electrical stimulation through the skin to the vagus. The impulses are thought to travel up to the brain stem where they short-circuit the headache. A couple of double-blind studies that show a large number of people are pain-free 15 minutes after treating with the vagus nerve stimulator. The GammaCore has just been cleared by the FDA, so it probably won't be available in the U.S. until this fall. Price has not yet been set, but it is expected to be covered by insurance.

There is no mention of what would happen if no treatment is used or if treatment is delayed or permanently forgone. The transcript does not address the question asked."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It mentions that cluster headaches are incredibly intense and painful, suggesting that finding an effective treatment would improve the quality of life for sufferers. However, it does not explicitly discuss the day-to-day impact of the condition or the potential benefits of the GammaCore treatment on daily activities or overall well-being. The information provided about the treatment's effects is limited to its ability to provide relief from the acute pain of cluster headaches within 15 minutes, but it does not delve into its potential impact on overall quality of life."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The transcript mentions two potential treatment options for cluster headaches: the GammaCore device, a non-drug, non-interventional nerve stimulator, and oral medications, although it is stated that oral medications may not be effective due to the brief duration of cluster headache attacks. However, the transcript does not provide a clear comparison of who might benefit more from each treatment option or under what specific circumstances one option might be preferred over the other. It also does not suggest investigating or considering other alternative treatments. While it indicates that there are multiple treatment choices, the information provided is incomplete in terms of guiding the selection between the options mentioned."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by mentioning that the GammaCore device is a non-drug, non-interventional treatment option for cluster headaches that has been recently cleared by the FDA. However, it does not explicitly suggest discussing this treatment option or other choices with family, friends, doctors, or health professionals. The focus of the video is primarily on describing the symptoms of cluster headaches and introducing the GammaCore device as a potential new treatment. While it provides information that could inform shared decision-making discussions, it does not directly encourage or guide such discussions.",set()
ms281RCYuB4,"In this video we will take a look at the characteristics and presentation of a rare but debilitating form of headache: the cluster headache. Enroll in our online course now! Link is in the video description. Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors! Headaches can manifest on their own but are also a very common symptom in neck pain patients as more than 60% of patients with a primary neck pain complaint report of having concordant episodes of headache. Therefore, it's essential to find out what kind of headache the patient is suffering from. to start off, let's differentiate between primary and secondary types of headaches. But what does this mean? Simply put, primary headaches are a disease themselves, whereas in secondary headaches, the headache is a symptom of another condition. So primary headaches would be migraines, tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Secondary-type headaches are headaches caused by tumors, hemorrhage, other trauma ,TMJ dysfunction, substance overuse or neck pain aka the cervicogenic headache. Now, let's take a closer look at cluster headaches which are primary-type headaches.- Cluster headaches have a one-year prevalence of 53 per 100,000 people around the world with men being affected around 3 to 4 times more often than women at the age of 20 to 40. In order for a headache to qualify as cluster headache it has to fulfill certain criteria: A. at least 5 attacks need to fulfill criteria B-D. B. an untreated episode lasts 15 to 180 minutes and shows a severe or very severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and or temporal pain. C. it matches either or both of the following: 1. at least one of the following signs and symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion, and/or rhinorrhea, eyelid edema, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and/or ptosis. 2. A sense of restlessness or agitation. There are reports of patients pacing back and forth through the room banging their heads due to the severe pain. D. It occurs with a frequency between one every other day and eight per day. Tools you can use to assess the impact of a headache on your patient are, for example, the HIT-6 questionnaire which you can find in the video description down below. Also note that it can be difficult for our patient to answer all of the questions on duration, intensity and characteristics of their headache during your initial assessment. Therefore asking them to complete a headache diary can help in the assessment and management of the headache and you should be aware that there can be an overlap between multiple headaches disorders. Okay, you can check out another headache presentation on the left.

YD6q9EXyvZA,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Jacobs. I'm a doctor of physical therapy and I'm the inventor of advanced soft tissue release ASTR specialty. I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. So Eddie, tell me what's going on with your jaw. What's happening? I had clicks when I opened and closed it. This joint right here clicks and I'm grinding my teeth. How long has this been going on? Oh, probably 8 or 9 years maybe. But it's only really gotten bad the last couple months. Did you have any treatment for that? No. Okay, so can you explain to me what kind of symptoms you have because of this clicking? I get headaches and teeth grinding. So how long have you been experiencing the headaches? Three months. And how much headaches from 0 to 10 and where do you feel the headaches? Normally about 3 to 4 and the headaches will be kind of behind my eyes to the back of my head back here. What time of the day is it constant or it comes and goes? Pretty constant. Constant, okay. So you said when is the worst headache in the morning, later morning? Do you have any other symptoms than that? No. Any fullness in the ear ringing? Oh, the ear ringing, yes. Can you explain to me, do you clench, grind? During the day I'll just kind of have my jaw together like this but I don't really grind it. At night time I wear a mouth guard and I grind at night. You grind your teeth at night. So everything we do should not aggravate your symptoms. So currently you feel headache right in here, yeah? Mhm. And how much is now? Right now about 3 to 4. 3 or 4, okay. So you feel it right in here? Yeah. Okay. Have you had any head trauma or accidents? No. So the problem that you clench at night of grinding, that would start your headache? Yeah. Mhm. And you said you grind your teeth, your teeth start to worn out now? Yeah. Okay. And the ringing, excuse me, where do you have it, both ears or one ear? Both ears. Okay. Feel any pain with that? No. Okay. Any trouble opening your jaw? No. Okay. Okay. You feel those bumps here? Yeah. That's scar tissue. Oh really? Yeah. So when you clench at night or grind your teeth, let's say you did that for 5 hours. So it's similar like you are in the gym doing one single exercise for 5 hours. So you are going to have a micro-terrain in the muscle. Oh okay. And then the body has to build the scar tissue, it's part of healing. So that's why it's common with TMG to have those grinding like that scar tissue around the temporal area here. And our muscle should act like a rubber band when it contracts and relaxes. When you have a scar tissue, it's like you have a knot in the rubber band. So when your muscle contracts, it does not stretch. Okay. So when you finish your grind at night, so this muscle starts to get tight, starts to compress on your nerves and arteries and could cause headache symptoms. That's where I feel that. It's common with TMG, jaw pain, that patients have tension headaches. Usually a lot of patients can feel it more in the morning when they wake up from tension a lot at night. Is that too much? No. But you did not have a head trauma did you? No. Do you feel pressure behind your eyes? Sometimes that might be, I have some allergies when the weather changes and stuff. But the headache is normally behind the eyes. Okay so tell me, can you feel any different now? Yeah it feels better. Zero to ten now? Yeah maybe a zero to one. I feel a little bit but not much at all. Just cut back in here? Maybe towards the top more just because the sides don't bother me anymore. Can you tell where the scar tissue is more? It's around your temporalis. That's right. It's like the shape of the temporalis is like half butterfly wings. Now will that ever go away? Can scar tissue go away? Yeah we can help to break down the scar tissue. As long as you don't clench again you're not going to build scar tissue. So I'm going to go over with you after the video what we can do to prevent and decrease the clenching so you know there will be no reason for building scar tissue. Can you notice when I'm working on it that the thickness and the bump feeling on the scar tissue starts to decrease. I'm just shaving it. Sorry I messed up your hair. Oh that's alright. I don't even comb it anymore. Just kind of shake it out. I just cut really short I don't worry about it. You do the same thing like me? Just wash my hair. Just make sure to cover the little bolt I have. You keep as much as you can just so you don't get sunburn. It's not so fair and complex. So you said your headache has been constant for how long now? Probably the last 3 months it's been the worst but it kind of comes and goes. My whole life I remember. Again it's just kind of a dull pain. It's not anything that stops me from doing anything. But it's been nagging for the last 3 months. So tell me how do you feel now from 0 to 10? More like a 0. It feels a lot better. Any other symptoms? No I just feel my teeth kind of in the back or sore. I'm going to work on decreasing the clenching so you don't feel soreness. Soreness in the teeth from a lot of clenching. The headache feels a lot better. So what do you think about ASTR treatment? So far it's worked. Definitely the headache going away is nice. It's easier to concentrate at work. That's awesome.

The aims of the video are partially clear. While the main focus seems to be on demonstrating a treatment technique called ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) for relieving symptoms like headaches and jaw pain, the overall purpose or intended audience is not explicitly stated. The video shows an actual treatment session with a patient, but it's unclear if the primary aim is to educate, promote the technique, or something else. The closing remarks mention subscribing for tips, getting certified in ASTR, and referencing research studies, but these come across as secondary aims rather than a clearly defined main objective."," 4

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information on the ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) treatment method for addressing issues like jaw clicking, teeth grinding, and associated headaches. It demonstrates the treatment process and explains how scar tissue buildup in the temporalis muscle can cause these symptoms. The practitioner also discusses the potential benefits of ASTR in relieving the patient's headache and teeth soreness.

However, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the ASTR technique itself or delve deeply into the underlying mechanisms and scientific evidence supporting its efficacy. While it mentions studies related to ASTR, it does not elaborate on the specifics. Additionally, the video primarily focuses on the treatment for this particular patient case rather than providing a broader educational resource on ASTR for various conditions."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about addressing jaw clicking, teeth grinding, and associated headaches through a treatment called Advanced Soft Tissue Release (ASTR). It demonstrates the application of the ASTR technique on a patient and discusses how it can help alleviate symptoms related to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. However, the information is focused specifically on this particular treatment approach, and may not comprehensively address all potential questions or concerns readers might have regarding TMJ disorders, their causes, and alternative treatment options. Therefore, while the information is relevant to the topic, it may only partially address the broader range of questions readers might have."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript partially mentions some sources of information used to compile the content. The author mentions a ""4-year study that support ASTR treatment model"" and ""over 400 study that utilized by ASTR treatment."" However, no specific references or citations are provided for these studies. Additionally, while the author claims expertise as a doctor of physical therapy and inventor of the ASTR technique, no external sources are cited to support the claims or statements made during the treatment demonstration. The majority of the content appears to be based on the author's personal experience and opinions."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides no clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. The only date mentioned is a reference to a ""4-year study that support ASTR treatment model,"" but the specific year or years are not stated. There is also a mention of ""over 400 study that utilized by ASTR treatment,"" but again no dates are provided for these studies. The transcript itself does not appear to be dated either. Therefore, while the video itself likely has a production date, there are no clear dates given for the main sources of information referenced in the video's content, resulting in a score of 2 (Partially)."," 2

Explanation: The video appears to be heavily biased towards promoting the ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) treatment method invented by the presenter, Dr. Jacobs. While it showcases a treatment session and provides some explanations, the information is presented from a personal and subjective point of view, with a clear intent to market the ASTR technique. There is no reference to other potential treatment options or a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of different approaches. The video relies primarily on anecdotal evidence from a single patient case and self-promotion of the ASTR method, without citing multiple research studies or expert opinions. The language used is emotive and promotional in nature, rather than objective and impartial."," 2

Explanation: The video partially provides details of additional sources of information. While the speaker mentions that there are over 400 studies utilized by the ASTR treatment and a 4-year study that supports the treatment model, no specific sources or references are provided. The speaker also directs healthcare providers interested in ASTR certification to follow a link for information on registering for an online class. However, no details are given about other organizations or resources for further reading or information related to the topic of TMJ disorders and treatment. The additional sources mentioned are limited to resources directly related to the ASTR treatment promoted by the speaker."," 1

The transcript does not mention any uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for the patient's condition (temporomandibular joint disorder or TMJ). The video appears to be focused on promoting a specific treatment approach called Advanced Soft Tissue Release (ASTR) developed by the presenter, Dr. Jacobs. While the treatment is described and its purported benefits are discussed, there is no acknowledgment of alternative treatment options or any discussion of the potential limitations or uncertainties associated with the ASTR approach. The video does not provide a balanced perspective on the various treatment choices available for TMJ disorders or highlight areas where expert opinions may differ."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides a partial description of how the ASTR (Advanced Soft Tissue Release) treatment works. The practitioner explains that the treatment aims to break down scar tissue in the muscles, which can cause tension, compress nerves and arteries, and lead to symptoms like headaches. He demonstrates the technique of ""shaving"" or releasing the scar tissue in the temporalis muscle, leading to a reduction in the patient's headache.

However, the video does not provide a detailed scientific explanation of the physiological mechanisms by which the treatment achieves its effects. The description of how it works remains somewhat superficial and anecdotal. Additionally, no explanation is given for other potential treatments mentioned, such as preventing clenching or grinding of teeth.

Therefore, the score of 3 is appropriate, as the video provides some description of how the ASTR treatment works, but the details are incomplete or lacking in depth."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the ASTR treatment for relieving symptoms like headaches, teeth grinding, and jaw clicking associated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. It demonstrates how the treatment helps reduce muscle tension, scar tissue, and associated headaches in the patient being treated. However, it does not explicitly mention benefits for preventing recurrence or eliminating the underlying condition long-term. The focus is mainly on short-term symptom relief through the ASTR technique. Benefits of other treatments are not discussed."," 2

The video transcript describes some potential risks or side effects associated with grinding teeth and clenching the jaw, such as headaches, ear ringing, tooth wear, and muscle tension/scar tissue buildup. However, it does not explicitly mention any risks or side effects related to the ASTR treatment method being discussed. The focus is primarily on explaining the patient's symptoms and the purported benefits of the ASTR approach, without detailing potential drawbacks or adverse effects of the treatment itself. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as risks are described for the untreated condition but not for the proposed treatment."," 3

Explanation: The video partially addresses the risks or benefits of not treating the patient's condition. While it does not explicitly discuss the consequences of forgoing treatment altogether, it implies that the patient's symptoms (headaches, teeth grinding, ear ringing) would persist or potentially worsen without the ASTR treatment. However, the information provided is limited, and there is no clear description of the specific risks or benefits associated with postponing treatment or watchful waiting. The focus is primarily on the effectiveness of the ASTR treatment itself rather than the alternative of no treatment."," 3

Explanation: The video partially addresses the effects of the treatment choices on overall quality of life. While it does not explicitly discuss the impact on day-to-day activities, it touches upon how the treatment helped alleviate headaches and improve the patient's ability to concentrate at work. However, the information provided is limited and lacks a comprehensive discussion of the overall quality of life implications. The video primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the treatment and the patient's specific symptoms, rather than exploring the broader impact on the patient's daily functioning and well-being."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice, but the information is not very clear or comprehensive. While the practitioner mentions that they will discuss preventative measures and techniques to decrease clenching with the patient after the video, no specific alternative treatment options are described or compared. The focus is primarily on the ASTR technique being demonstrated. There is a lack of detailed information about who might benefit most from different treatment approaches and under what circumstances each approach may be more suitable. The video does not provide a thorough exploration of potential treatment choices for the condition discussed."," 3 (Partially providing support for shared decision-making)

Explanation: The video transcript provides some suggestions for discussing treatment options with healthcare professionals, specifically mentioning that the doctor will explain ways to prevent and decrease clenching after the video. However, there is limited explicit encouragement for shared decision-making with family, friends, or other health professionals beyond the treating doctor. The focus is primarily on the doctor's explanation of the patient's condition and the proposed treatment approach (ASTR). While the patient is engaged in the discussion, there could be more emphasis on actively involving the patient in weighing different treatment choices in collaboration with their support network.",set()

MxwVsT9vivg,"Okay, I want to share with you what the nature of my cluster headaches are like. They always start with a slight burn in the nostril. That's how I know it's a cluster headache. There's no other feeling in this world like the beginning of a cluster headache. So if I haven't had headaches for a while and I'm driving down the road and all of a sudden I feel a burn in my nostril, I don't waste a second getting some medicine in me quickly because we're getting ready to go through another episode of cluster headaches. Once I feel that burn, then it's always kind of a stabbing pain like over my eye or behind my eye. It'll just be like a pulsating stab just for a half a second or so and then there'll be an interval in between 30 seconds, a minute, minute and a half and then I'll start feeling another stab. And the cluster headache will just begin to ramp its way up and it happens very quickly. Within about 10 minutes, I can be in debilitating pain. So once I begin to feel those pulses, then it starts usually seeding more in the eye area and the only way that I can begin to describe what it feels like is that if you grabbed your arm and you just pinched it as hard as you could and just twisted it and you held it there. If you take that pain and you multiply it by about two times, that's what it's like having a cluster headache. It's like somebody's just pinching your eye and they won't stop pinching it and the pain is excruciating and that can last all the way up to an hour and a half. So it works its way into the eye, it builds in intensity and then the pain starts going all the way up in the top of my head and down into my neck and a lot of times it's a stabbing, like pulsating pain where all I can do is just kind of moan and groan and you know I'll say Jesus relieved the pain in one breath and then I'll say the worst first word that will come out of my mouth in the next because the pain is just, it's unbearable. I've been on the floor just screaming and hollering before. Anyway, that's what a cluster headache is like for me. If I don't get the medicine in me quick enough, it starts with a slight burn, I feel some pulsating up here, it begins to work into my eye and begins to pinch gradually slowly until it gets into a deep seated pinching pain and then it works its way up in my head and I feel throbbing all in my jaw area and my neck and in my head.",Cluster Headache,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0," 4

xCb_BPBh5dQ,"Hey, what would you think if you woke up in the middle of the night, say like 2.06, and you felt like somebody had taken the worst torture device in there and trying to pull your eye out of your head from the back through the top of your head. Okay, say like you did that. And then after an hour or so it goes away. Then the next night, 2.06, the person with the device is back, yanking your eye out through the top of your head again. You get up, you roll around, you grab your head like you're going crazy, and then 15-20 minutes later it gets slightly bearable. And then after about an hour or so it sort of just goes away like it was never there. You start to think, oh hey, I guess maybe I have a brain tumor and I'm about to die, I better get my things in order. So anyway, you kind of recover, everything's fine. So you go to bed the next night, 2.06, your friend's back with the tool. So this goes on for like 5 days and then just stops. Never forget about it, but it stops so it's not a big deal anymore. So then you go about your business and a year later, a year later, calendar year later, 2.06, you wake up with excruciating pain and your friend is back after a year in Provence or something. Anyway, and it starts all over again. Those are what are called cluster headaches and I'm one of the lucky recipients of the cluster headache. So it took me a long time to figure out what this was. The weird thing about them is they're harmless. The most excruciating pain known to man. Mostly men get them, mostly men in their 20s, 30s and 40s and then a lot of times they just go away on their own. Some women do get them and the women that have got them have said they're far more painful and more severe than anything related to childbirth. This is some serious pain I'm telling you about. Once you've experienced this, there's nothing you can imagine that's more excruciating. The nickname for them is also suicide headaches and they've shown up throughout history and people have known about them for a long time. They don't seem to have any ill effects and they don't seem to cause any lasting problems which is sort of shocking considering how excruciating these things are. Literally a grown man rolling around on the floor, tears coming out of your eyes, your nose is running just out of excruciating pain and it's so painful you cannot even think. It's impossible to even form a thought. You're lucky if you can get into the bathroom and slug down a couple of aspirin in hopes. I don't even know if that helps. I'm a mild sufferer. So there's people that have chronic cluster or suicide headaches. So my sympathy is out to y'all. I hope this helps enlighten somebody out there. But I would say if you are having any problem like this, go see a doctor. But look into what cluster headaches are first so you can kind of explain that to him because you don't want this to be something worse. But there's things a lot more deadly. Over and out.

iVWa9Lqf8jE,"Hi, my name's Matt. I'm 43 years old. I've been suffering with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches? Suicide headaches? Whatever you want to call them. The beast. It's... How can you explain it unless you have to deal with it? No one will ever understand. Just us. Well anyway, like I say, I've had them since I was 21. I'm 43 years old now. I want to show some of you out there how to split your jabs because I've been reading some of the comments and some of you are just using the whole EpiPen. I split my injections so I can get 8 injections in 2 days instead of 2 injections in a 24 hour period. You might be familiar with these. They come in a different format. I'm going to show you them in a minute. This is how I split these. So there's the trigger mechanism. You need to pull that off. Do not push that button. We all know. That's the trigger. Then you need to break the seal. The seal's broken. Now, then you need to pull it apart. It can be quite difficult. It takes a little bit of time. A little bit of a wiggle. That's how that comes out. Grab hold of that again. Do not push that button. It fries that apart. And that's what you're left with. 40 pounds apparently. Now on here you've got some little stoppers. Either side. Stop that from falling out. So you can bite them open or cut them. A pair of scissors. Cut one side. And the other. Now this will just slide out. He says. OK. And that's what you're left with. Some of these have more than... Some of them have more in them than others for some reason. I'm not sure why. I'm going to sort of say I only take two in a 24 hour period. But what I do with this. I'm going to put this in a syringe. If you can't get hold of needles. You can just use this. And that's what I did for many years. I would get a cotton bud. I would put that in my upper thigh. And I would administer. Maybe half or a quarter. As soon as the attack started. As soon as I had an inkling. And it would just go. After five minutes it would go. And it was more or less the same as having a hole here. And then just feeling absolutely crap. Because it just used to knock the stuffing out of me. Having a whole one of these just used to put me on my back. So like I say. Luckily I've got a friend that gets me these. Sounds so dodgy doesn't it. But they're actually diabetic. You can't get them from your doctors. You can go to chemists and ask for them. They think you're addicted to something. But you know I just don't care. You can get one of them. Okay so this is going to go in here. And you just gently squeeze it in. Okay. So that's full. You can get the bubbles out of it. As usual it's just. You will. You just keep tapping it. Get the bubbles all out. You'll end up with that. Okay. So it goes one to four. And that's usually what you get in there. Sometimes you get five. But for me that's my hit. So out of this I get four injections. Just out of one EpiPen. Two EpiPens. Eight injections. Over a 24 hour period. And that's how I've been coping. As soon as they occur. Especially when they're chronic. I just take a shot. I've got my own little case. I preload these. I do it sort of every other day. So you know I preload my pens. And this has been my survival. If you're not getting these. I mean. Many years ago I was getting these. And these were so easy to use. And I found out on Ouch! how to split these. And they were just so easy. So you take the pen out. And some of you may well be getting these. I went to pick up a prescription and they gave me these after three years of getting those pens. So I'm not quite sure. Anyway. Stick that in there. Twist there. Pull it out. And that's ready to go. That's what you would inject. Instead of that. And twist the end. Pull it out. And there you go. How easy was that? I wish I got these every time. But I don't. So that's how I split my jabs. And like I say. I would administer this. In my upper thigh. I hate injections. But because of the pain. We all know what the pain is about. Nothing compares. So I know. Just a little prick. So to speak. It's going to make me feel a lot more better than if I didn't. Okay. I hope this helps. Email me or message me with any other questions. I might be able to answer them or help you a little bit. Just remember. You are not alone. I've been suffering this for as long as I can imagine. It's crippling. It sucks. But there are people out there that care and understand. I've never actually spoken about it before. I just go for it on my own. But it's wonderful to hear from and listen to other people's stories. And to see how they're coping. Just another thing. That I found out is supposed to be really good. Veraptamol. I've tried it. Unsuccessfully for me. It might help other people. When you go to the doctors. Do not leave that doctor until they've prescribed you the injections. Or these. You must have the injections and the oxygen. Get an appointment straight away. A neurologist. I know it takes forever. But once diagnosed. They can't refuse to give you these injections. When I pick up a repeat prescription. I get these. I get ten of these. Sometimes I get twelve. I'm not paying £7.80 a throw. Whatever it is for just two of these. I'm going in and picking up a bag of ten. And I'm surviving. Peace out people. Love you lots.",Cluster Headache,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0," 4

Explanation: The video has a clear overall aim of showing how the speaker splits and administers medication to manage cluster headaches. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront and have to be inferred from the content.

While helpful for understanding one person's approach, it may not comprehensively address all potential questions readers might have about cluster headaches and their treatment options."," 3

Explanation: The video partially mentions some sources of information and evidence, but does not provide clear references for all the main claims or statements made. The speaker mentions reading comments from others and learning how to split EpiPen injections from the website ""Ouch!"". However, most of the information shared appears to be based on the speaker's personal experiences and anecdotal evidence. No specific research studies or expert opinions are cited as sources for the advice or information provided regarding cluster headache treatment and management. The video could be improved by providing more explicit references to credible sources for the various claims and recommendations made."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides no clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the content. The only date mentioned is the speaker's age (43 years old), which implies when the video itself was recorded, but there are no specific dates given for any other sources or references cited. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the score for this video transcript is 2 (Partially), as only the approximate date of the video itself can be inferred, but no dates are provided for any acknowledged sources or information used to create the video content."," 3

Explanation: The video presents a personal account and experience of managing cluster headaches, specifically focusing on the technique of splitting injectable medications to extend their use. While the information provided is based on the individual's personal experience and preferences, it lacks a balanced discussion of alternative treatment options or input from medical experts or research studies. The tone is conversational and anecdotal, without an objective evaluation of the risks or efficacy of the described method. However, the video does not appear to be overtly biased or sensationalized, simply sharing one person's coping strategy. Overall, the information is somewhat unbalanced due to its singular perspective, but not entirely biased or lacking in potential value for others suffering from cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details about additional sources of information and support, but these are limited and incomplete. The speaker mentions reading comments from others and finding information on a platform called ""Ouch!,"" but no specific details are given about these sources. The speaker also suggests reaching out to them directly via email or messaging for additional questions or help.

The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. The speaker, Matt, discusses his personal experience and methods of administering medication injections to manage his cluster headache attacks, but he does not delve into any uncertainties or differences in expert opinions about treatment options. The focus is solely on sharing his own coping strategies without addressing potential uncertainties or debates surrounding the treatments."," 2

The transcript provides some details on how the treatments (injections) work to alleviate cluster headaches, but the explanations are generally limited and incomplete. The speaker mentions that the injections help stop the attacks within 5 minutes and make the pain go away, but there is no clear description of the mechanism of action or how the drugs act on the body to achieve this effect. The focus is primarily on demonstrating how to split and administer the injections rather than explaining their underlying pharmacological mechanisms. Some additional details on how these treatments work physiologically would have been helpful to fully answer the question."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. The speaker explains how splitting the injectable medication allows them to get more doses out of each pen/vial and administer smaller amounts as soon as a cluster headache starts, which helps abort or stop the headache attack. However, no specific benefits are described for the oxygen treatment that is briefly mentioned. The video focuses more on providing instructions for preparing and self-administering the injectable medication rather than comprehensively covering the benefits of each treatment option."," 2

The video partially describes the risks associated with the treatments for cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly mention the potential side effects or adverse reactions, the speaker acknowledges the potency of the injections and how they can cause him to feel ""absolutely crap"" or ""knock the stuffing out of me."" He also mentions that he dislikes injections but tolerates them due to the severity of the pain. However, the video does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the specific risks or complications associated with the different treatments mentioned, such as injections, oxygen therapy, or the medication verapamil."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially mentions the risks and benefits of not using treatment for cluster headaches. The speaker implies that not taking the injectable medication would result in severe, debilitating pain from the cluster headaches, which he refers to as ""the beast"" and ""suicide headaches."" However, there is no explicit description of the specific risks or benefits of forgoing treatment altogether. The focus is primarily on the speaker's method of splitting doses to make the medication last longer rather than a comprehensive discussion of the consequences of no treatment."," 2

The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices (splitting EpiPen injections) affect overall quality of life. The speaker mentions that splitting the injections and taking smaller doses allows them to manage the cluster headache attacks more effectively and avoid the debilitating effects of taking a full dose, which would ""knock the stuffing out of me"" and ""put me on my back."" However, there is no direct or explicit reference to the impact on overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The focus is primarily on the practical aspects of splitting and administering the injections."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches. The speaker mentions using injectable medications like Imitrex (sumatriptan) injections and oxygen therapy, as prescribed by a neurologist. However, the information provided is mostly focused on the speaker's personal experience with splitting and self-administering the injectable medication. There is limited discussion about who might benefit more from one treatment over another or under what specific circumstances alternatives should be considered. The video could have provided a more comprehensive overview of the different treatment options available and their potential pros and cons for different patients."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The speaker encourages viewers to discuss treatment options with their doctors and to insist on getting prescribed the necessary medications (injections and oxygen). However, the focus is primarily on self-management techniques for administering the injections rather than actively involving others in the decision-making process. There is little explicit mention of discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or health professionals beyond obtaining prescriptions. While the video provides practical advice for managing cluster headaches, it could have offered more guidance on collaborative decision-making with healthcare providers and loved ones.",set()
Q8DBJisYeXY,"Hey everybody, I'd like to talk to you today about headache. I have friends who get headaches, really bad ones, migraine headaches, and some of them even get these cluster headaches where they feel like they want to beat their head against a concrete wall just to stop the headache. Well, I've got a friend, my old next door neighbor, who's the world premiere expert on headache, Dr. Bernstein, and he told me some secrets. Now look, he told me, and I'm just telling you, I'm not a doctor, but I told my friends about these headache cures and they keep texting me and emailing me saying, this headache cure saved my life, how come I've never heard about it? The reason you haven't heard about it is because the medical world isn't going to make any money off these. So here they are.

There's a certain feeling somebody gets, they know after they've had migraines before in cluster headaches, they can feel it coming earlier before the headache starts, the little clue it's coming. When you feel that, grab a rag, a cold rag, put it behind the back of your neck. Close your eyes and sit in a dark room. That's one thing. Here's the other thing. Oxygen. 100% oxygen for 10 minutes.

The transcript starts with a personal anecdote about friends with headaches and then transitions into discussing potential remedies for headaches, particularly migraines and cluster headaches. However, the overall objective or purpose of the video is not clearly outlined. It seems to be a mix of sharing personal experiences and offering advice on headache treatments, but the aims are not concisely communicated. The lack of a clear introduction or stated goals makes the aims somewhat unclear or incomplete."," 2

The video provides some anecdotal information and home remedies for treating headaches, particularly migraines and cluster headaches. However, it falls short in achieving its aims of providing comprehensive information on the topic of headaches.

While the video mentions the use of caffeine, cold compresses, and oxygen therapy as potential remedies, it lacks crucial details such as the scientific basis for these treatments, their effectiveness, potential side effects, and contraindications. Additionally, the video does not cover important aspects like the different types of headaches, their causes, diagnostic methods, and other evidence-based treatment options.

To fully achieve its aims, the video should have included more factual and medical information from credible sources, rather than relying solely on personal experiences and recommendations from a friend. A balanced and comprehensive discussion of headache management would have been more informative and valuable for the audience."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about potential remedies for headaches, specifically mentioning the use of caffeine, cold compresses, and oxygen therapy. However, it lacks crucial details and scientific evidence to fully address the questions readers might have regarding headache management. The information is primarily anecdotal, based on the speaker's friend's recommendations, rather than being grounded in medical expertise or research. While the suggested remedies may be helpful for some individuals, the lack of comprehensive explanations, dosages, or potential side effects makes the information only partially relevant for those seeking reliable medical advice on headache treatment."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not mention any specific sources of information or evidence to support the claims made about headache cures. The only reference made is to an unnamed ""Dr. Bernstein"" who is described as the speaker's ""old next door neighbor"" and the ""world premiere expert on headache."" However, no further details or credentials are provided to establish the credibility of this individual as an expert source. The speaker acknowledges that they are ""not a doctor"" and are simply relaying information from their friend. The video does not cite any research studies, medical literature, or expert opinions from recognized authorities in the field of headache treatment. The claims about using Coca-Cola, caffeine, cold rags, and oxygen therapy are presented without any references to substantiate their efficacy or scientific basis."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear dates for the sources of information used in the video. While it mentions that the speaker got the information from a friend who is an expert on headaches, Dr. Bernstein, there is no date given for when this information was obtained or when Dr. Bernstein's research was conducted. The video itself also lacks any date or timestamp indicating when it was produced. Without any dates or time references for the sources of information, it is impossible to determine the recency or validity of the information presented. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate, indicating that no dates have been given for the acknowledged sources or the video itself."," 2

Explanation: The video presents a personal and anecdotal perspective on treating headaches, relying primarily on the advice of a single expert and the experiences of the speaker's friends. While it offers specific remedies, it lacks a balanced discussion of other treatment options or a comprehensive review of research studies on the topic. The language used is informal and subjective, with phrases like ""world premiere expert"" and ""headache cure saved my life,"" which can be seen as sensational or exaggerated claims. The video does not provide a clear indication that a range of sources was consulted or that different viewpoints were considered. Overall, the information presented appears to be somewhat biased and lacks the objectivity expected from a medical expert."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to headaches and their treatment. The speaker mentions his neighbor, Dr. Bernstein, as an expert on headaches, but does not provide any contact information or resources associated with him. The speaker mainly discusses his personal recommendations for treating headaches, such as drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold compress, and using oxygen therapy, but does not refer to any external sources, organizations, or further reading materials that could provide more comprehensive information on the topic."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for headaches. The speaker presents various remedies, such as drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold rag to the neck, and inhaling pure oxygen, as definitive solutions without acknowledging potential limitations or differences in expert opinions. There is no discussion of the scientific evidence or efficacy of these treatments, nor any acknowledgment of alternative approaches or the possibility of individual variations in treatment responses. The speaker presents the information as factual and does not allude to any uncertainties or debates surrounding the recommended treatments."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the suggested treatments (cold rag, oxygen) work to alleviate headaches or migraines. However, the descriptions are very brief and lack detailed explanations of the mechanisms by which these treatments act on the body to achieve their effects. The mention of caffeine and carbonation as potentially helpful for existing headaches is not accompanied by any explanation of how they work. Overall, while some treatments are mentioned, the transcript does not provide a clear or comprehensive description of how each treatment functions to relieve headache symptoms."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for headaches. It suggests that drinking Coca-Cola (due to the caffeine and carbonation) can help relieve an existing headache. Additionally, it recommends using a cold rag on the back of the neck and inhaling 100% oxygen for 10 minutes when feeling the early signs of a migraine or cluster headache, as these methods can either prevent the headache from occurring or reduce its severity. However, the transcript does not explicitly mention any long-term benefits or the prevention of recurrence for these treatments. It focuses primarily on short-term relief or prevention of individual headache episodes."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not describe any risks or potential side effects associated with the suggested treatments for headaches (drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold rag to the neck, and inhaling 100% oxygen). While it provides advice on using these methods to alleviate or prevent headaches, there is no mention of potential complications, adverse reactions, or long-term risks related to these treatments. The video solely focuses on presenting the treatments as potential remedies without discussing their potential downsides or risks."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not mention any risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for headaches or migraines. The video focuses solely on suggesting potential remedies or treatments for headaches, such as drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold rag to the neck, sitting in a dark room, and using 100% oxygen. It does not discuss the consequences or outcomes of not using any treatment or taking a ""watchful waiting"" approach to headaches or migraines."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any information about how the suggested treatment choices (drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold rag, or using oxygen therapy) affect overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The video focuses solely on describing potential remedies for headaches, without discussing their impact on the overall well-being or functional ability of the person experiencing headaches. There is no reference to how these treatments might influence activities of daily living or overall quality of life."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for headaches, but the information is incomplete and lacks clarity. While the speaker mentions a few potential remedies, such as drinking Coca-Cola, applying a cold rag to the neck, and using 100% oxygen, there is no clear description of who might benefit most from each treatment or under what specific circumstances one treatment might be preferred over another. The video also fails to suggest any alternatives to investigate further or provide a balanced perspective on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed treatments. Overall, the video presents a limited and one-sided view of headache treatments without adequately addressing the complexities and potential choices involved."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any support for shared decision-making. The speaker is sharing some purported home remedies for headaches, but does not suggest discussing treatment options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The speaker explicitly states that they are not a doctor and implies that these ""cures"" are not known or recommended by the medical world. The video lacks any encouragement for patients to engage in shared decision-making with healthcare providers regarding their treatment choices.",set()
R_ienaIhKO0,"I don't have any phobias. I don't mind spiders. I think snakes are great. Being in the dark, funny noises, nothing like that particularly scares me. But I am scared of the beast. I currently work in London at a place called the Shell building. Which I am very very fortunate in that the Shell building is no more than a three minute walk from London Waterloo terminal. My role is planning manager which means I spend maybe two days a week sat in front of a computer analysing all the information I've got. I love coming home mainly because I love my wife. So I know that as I'm walking up the road through the path, through the woods, I know I'm only a couple of minutes away from a hug with my wife. She is the mainstay of my day. We've got a great house. It's an end of terrace, three bedroom, nice quiet road. It's great. It's a lovely place to live. It's a nice area. Now I live in Chandler's Ford. It's a much much bigger place but it's got that same homely friendly atmosphere. My parents are both in their 80s. My mum has just had this major surgery. Dad doesn't drive, has never driven apart from driving people mad or being a backseat driver. So I take them and do their weekly shopping with them. My brother as well as being my brother is my best friend. And like good friends do, we enjoy a pint. So we've got a very very good real ale pub a few miles from where he lives. So I pick them up and we go and have a pint. It does us both good. I love real ales and this is a dying breed this pub. It's a proper pub. It has real ales and it's got a dark horse. It's everything I want in a pub. I spend as much time as I can with my wife. We're fortunate that they've got very similar tastes. She will come motor racing with me to watch the racing and to make sure that I don't get into trouble. And I will go to her to visually impaired cricket. And a few years ago when they set up a cricket team they asked the volunteers to help. I had time on my hands so I went along. I'm undergoing training as a scorer. My wife is one of the coaches. I go along and hopefully add the numbers up. I knew that having a profession that involved numbers one day would drag me down and here we are. Out of nowhere I get a bright shiny headache that starts off in my left eye. And I know within a matter of seconds I'm going to be a necky. My left eye will close and droop. My eye will be watering cochlearly as if I'm crying on one side of my face. But the obvious give away is the fact that I'm going to be curled up in the fetal position. Wrapping my arms around my head and curled up. Stamping, stamping my feet. Hitting whatever is near me. And I hit things so that my hand hurts and takes my mind off the pain. If I am fortunate enough to be able to move then I carry an injection kit with me. And it is... It's a miracle because if I can manage to load the injection and if I can manage to inject myself, within five minutes the pain will be gone. If I can't I'm looking at 20 to 30 minutes of seriously, seriously wishing I was dead. Which is why they're called suicide headaches. I don't have any phobias. But I am scared of the beast. I can't hide from it. I can't run from it. It's with me all the time and I carry it with me. That's what the beast has done to me. That's what the beast has done to me.",Cluster Headache,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 2

The aims of the video are partially clear. The speaker talks about their life, job, family, hobbies, and a medical condition they suffer from, which seems to be cluster headaches or ""suicide headaches"" as they refer to it. However, the overall purpose or central aim of sharing this personal information is not explicitly stated. The video appears to be a narration of the speaker's life and struggles with a debilitating condition, but the broader context or intended message is unclear from the transcript alone."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims of describing the speaker's life and experiences with cluster headaches (referred to as ""the beast""). It provides details about the speaker's personal life, family, and hobbies, as well as a vivid description of the severe pain and symptoms associated with cluster headaches. However, it does not provide much information about the causes, triggers, or treatment options for cluster headaches beyond mentioning the use of an injection. More medical details about this condition could have been included to fully meet the aims of educating viewers about cluster headaches."," 3

The transcript provides some relevant information about the speaker's experience with cluster headaches, which are severe and debilitating headaches often referred to as ""suicide headaches."" The speaker describes the symptoms, including the intense pain, drooping eye, and the need to take an injection to alleviate the pain.

However, the transcript also includes a significant amount of irrelevant information about the speaker's personal life, such as their job, family, hobbies, and preferences, which do not directly address the topic of cluster headaches or provide useful medical information.

Overall, while the transcript touches on the subject of cluster headaches and the speaker's personal experience with them, it lacks a comprehensive or in-depth discussion of the condition, its causes, treatment options, or other relevant medical information that readers might seek."," 1

The video transcript does not mention any sources of information or evidence from research studies or expert opinions to support the claims made. The speaker is narrating their personal experiences and struggles with cluster headaches, often referred to as ""the beast."" While the description of the condition and its impact on the speaker's life seems genuine and detailed, there are no references provided to any external sources that could corroborate the information shared. The entire transcript appears to be based solely on the speaker's personal account without citing any external sources of information."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any explicit dates or years for the sources of information used in the video. The only date-related information given is the mention of the speaker's mother undergoing a recent major surgery and his parents being in their 80s, which gives a rough timeline for the speaker's current life situation. However, there are no specific dates or years mentioned for any external sources or references used in compiling the video content. Therefore, the score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that while the date of the video itself may be clear (based on when it was uploaded), no dates are provided for acknowledged sources of information."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript presents a personal account of an individual's experience with cluster headaches, commonly referred to as ""the beast."" While it provides an emotional and vivid description of the condition's impact on the narrator's life, it lacks objective information from medical sources or experts. The transcript focuses solely on the narrator's personal perspective and does not offer a balanced or unbiased view of cluster headaches or treatment options. The language used is emotive and sensational at times, which could be considered biased or alarmist. However, the personal nature of the account does not necessarily make it completely unbalanced or biased, as it accurately reflects the narrator's subjective experience with the condition."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details or suggestions for additional sources of support or information related to the medical condition described (cluster headaches or ""suicide headaches"").

The focus is solely on the personal experience and effects of the condition."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any details on how treatments work or act on the body to achieve their effects. The speaker talks about experiencing severe headaches (referred to as ""the beast"") and mentions carrying an injection kit that can provide relief within 5 minutes if they can manage to inject themselves. However, there is no description of how the injection or treatment works to alleviate the headache or its mechanism of action on the body. The transcript focuses mainly on the personal experiences and impact of the headaches on the speaker's life, without delving into the specifics of how treatments function."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not describe any benefits of treatments for the medical condition (which seems to be cluster headaches or ""suicide headaches"" as mentioned). It only mentions that the speaker carries an injection kit and that if they can inject themselves, the pain will be gone within 5 minutes. However, it does not provide any further details about the treatment, such as controlling or preventing future episodes, potential side effects, or long-term benefits. The transcript focuses primarily on the speaker's personal experiences with the condition and its impact on their life."," 1

The transcript does not describe any risks, side-effects, complications or adverse reactions associated with the treatment (injection) mentioned for the speaker's condition. The transcript is a personal account of the speaker's experience with severe headaches and how they manage them with an injection, but it does not provide any information about the potential risks or downsides of that treatment.

The transcript does not provide a clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for the condition described (which seems to be cluster headaches or ""suicide headaches""). While it vividly portrays the intense pain and debilitating effects of the headaches, it does not explicitly discuss what would happen if the injections or other treatments were not used. There is a brief mention of wishing for death when unable to take the injection, suggesting the severe consequences of not treating an attack.

FnIxSrFeB7M,"Hi, I want to talk to you about cluster headaches and how to get them cured. There's no strings attached. I just really want to help. I had them for seven years. I had them on both sides of my face. I used to rage anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour and a half to two hours. Sometimes maybe four or five hours the whole night. What I used to do is I used to have got to bed when I went to bed. Before I went to bed I went to sleep. I got everything ready. It was a hot water bottle. I used to get a hot water bottle and a bean bag in the microwave. I had a bucket of ice as well. Next to my bed I had my oxygen and a carrier case. I need to take it around. What I used to do with this I had this kind of attachment and I actually used to use the cold air that was coming out of here to cool the inside of my gums. What causes a cluster headache is many many theories and all that kind of stuff has been suggested. There's one doctor Dr. Elliot Schevel who at the headache clinic did a ligation in an artery that runs my upper jaw. Basically what happens is the blood vessel dilates, squeezes the nerve against the trigeminal nerve against the bone and wears the mileage heath away and short circuits the nerve telling the brain that your face has been ripped off. So you've got chronic nose, eye, teeth ache, your ear aches and you want to rub and cry and pace and scream and sway and yeah it was pretty bad. My lifestyle never went out. I knew at night I used to get them. I never used to drink. I couldn't enjoy other people's food. Just to fear there was things that would trigger it off that were in the food and I sort of narrowed it down to basically any drink that's carbonated used to narrow it down. I had to stop smoking because just the smoking would induce it. MSG, monosodium glutamate, modified starch, too much sugar, preservatives, fruit juices, dried fruits, anything like that would trigger this headache. Even a fisherman's that fisherman mint used to do. I used to sleep upright so I never I didn't lie flat and basically it's a very nasty headache to live with and I suggested if anything I'm saying to you sounds familiar I suggest you get hold of the headache clinic find out what they do and how they do it. You can contact them, you can phone them, you can also contact get onto the website the website is www.theheadacheclinic.co.za and you can also find Dr. Chaville's work and procedures that have been put onto Wikipedia. He's been doing this since 1995. He's got a state of life facility and I suggest you go and take your life back and that's really what I did. I have my life back so I also want to take this opportunity if Dr. Chaville if you are listening I want to just thank you and your team of nurses your specialized nurses and your state of life facilities for giving me back my life. I didn't know I could have been it was so easy and so quick to get cured and I'm completely completely headache free. I can drink beer, I can have starch, I can eat a slab of chocolate. It's just wonderful getting your life back and watching also how happy people are that this has affected because really this does affect the loved ones around you they don't know what to do how to look after you how they can help you and it's a very stressful time for them as well. So for you for your loved ones I suggest you get hold of Dr. Chaville at the headache clinic and let him take care of you because he's a pioneer in this industry and he knows exactly what's going on and you won't be the first if you're coming from the end of the earth you won't be the first and you won't be the last. So good luck take your life back if you want to know any more information just leave a message whatever I'll try to get back to you.",Cluster Headache,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0," 5

The aims of the video are clear. The speaker explicitly states at the beginning that he wants to talk about cluster headaches and how to get them cured. Throughout the transcript, he shares his personal experience with cluster headaches, the symptoms, triggers, and his journey to finding a cure through a procedure performed by Dr. Elliot Schevel at the Headache Clinic. The primary aim is to raise awareness about cluster headaches and promote the treatment offered by Dr. Schevel as an effective solution. He encourages viewers to contact the Headache Clinic and provides the website information."," 3

The video provides some useful information about cluster headaches, including potential triggers, symptoms, and a suggested treatment approach involving surgery on a specific artery. However, it falls short in comprehensively achieving its stated aim of explaining ""how to get them cured."" While it recommends consulting a particular doctor and clinic, it lacks detailed information on the various treatment options, their effectiveness, potential risks or side effects, and other crucial aspects one would expect in a video aimed at providing a comprehensive guide to curing cluster headaches. The personal anecdotes and recommendations are valuable, but the video could have been more thorough in addressing its stated objective."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about cluster headaches, including symptoms, triggers, and a potential treatment option. It discusses the theory behind the treatment method and provides the website and contact information for the headache clinic that offers this treatment. However, the transcript focuses primarily on one specific treatment approach and does not comprehensively cover other potential treatments or management strategies for cluster headaches. Therefore, while the information is relevant to some extent, it may not fully address all the questions readers might have about cluster headaches and their treatment options."," 2

The video provides some references to sources, but they are limited. The main source referenced is Dr. Elliot Schevel and his work at the headache clinic, including a specific procedure he performs. However, most of the information in the video appears to be based on the speaker's personal experience with cluster headaches and the treatment they received. While the speaker mentions theories about the causes of cluster headaches, no specific sources are cited for these theories. Overall, the sources of evidence are partially clear, but many of the claims and statements are not explicitly referenced or supported by external sources."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates related to the sources of information, but not for all acknowledged sources. The only clear date mentioned is 1995, when Dr. Elliot Schevel started performing the ligation procedure for cluster headaches. However, there are no dates provided for the other sources of information, such as the website (www.theheadacheclinic.co.za) or the Wikipedia page mentioned. Additionally, there are no dates associated with the personal experiences and anecdotal information shared by the speaker. Therefore, while some dates are provided, there is a lack of clarity regarding the dates for all acknowledged sources, resulting in a score of 3 (Partially)."," 2

The video is narrated from a highly personal point of view and relies primarily on the presenter's own experience with cluster headaches and a specific treatment. While the presenter mentions a doctor (Dr. Elliot Schevel) and a clinic (The Headache Clinic), there is no reference to other experts, research studies, or alternative treatment options. The information is presented in an anecdotal and promotional manner, praising the treatment and the doctor without providing balanced information on potential risks, side effects, or contrasting viewpoints. The video lacks objectivity and fails to present a range of sources or perspectives, making it a biased account focused on promoting a particular treatment approach."," 2

The video provides some details about an additional source of information, which is the Headache Clinic and its website (www.theheadacheclinic.co.za). However, it does not provide information about other organizations or resources that could offer advice and support related to cluster headaches. The details provided are specific to the Headache Clinic, which appears to be a local organization or facility where the speaker received treatment. Therefore, the score is 2 (Partially), as the video provides an additional source, but it is limited to a single local organization."," 1

The video transcript does not mention any uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. The speaker firmly endorses the treatment approach of Dr. Elliot Schevel at the Headache Clinic, which involves a surgical ligation of an artery near the trigeminal nerve. The speaker enthusiastically recommends this treatment and does not discuss any alternative treatments or differing expert opinions. There is no discussion of areas of uncertainty or debate surrounding the best way to treat cluster headaches."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how different treatments work for cluster headaches, but the descriptions are not comprehensive or clear for all treatments mentioned. It explains that using cold air from an oxygen tank can help cool the trigeminal nerve, and that Dr. Schevel's ligation procedure involves tying off an artery near the trigeminal nerve to prevent dilation and compression. However, it does not clearly describe the mechanisms of other treatments like using hot water bottles, ice buckets, or avoiding certain foods and drinks. The overall description of how treatments work is partial and could have been more detailed."," 3

Explanation:
The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It highlights that the surgical procedure performed by Dr. Chaville helped eliminate the cluster headaches and allowed the speaker to resume a normal life without triggers. However, the benefits of other treatments like using oxygen, hot water bottles, and ice packs are not explicitly stated, although they are mentioned as coping mechanisms. The video focuses more on describing the speaker's experience with cluster headaches and promoting Dr. Chaville's treatment rather than comprehensively discussing the benefits of each treatment mentioned."," 3

The transcript partially describes the risks or side effects of treatments for cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects associated with specific treatments, it indirectly acknowledges some potential risks or complications by describing the severe and debilitating nature of cluster headaches, including chronic pain, inability to enjoy food or drinks, and significant impact on lifestyle and loved ones. However, it does not provide details on the potential risks or adverse effects of the treatments themselves, such as surgical procedures or medications. The focus is more on the benefits of seeking treatment and the positive impact it had on the speaker's life."," 1

Explanation: The transcript of the YouTube video does not provide any clear description or mention of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for cluster headaches. The speaker primarily focuses on describing their personal experience with cluster headaches, the triggers that induced them, and the relief they experienced after undergoing a procedure performed by Dr. Elliot Schevel. There is no discussion about what could happen if no treatment is pursued, the risks of postponing treatment, or the potential benefits or drawbacks of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The video seems to strongly encourage seeking treatment without considering the option of not receiving treatment."," 1

The transcript does not provide any clear reference to the overall quality of life in relation to the treatment choices mentioned. While the speaker talks about the debilitating effects of cluster headaches on their daily life, such as not being able to enjoy food, drinks, or socialize, there is no description of how the suggested treatment (surgery by Dr. Chaville) would affect these aspects of quality of life. The only mention of the treatment's impact is a general statement that it ""cured"" the headaches and allowed the speaker to regain their life, without specific details on improvements in day-to-day activities or overall well-being."," 2

Explanation: The video provides information about a specific treatment approach for cluster headaches, which involves a surgical procedure performed by Dr. Elliot Schevel at the headache clinic. However, the video does not clearly describe other potential treatment choices or alternatives for cluster headaches. It primarily focuses on promoting Dr. Schevel's approach as the solution and does not extensively discuss who might benefit most from this treatment or under what circumstances it should be considered over other options. While the video briefly mentions that there are ""many many theories"" about the causes of cluster headaches, it does not explore different treatment approaches in detail. Therefore, the information provided is somewhat unclear and incomplete in terms of presenting multiple treatment choices and their respective indications."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting that viewers discuss their condition and treatment options with healthcare professionals, specifically Dr. Elliot Schevel and the team at the Headache Clinic. However, it does not explicitly encourage viewers to involve family or friends in the decision-making process or to have comprehensive discussions about the various treatment choices available. The focus is primarily on promoting the specific treatment offered by Dr. Schevel's clinic, rather than a broader exploration of shared decision-making principles.",set()
XWAq1AUFUqA,"Hello, my name is Jeff Parker and I am a 42 year cluster headache survivor. It has been 25 months since my last headache and believe me I don't want another one, let alone another cycle. These are just some of the treatments that I used and what I would do again and what I would do differently. First off let me just tell you about two websites clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters. Google them, they are a wealth of information for us who suffer with them and also family members that have to deal with us. So I strongly advise you check those out. I was 20 years old when they started, 19 or 20 and I landed on aspirin, not just aspirin, but anacin because of the caffeine in it. Excedrin would work too but it upset my stomach more so I was on anacin my whole life and lots of it. Doc did put me in the first 10 years on inderol for about 3 years and I don't remember having that any effect whatsoever so I got off of it. I took a lot of aspirin, too many but you know you want to get rid of that headache. I never really knew when they were going to come and they only used to come one at a time, once a week, twice a week or twice a month, you just never knew. In the middle of the night, at work, at play, after sex, you name it they came and the first hint of that headache I would take to anacin and sit down and deal with it and at work I put cold towels on my face. It was his chiropractic. I swore I would never see a chiropractor. I used the word never, it bit me. So some 30 years ago I went to a chiropractor. He seemed to think he could help me. I went 3 times a week for a month and blam I woke up one morning and I just had this feeling. I knew they were gone. I had never felt that before. It was the first of many. That's how I knew my cycles were over by the way. I went one year without a headache. I had never gone a year before. Got him again, went back to the chiropractor. Went a year and a half. He suggested instead of doing it this way why don't you come once a month and try to stay in line and see if that helps. Then I went 2 and 2 and a half years. So for chiropractic I would say definitely worth a try if you haven't done it already. Also in that same time a doctor prescribed me Valium and Vicodin. And no not for the headaches. After the Valium I would take a half a Valium after the headache to relax my facial and neck muscles. I would take a half a Vicodin to take care of the residual pain. Vicodin does not treat or help a cluster headache. Do not take Vicodin. My advice. About 20 years ago I was introduced to Verapamil. My blood pressure was borderline high and Doc put me on it saying it was also preventative for the cluster headache. So I gave it a try. 240 milligrams a day. So it seemed like between the chiropractor and the Verapamil my cycles were now going to be 2 years plus without a headache. Two and a half. I did 3 twice that I remember. They pretty well settled out now a day every 2 and 3 quarter years. Don't ask me why. If I had to do something different with the Verapamil I would take half. I would go down to 120, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening and then go back up when they came back. That's pretty much the way you read it in the ClusterHeadache.com how they do it. It's supposed to be a constipator. Never was for me for 15 years. But the last two, owie. It's not just that, it's anything. More about that later. I still remember every one of those cycles I come out of was waking up in the morning and I knew they were gone. I just knew it. That's how they ended. Next thing that came along was Imitrex. Brand new dog had samples. That was about 15 years ago. 17 maybe. What worked best for me was the 20 milligram nasal spray. All I have is injections right now. I've never used one but next ones, yikes. I only used them to take care of the really bad ones that the aspirin wouldn't do. I'd use way more than I should. It says right on the package. Use only 6 per month. I know a lot of people use a lot more and I did myself. They're not good for you. They worked for me about 80% of the time. You want to get rid of the headache so what do you do? The last thing I tried was oxygen. 15 liters per minute. I had to have that special regulator. I can tell you this. I didn't give it a fair shake but I'm telling you right now. It's working for a lot of people. You got to give this one a try. I wasn't able to give it a fair shake. I didn't get my oxygen until 3 weeks into my cycle and it was a bad cycle. Insurance authorization delivery you name it. My advice if you get oxygen and it works, buy your own equipment. Have it on hand always. That's what I'm going to work on. Try it. One thing I'm not going to comment on is mushrooms because I haven't tried them. I have them on hand right now. There's a lot of studies out there. Google it. I'm going to do a separate short video on that and my research there also. As well as the aftermath of what happened this last cycle. My hope is really that I can help one person. Really I'd like to help many. That's my hope. My last four cycles since 2005 have come two and three quarter years apart. I mean to the month. There may be something to do with the season there. I don't know. Kind of weird. They've lasted 17 to 25 days except for the very last one. It lasted 35 days and it was by far the worst cycle ever. My advice if you are diagnosed with them, get yourself the best neurologist you can get and have all the tests, brain scan, whatever they want to do. Back up any medications or treatments they want to give you or start you on with those two websites. Clusterheadaches.com, Clusterbusters and see what the users are saying about it. Very important. I can't stress that enough. Back it up. They don't know enough. Neurologists in our areas. Anyway, if you have any questions or advice for me, please leave me a comment and I will get back to you. Thanks for watching. Hang in there. You can do 40 years too. Peace. Love.",Cluster Headache,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0," 4

The video has clear aims related to sharing the narrator's personal experiences with cluster headaches and various treatments they have tried over 40 years. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront and have to be inferred from the overall content. The narrator discusses websites, medications, oxygen therapy, chiropractic treatment, and potential future videos on specific topics like mushrooms and the aftermath of their last cycle. While informative, the aims could have been more clearly articulated at the beginning for better structure."," 3

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aims of providing information about treatments for cluster headaches. The speaker shares personal experiences with various medications (aspirin, Verapamil, Imitrex), oxygen therapy, and chiropractic treatment. However, the information is anecdotal and lacks depth or specific details that a medical expert might provide. The speaker acknowledges the importance of consulting reliable sources like clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters.org, but does not delve into the scientific evidence or clinical guidelines for different treatment options. Overall, the video offers a personal account of managing cluster headaches, but falls short of comprehensively covering the topic from a medical expert's perspective."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about cluster headaches, including personal experiences, treatments, and advice for managing the condition. It covers various aspects such as medications (e.g., Verapamil, Imitrex), alternative therapies (e.g., chiropractic, oxygen therapy), and resources (websites like clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters). However, some information may be outdated or anecdotal, and it lacks comprehensive medical details or professional recommendations. While the video addresses some questions readers might have, it may not fully satisfy all potential queries about cluster headaches. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially relevant) is appropriate."," 3

Explanation:
The video transcript mentions a few sources of information, but does not consistently provide references for the main claims or statements. The sources mentioned are:

1. clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters websites (referred to as ""a wealth of information"")
2. Alludes to research studies on the use of mushrooms for treating cluster headaches, but does not cite any specific study.

However, for most of the treatments and experiences discussed, such as the use of aspirin, Verapamil, Imitrex, oxygen therapy, and the role of chiropractors, the video does not provide any references to scientific studies or expert opinions that support those claims. The information seems to be based primarily on the author's personal experiences and anecdotal evidence.

Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as the sources of evidence are partially clear, with some references provided but many main claims lacking explicit citations or references to back them up."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some dates or time frames related to the speaker's personal experience with cluster headaches, such as mentioning that they started when he was around 20 years old, and that he was introduced to certain medications like Verapamil and Imitrex around 20 and 15-17 years ago, respectively. However, there are no specific dates provided for any external sources of information used in compiling the video content. The only clear date is the recording/upload date of the video itself. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that while some timeframes are mentioned, there are no clear dates given for the main sources of information used in creating the video."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript presents a personal account of the speaker's experience with cluster headaches and various treatments they have tried over the years. While it is primarily based on the speaker's individual experience, it does reference some external sources of information, such as websites (clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters) and mentions research studies on mushrooms as a potential treatment. However, the information is largely anecdotal and lacks a comprehensive discussion of different treatment options or a balanced representation of their effectiveness and potential risks or side effects. The focus is primarily on the treatments that worked or didn't work for the speaker, without much reference to other possible choices or a broader scientific perspective. Additionally, the tone is conversational and personal, rather than objective or impartial."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some details of additional sources of support and information, specifically mentioning two websites: clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters.org. However, the details provided about these websites are limited, and no other organizations or resources are mentioned. The video primarily focuses on the speaker's personal experiences and recommendations for managing cluster headaches. While the suggested websites are helpful, the lack of comprehensive information about other support sources or organizations warrants a score of 4 (Partially) rather than a perfect 5."," 4

The video partially refers to areas of uncertainty or differences in expert opinion concerning treatment choices for cluster headaches. While the speaker does not explicitly discuss gaps in knowledge or uncertainties, some statements suggest an acknowledgment of the lack of definitive treatments or differences in effectiveness among individuals.

For instance, the speaker mentions trying various treatments, such as chiropractic care, Verapamil, Imitrex, and oxygen therapy, and notes that some worked better than others for him personally. He also advises viewers to research treatments on websites like clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters to see what other users are saying, implying that there may be differing opinions or experiences with treatments.

Additionally, the speaker acknowledges that neurologists in certain areas may not know enough about cluster headaches, suggesting a lack of complete knowledge or consensus among experts regarding the most effective treatments.

However, the video does not provide an in-depth discussion or explicit acknowledgment of the uncertainties or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices, which is why it receives a score of 4 rather than a full 5."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments work, but it lacks comprehensive explanations for most of the treatments mentioned. While the speaker briefly mentions the rationale behind using Verapamil for its preventative effects and the potential mechanism of action for chiropractic treatment, there is no clear description of how other treatments like aspirin, Imitrex, oxygen therapy, or mushrooms work to alleviate or prevent cluster headaches. The transcript is primarily focused on sharing the speaker's personal experiences with various treatments rather than delving into the scientific mechanisms behind them. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as the video only partially addresses the question of how the treatments work."," 3

Explanation:

The video partially describes the benefits of some treatments for cluster headaches. The speaker mentions that aspirin/Anacin helped get rid of the headache, chiropractic treatment helped end cycles for extended periods, Verapamil increased the duration between cycles, and Imitrex nasal spray provided relief for severe headaches about 80% of the time. However, no clear benefits are described for treatments like inderol, Valium, Vicodin, or oxygen therapy. While the speaker recommends trying oxygen therapy based on its reported effectiveness for others, no personal benefits are mentioned. Overall, the video provides some insight into the benefits of certain treatments but lacks details on the benefits for several other treatments discussed."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript partially describes the risks or side effects of some treatments mentioned for cluster headaches. It mentions that Vicodin does not treat or help cluster headaches, implying it should not be taken for that purpose. It also cautions about taking more than the recommended dosage of Imitrex (6 per month), stating ""They're not good for you."" However, the transcript does not explicitly mention risks or side effects for other treatments discussed, such as aspirin/Anacin, inderol, chiropractic treatment, Valium, Verapamil, or oxygen therapy. Therefore, it receives a score of 2, indicating that risks are described for some but not all of the treatments mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment or postponing treatment for cluster headaches. The speaker primarily focuses on sharing their personal experiences with various treatments they have tried, such as aspirin, Verapamil, Imitrex, and oxygen therapy. While they mention briefly considering trying mushrooms as a treatment option, there is no discussion about what would happen if no treatment is used or the consequences of delaying or forgoing treatment altogether. The transcript lacks any explicit information about the risks or benefits of a no treatment approach, warranting a score of 1."," 2

The transcript partially describes the effects of treatment choices on overall quality of life, but the information is incomplete or unclear.

Explanation: The video discusses various treatment options such as aspirin, Verapamil, Imitrex, oxygen therapy, and chiropractic care for managing cluster headaches. However, it does not provide a clear or detailed description of how these treatments affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. While the speaker mentions that some treatments helped reduce the frequency and duration of headache cycles, there is no explicit discussion of their impact on daily functioning, ability to perform activities, or overall well-being. The focus is primarily on the effectiveness of the treatments in managing the headaches themselves, rather than their broader effects on quality of life."," 4 (Partially)

The video provides some information about different treatment options for cluster headaches, including over-the-counter medications (aspirin, Anacin, Excedrin), prescription medications (Verapamil, Imitrex, oxygen therapy), and alternative treatments (chiropractic care). However, the information is not presented in a comprehensive or systematic way, and the video does not clearly outline the specific circumstances or patient profiles that would make one treatment choice more suitable than another.

The video mentions the speaker's personal experiences with different treatments and what worked or didn't work for them, but it does not provide a clear, structured discussion of the potential benefits, risks, or appropriate use cases for each treatment option. There is also no explicit mention of alternative treatments beyond those the speaker tried personally.

While the video acknowledges that there are multiple potential treatment choices, it falls short of providing a clear, detailed description of who is most likely to benefit from each choice and under what circumstances, or suggesting alternatives to investigate further before deciding on a particular treatment."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it primarily focuses on the personal experiences and treatments of the speaker.

The speaker suggests consulting websites like clusterheadaches.com and clusterbusters.org, which could provide information to facilitate discussions with healthcare professionals about treatment options. He also recommends getting the best neurologist possible and backing up any suggested treatments or medications with information from those websites.

However, the video does not explicitly encourage discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals. It mainly describes the various treatments the speaker has tried, such as aspirin, chiropractor visits, Verapamil, Imitrex, and oxygen therapy, and offers advice based on personal experiences.

While the video provides some resources for gathering information, it lacks direct recommendations for engaging in shared decision-making through discussions with others about treatment choices.",set()
Y1K0mQgKceQ,"I want to share with you an experience I had recently with bad medications and good medications concerning cluster headaches. I started getting headaches on August the 4th. I have a new MD. He called in Emmetrex Oral for me. I went and I picked up nine of them that my insurance covered and I was getting headaches every six to eight hours. They didn't last very long. I went back to get more and discovered that they were going to cost me $20 a pill because my insurance wouldn't cover them when I asked the pharmacist why. She said they discovered that sumatriptin causes rebound headaches. I was like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? And so the very thing that's supposed to stop them causes them to rebound. Well anyhow, sumatriptin is the only thing that knocks out headaches for me. I haven't had them in three years and I hadn't heard about the oxygen until recently and I'll talk about that later. So anyhow, I get concerned and I decide to go to my MD. Well I had taken like 20 sumatriptin by the time I get to him and they prescribed for me prednisone and topamax to offset the headaches. Well it did work for two and a half days. I didn't have headaches and then they started again and they were like 16 hours apart and 18 hours apart. And then they got closer and closer together. Well I'm taking sumatriptin again and so I get concerned, I go back in and I meet with my MD and they decide to prescribe for me panelor. Well on the third trip they told me I need to go see a neurologist. I'm like okay, well I schedule an appointment with a neurologist but they gave me the panelor. One pill at night. So I want you to see this. I'm already taking cholesterol medicine. I'm on topamax, prednisone, sumatriptin and now panelor. Five prescription medications going into my body. And I took it that night. The next morning I woke up and it felt like a steamroller had rolled over me. I couldn't even get out of bed hardly. I was 45 minutes late waking up, which I'm an internet marketer. It doesn't matter, I work out of my house. But I still had work to do, you know. Well anyway I got up, got some coffee, started feeling a little bit better and decided to go to the YMCA and work out. Feeling very lethargic though. I went there and it's a weight class that I take for about an hour and I noticed like halfway through the class I started having like these intense hot flashes and I felt like I was off in a dreamy, dreamy, real light headed dream world. Hard to explain. Anyway I finished the class and I knew something just wasn't right. I just did not feel good at all. I had to go to my son-in-law's office, he's a chiropractor, to get an adjustment. He started asking me about the headaches and said, what medicine are you on? Well I had just told him a couple days before some of the medicines I was on and I couldn't remember when he asked me. This time I'm sitting in front of him and it was like my brain was totally shot down. And I had to ask him and he told me all day was like that. It was like I had dementia. I couldn't remember things. I would walk into the kitchen to do something and I would stand there and I'd think, why am I in here? And I couldn't figure it out. I slept for like four hours. Just awful, awful, awful, awful experience with pain lord. It felt like something exploded in my body. Hot flashes and just out in la-la land. Not good at all. So I didn't take it anymore. Well I was supposed to increase the dosage of the Topamax two days later. Actually I wasn't supposed to see the neurologist for about a week. So I increased the dose on the Topamax and the third day of increasing the dose on the Topamax, I didn't even notice. It was like such a subtle thing that happened that it became normal behavior but it was very abnormal. I would notice that I was in my right mind for a while, like ten minutes or so. And I'd be like, oh I'm feeling good. You know the medicine's working. And then I would go through this phase where I'm like, oh my gosh, I am not in my right mind. There's something really wrong with me. And then when I would be in my right mind I would convince myself, do not take that medicine again. It's not working. You're still getting headaches. Oh that's the other thing that happened with the Pamela. After the Pamela, my headaches started like every six hours again. Or they were like 15, 12 hours apart with all craziness. So anyway, I'm in this altered state with the Topamax and I would convince myself don't take it and then I would convince myself to take it. And then after I would take it when I was in my right mind, I'd be like, I can't believe you actually took that. You should go throw that up. And then I would say, no, just leave it in there. It's supposed to work. Extreme anxiety, memory loss. And let me tell you something about the headaches. When I increased the dose of the Topamax, I have never ever had intense cluster headaches like I experienced. They were like freight trains running through my brain. I have never experienced pain like that in my life. And I've had cluster headaches for 25 years. So the intensity of the headaches increased and the medicine wasn't stopping them quick enough. They ramped up even quicker with the Topamax. So anyway, I called the doctor. He said, don't take it anymore. Get off that stuff. Well, I went and met with a neurologist and the neurologist tells me that Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. He said it nicely. He said, you know, MDs, they do the best that they can. But my neurologist is a headache specialist. He's been treating people with headaches for 20 years and he has a lot of cluster headache patients. He said that cluster headaches and migraines are two separate things. Topamax is only, it's like a last resort whenever people have migraines and they're chronic, getting them all the time. And he said to get to the dose of Topamax that it actually takes to help, he said most people can't get through the side effects. But anyway, Topamax should not be prescribed for cluster headaches. That's what he told me. So he's the expert. I'm just sharing that with you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",Cluster Headache,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 3

An8lK5VqNxU,"Hello, my name is Max Edmond and I'm going to share with you today what I do to combat cluster headaches. First of all, Red Bull, I usually drink about a half of one. I take Kudzu root powder as a supplement during the day to help reduce the headaches. When I'm having an attack, I drink half of Red Bull. Any diphenhydramine allergy medicine, this is a Waldro brand. And I also take one BC powder or Goody powder because it has caffeine and it gets to the headache really quick. For the eyes, clear eyes or any Visine will help. Also what's helpful when it's allergy season is a neti pot to clear out the right side. What I normally do is I heat up some rice and I put it into a rice pack and you can tell when it's hot. And then I'll put it in a sock of any sort and I use a funnel to put it in. And then once the rice pack is full, I will rest on a couch or another hard surface and apply the heat to the side of my head that hurts the most. And it's always the right side and I think for most cluster headache sufferers, it is the right side. So this is my advice to you to do this whenever you're having an attack. I usually have one probably about an hour after I take a nap or an hour after I try to go to sleep. And most nights I do sleep on the couch when I'm going through my cycles because on the armrest I can turn my head in this fashion. For some reason it relaxes the side of my neck for the carotid artery where most of the pain comes from and generates from. But most of the pain goes up here to this part of my head. So I have to move my head and apply the pressure in different areas with the rice pack to be able to slow it down. And normally I can get it under control within 15 or 30 minutes. And also if you do not want heat, you can massage the areas and apply pressure to where it hurts the most. But again, one half of any type of Red Bull because of the taurine, one diphenhydramine, usually a 25 milligram, and one BC or goody powder in combination. If you're allergic to any of these, please do not do this. And as a supplement, it cuts the root powder and it will help you get through your cycles faster. Thank you for your time.

uGqN1whhPf4,I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel that familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex or start oxygen treatments. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pang is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take chances and wait to take medicine too late when you feel the familiar pain starting. You must take the medicine right away. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in excruciating pain. Here are the different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumatriptan. Taking the medicine orally. Slowest way to relieve from the pain. A one shot dose in nasal spray form. Two to three times quicker than oral ingestion for relieving pain. Needle injections are very fast for obtaining pain relief.,Cluster Headache,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0," 3

uDwaiY6K-Dc,"I'm doing this video about reasons for severe headaches because my wife has suffered from them ever since I've known her. So in the next minute or so I'll briefly summarize some basics I've learned by reading articles on reputable and reliable resources like these. There are dozens of reasons for severe headaches. I couldn't possibly list them all in one video. So I'll focus here just on the most common. Medical professionals categorize headaches two ways, primary and secondary. Primary headaches include so-called cluster headaches, migraines, tension headaches. You get primary headaches from issues that are not related to illnesses or diseases. Such headaches are triggered by drinking too much alcohol, particularly red wine. Certain foods, especially processed meats containing nitrates. Changes in sleep patterns or lack of sleep. Bad posture. Skipped meals. Stress. Secondary headaches, on the other hand, usually result from some underlying physical disorder. The degree of pain varies greatly with these types. The list of triggers for secondary headaches goes on and on and on. Some are temporary and mild, like dental problems or an ear infection. Some are severe and chronic, ranging from multiple concussions to brain tumors. Naturally, your doctor is your best source of information about the reasons for your severe headaches. Certain prescription or over-the-counter medications often help. I've produced several other videos on related topics. You can find links to those videos below.",Cluster Headache,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 4

ckV6qk27fng,"Cluster Headaches are not migraines. People with cluster headaches experience three to four headaches a day, and these clusters last in periods of two weeks to three months. The headaches can occur like clockwork arriving at almost the same time every day. Men get cluster headaches more than women, and the cause of them is unknown. A cluster headache is always centrally located around the eye. Here are some descriptions of what a cluster headache feels like from people who have experienced them. It's like a burning, hot poker being shoved through your eye while an elephant stands on your temple while someone is punching you in the back of the head and pulling on your hair. Waking out of a sound sleep like somebody hit you in the back of the head with a baseball bat, like my left eyeball is going to explode, crying, moaning, rocking back and forth, praying that it will stop. It feels like my eyeball is in a vise and I have noticed some tautness in the base of my right neck muscles. It's an acute, stabbing pain like a knife behind your eye. It feels like a stabbing pain. I have pain in the jaw, cheek, and neck. The pain is so bad that even touching my hair on my left side hurts. My left sinus cavity is always blocked and I feel I am stuffed up. I've suffered through about 10 episodes of cluster headaches over the past 25 years. Here's the basic nature of my headaches. First I feel a slight burning sensation in my left nostril. There is no other feeling like the burn and it can only be associated with a cluster headache. If you think you are having cluster headaches you must familiarize yourself with what the burn in the nostril feels like in order to be able to take medicine right away. Within a couple of minutes of feeling the burn, a 1-2 second pulsating stab of pain will occur over or behind my left eye. The pulsating pain and the burn start increasing in intensity very quickly. In about 15 minutes my left eye begins to feel as though it is continuously being pinched with tremendous force. My eye begins to stream with tears and my left nostril begins to slightly discharge. If you are to pinch and twist the inside of your arm as hard as you can and then multiply that pain by 3 times, that's what it feels like in the eye. The debilitating pain gradually increases all around the eye and the left side of the head throbs and pulses with stabbing pain as the eye feels like it's being relentlessly pinched. The severe and intense pain doesn't occur in waves but rather it is continuous and it doesn't let up. During a cluster headache attack I cannot move. The only thing I can do is focus on how terrible the pain is. Light sounds and any type of movement are very irritating during these headaches. A cluster headache can last up to an hour and an hour and a half. About medications, Imitrex or Sumitriptan is the only medicine that works. It is vitally important that as soon as you feel the familiar pain in your nostril or eye you must take Imitrex. Cluster headaches always intensify very quickly once the first pain is felt indicating that one is coming on. These headaches are so debilitating that you can never take a chance and wait to take medicine once you feel that familiar pain starting. Within 15 minutes of the first burn in the nostril I've been in an excruciating pain. The only medicine that works effectively for me in stopping the pain or cluster headache is Imitrex. Through the years I've tried Excedrin Migraine, Advil, Tylenol, Aleve, Hydrocodone and several narcotic pain pills. None of them eliminate the pain like Imitrex. I've never found anything over the counter that will stop a cluster headache for up to 8 hours like Imitrex does. Usually over the counter medications take the intense pain away but I am left with an uncomfortable dull ache in the head. Also Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Acetaminophen cause me to have an upset stomach after taking them for a couple of days. Different methods of administering Imitrex or Sumitriptan. Taking the medicine orally. This is the slowest way to get pain relief. A one shot dose of nasal spray. This is about three times quicker than the oral dose. Needle injections are very fast for pain relief.",Cluster Headache,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0," 5

U7NA0p8edn0,"Well, it was about four years ago. We were all in a movie theater. I think we were watching Harry Potter. And I started getting a lot of pain and didn't feel very well. So I left toward the end of the movie and went out to the car. When I got to the car, I had what I would call the worst headache of my life. I thought I was having an aneurysm and it just felt like my head was gonna explode. So they came out from the movie and we went right to the emergency room. And from there, they suggested I see a neurologist. So I reached out to the Jefferson Headache Center and signed up to enter their program. And that was a real turning point for me. I got a good diagnosis there almost immediately. And then I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. Because at that point, I really had no idea. And I was scared. The pain was intense. And it was very difficult to work, very difficult to attend social functions, etc., to do anything really, with the fear of having an attack in the middle of it. So many people with chronic cluster headaches and some with episodic cluster headaches go through a process of having difficulty at work, not having attendance issues, having performance issues because they're struggling through this thing that nobody really understands. And they sort of go through this spiral of losing a job and then taking another job, losing that job, then losing their health insurance. And then they end up with very little. Why do they call these the suicide headaches? Well, because it takes everything away from you. I think it's not so much the pain, although the pain is horrendous. Living in pain is very difficult. Any chronic pain sufferer can tell you that. But the inability to concentrate, to maintain an activity for an extended period of time beyond, say, 20 minutes, those are things that really steal from you your ability to do things day to day. If I'm completely honest, I've thought about it. You've thought about ending it. Yeah, yeah, I have, on a number of occasions. But then I think about my daughters and my wife and what they bring to me and to some degree what I do for them. And that just changes my thinking. There is definitely a way to live and it can be positive. And I think there's always room to have that downtime and that pity party, but at a certain point, that's not fun anymore. And you have to really think about what you can do and that your life's not the same anymore. It's different. And so how do you reform what you're going to do with your life in this new state? And that's kind of what I have done in putting my energy into a support group and that sort of thing, keeping up with the house as much as I'm able to.

Iw7FvRjeDX0,"Is there anyone in the world who has never had a headache? In some cases, you can solve this pesky problem by yourselves. Yet sometimes, you should see a doctor immediately. Therefore, we've put together a detailed guide to help you identify five types of headaches and the best ways to get rid of them. Tension headache. This is the most frequent type of headache in the world. Everyone has experienced it at least once in their life. Here are the main symptoms. Tension headaches often cause a pressure that feels like you're wearing a tight band around your forehead. You might feel severe tension and spasms around your eyes and upper forehead. Also, you feel a dull, gnawing pain. Most often, the intensity of the pain increases from morning to evening. What causes this headache? The main factors that seem to contribute to tension headaches are severe stress, fatigue, poor posture, and holding the head in an improper position for a long time. Chronic tension headaches are rare and often are associated with head or neck injuries. How to get rid of it? You can take any appropriate painkiller, but you should only use them occasionally. If headaches occur frequently and last for a long time, consult your doctor. Also, try to be physically active. Stretch your shoulders and neck regularly, and spend more time outdoors. Sinus headache. This type of headache is caused by sinusitis. It is often accompanied by fever, facial swelling, and tension in the forehead and cheekbone. Here are the main symptoms. You'll feel a deep pressure and pain in your forehead, around the eyebrows, and under the eyes. The pain usually gets stronger when you move your head sharply. This headache might also lead to a running or blocked nose. You might feel tired and weak. Sinus headaches are caused by sinusitis. They are also a common complication after a cold or during a seasonal allergy. Keep in mind that sinus headaches rarely go away on their own. If you have an allergy, antihistamines may help. In other cases, it is best to see a doctor who will most probably prescribe antibiotics. Migraine. A migraine is often associated with a violation of the metabolic processes and a dilation of blood vessels in the brain. A person may also inherit the ability to get a migraine. All symptoms of this severe headache occur during a migraine attack that progresses through four main stages. The first is prodrome. It lasts for one to two days. You feel irritable, fatigued, and have an increased or decreased appetite. The second stage, aura. It usually lasts up to 30 minutes. You become sensitive to light, feel tingling and numbness, and might have speech disorders. The third one, resolution, might last up to 24 hours. You feel fatigued and have trouble concentrating on daily tasks. The last stage, the headache itself, might last up to 72 hours, during which you feel severe, throbbing pain. Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines. Although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms, you need to see your doctor to choose the right one. Moreover, regular exercise will help you improve your health significantly. Cluster headache. Cluster headaches are rare, affecting less than 1% of the population. They are five times more common in males than females. It's hardly possible to confuse this headache with another one. A cluster headache may cause a stabbing pain behind or around your eyes, usually on one side of your head. It frequently develops during sleep. The pain usually lasts from 15 minutes to 1 hour. Symptoms might include redness of the eyes, sensitivity to light, and lacrimation. Scientists don't know exactly what causes cluster headaches. These headaches are most often linked to disruptions in the body's biological clock. Treating it can be tricky, because the pain appears and disappears spontaneously and at a moment's notice. Only a doctor can help you solve this problem. Hangover. We hear many versions of why people often have a headache after drinking alcohol. One of them suggests that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels in your body. Moreover, alcohol promotes water loss and dehydration that are major migraine triggers. The main symptoms are throbbing or dull aching pain, tightness, heaviness. The best remedy is to take a painkiller, drink plenty of water, and get some good sleep. Take a hangover seriously. If you have a headache after consuming even a small amount of alcohol, it may indicate that you're suffering from a mild form of migraine. We hope you never experience any of these headaches. But if you get one of them, it's better to consult a doctor before taking any medication. Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire. Thanks for watching!

The video clearly outlines its aims from the very beginning - to provide a detailed guide on identifying and addressing five different types of headaches (tension headache, sinus headache, migraine, cluster headache, and hangover headache). The introduction sets up this purpose, and the subsequent sections methodically cover the symptoms, causes, and remedies for each type of headache mentioned. The aims of educating the viewer on recognizing and managing these common headache types are transparently conveyed throughout the transcript."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of different types of headaches, their symptoms, causes, and potential treatments. It covers tension headaches, sinus headaches, migraines, cluster headaches, and hangover headaches in detail. However, it does not delve deeply into the specific aims or goals outlined for the video. While it achieves the general goal of educating viewers about headaches, it lacks clarity on whether it fully meets the specific objectives it set out to accomplish. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially) is appropriate, as most of the expected information is provided, but the achievement of the stated aims is not explicitly addressed."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about different types of headaches, their symptoms, causes, and potential treatments. It covers common headaches such as tension headaches, sinus headaches, migraines, cluster headaches, and hangovers. The information is detailed and could help viewers understand and identify the type of headache they might be experiencing.

However, the transcript lacks some depth in terms of providing specific medical advice or treatment recommendations from a professional. It encourages consulting a doctor for certain types of headaches, but does not provide comprehensive medical guidance. Additionally, some sections, such as the introduction and closing remarks, are not directly relevant to the topic of headaches.

Overall, the information is largely relevant and could be helpful for readers seeking a general understanding of different types of headaches, but it may not be sufficient for those seeking specific medical advice or treatment plans."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially provides sources of evidence for the information presented. While it does not explicitly cite specific research studies or expert opinions, it does mention some general sources for certain claims. For example, it states that scientists don't know the exact cause of cluster headaches but links them to disruptions in the body's biological clock. It also mentions that migraines are associated with metabolic processes and dilation of blood vessels in the brain, and that they may be inherited. However, for many of the other statements and details provided, such as the symptoms of different types of headaches or suggested remedies, the sources of information are not explicitly stated. Therefore, the video can be considered to provide sources of evidence to some extent, warranting a partial score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides the date or time period for the video itself by mentioning that it is a ""YouTube video"". However, it does not mention any specific dates or time periods for the sources of information used to compile the content in the video. The lack of dates for the acknowledged sources makes it unclear when the information was produced or how current it is. Therefore, I have given a score of 2, indicating that only the date of the video itself is clear, but not the dates for the acknowledged sources."," 4

Explanation: The video provides a balanced overview of different types of headaches, their causes, symptoms, and potential treatments. It mentions multiple sources of information, including research on the contributing factors and inheritance patterns of migraines. However, there are a few instances where the video leans towards a personal perspective or lacks nuance. For example, it states ""Unfortunately, there's no cure for migraines"" without acknowledging the ongoing research and potential future treatments. Additionally, some advice, like ""Do not self-medicate because the consequences can be dire,"" is presented in a slightly alarmist manner without providing context or exceptions. Overall, the video is largely objective and informative, but it could be more balanced in certain areas."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some details about seeking medical advice for certain types of headaches, such as migraines, cluster headaches, and sinus headaches. However, it does not provide specific details or recommendations for additional sources of support or information beyond consulting a doctor. The information provided is limited to the local organization (the YouTube channel ""Bright Side"") and does not include external organizations or resources for further reading or support on headache management. Therefore, the score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as the video provides incomplete details about additional sources of information or support."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some discussion of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for different types of headaches, but the information is not comprehensive or clear. For tension headaches, it mentions consulting a doctor if they occur frequently, but does not discuss specific treatment choices or uncertainties. For sinus headaches, it suggests seeing a doctor who will likely prescribe antibiotics, but does not mention other treatment options or uncertainties. For migraines, it acknowledges that there is no cure and that a doctor needs to be consulted to choose the right treatment, implying some uncertainty. However, it does not provide further details on the treatment choices or areas of uncertainty. For cluster headaches, it states that treating them can be tricky and that only a doctor can help, but does not elaborate on the treatment options or uncertainties. Overall, while the video acknowledges the need to consult a doctor and that treatment choices may vary, it does not provide a clear or detailed discussion of the gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning treatment choices for the various types of headaches."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments work, but it lacks comprehensive explanations for all the treatments mentioned. For tension headaches, it suggests taking painkillers occasionally but does not explain how they work. For sinus headaches, it mentions that antihistamines may help for allergies, and antibiotics are prescribed, but does not explain their mechanisms of action. For migraines, it states that there is no cure, but various treatments are available to ease symptoms, without elaborating on how they work. For cluster headaches, it does not provide any explanation for potential treatments. The hangover section briefly mentions that alcohol causes blood vessel dilation and affects serotonin levels, but does not explain how remedies like painkillers, water, and sleep help alleviate the headache. Overall, while some mechanisms are touched upon, the descriptions are often incomplete or missing for many of the treatments discussed."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments for the different types of headaches. For tension headaches, it suggests taking occasional painkillers, being physically active, and stretching. For sinus headaches caused by allergies, it mentions antihistamines may help, while for non-allergic cases, it recommends seeing a doctor who will likely prescribe antibiotics. For migraines, it states that there is no cure but various treatments are available to ease symptoms, and regular exercise can help improve overall health. However, it does not explicitly describe benefits for the treatments of cluster headaches or hangovers, beyond suggesting consulting a doctor for cluster headaches and taking painkillers, drinking water, and sleeping for hangovers."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with some of the treatments mentioned for different types of headaches. For tension headaches, it warns against frequent use of painkillers. For sinus headaches caused by allergies, it mentions that antihistamines may help, implying potential side effects. It also states that antibiotics are often prescribed for non-allergy sinus headaches, which can have side effects. However, no risks or side effects are explicitly mentioned for the treatments suggested for migraines or cluster headaches. The transcript focuses more on describing the symptoms and potential causes of each type of headache rather than comprehensively discussing the risks of various treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for different types of headaches. It mentions that chronic tension headaches ""rarely go away on their own"" and that sinus headaches ""rarely go away on their own"" if caused by sinusitis or a cold, implying that treatment may be necessary. However, it does not explicitly discuss the risks or benefits of foregoing treatment altogether. For migraines, it states that ""there's no cure"" but that treatments are available to ease symptoms, suggesting that not receiving treatment would allow symptoms to persist. Overall, while some potential consequences of not treating certain headaches are mentioned, the information provided is incomplete and lacks a clear, comprehensive discussion of the risks and benefits of forgoing treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life. It provides some information on how certain treatments, such as taking painkillers or seeking medical attention, can help alleviate the symptoms of different types of headaches. However, it does not explicitly discuss the impacts of these treatments on day-to-day activities or overall quality of life. The information provided is focused more on identifying the types of headaches and their potential causes, rather than the effects of the treatments on daily functioning."," 4

The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for different types of headaches. It provides some information on who might benefit from certain treatments and under what circumstances, but the suggestions are generally broad and not comprehensive.

For tension headaches, it mentions taking occasional painkillers and trying physical activity/stretching, but does not discuss alternative treatment options or who might benefit more from one approach over another. For sinus headaches, it suggests antihistamines for allergies and antibiotics for other cases, but does not explore other potential treatments or specific circumstances where one might be preferred. For migraines, it states there is no cure but treatments are available to ease symptoms, recommending seeing a doctor to choose the right one, without detailing the various treatment options. For cluster headaches, it simply states that only a doctor can help solve the problem, without mentioning potential treatments. The hangover section does not discuss treatment choices.

While the video acknowledges that different headache types may require different treatments and consulting a doctor is advisable, it lacks comprehensive details on the range of treatment options, their suitability for different circumstances, and guidance on how to evaluate an"," 3

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited.

OO5oDaG45kE,"The following report contains some disturbing images. It is one of the most painful experiences that a human can endure. It feels as though somebody is grabbing your inside of your face and pulling as far out and as far wide as they can. Difficult to watch, often unbearable to experience. The pain of a cluster headache can be indescribable. Some sufferers post videos showing an attack to try and convey the reality. We're using these with their permission. Scott has suffered them for 10 years. He helps run a support group, Ouch! UK. I have knocked myself out on various occasions. Because of the pain, I will find something very, very hard to strike my head against. Because you're driven, it's a primeval driver to stop the pain. Cluster headaches baffle doctors. Far more intense than a migraine, many sufferers, like Rachel, experience them when seasons change. I will get mine every spring and every autumn without fail. Rachel's volunteered for a new research project taking place at King's College Hospital in south London. We're looking to see what happens in the brain during the attacks compared to when there is no attack. Around 40 sufferers will have their brains scanned. This is the posterior hypothalamus and it's also known as the internal body clock. We think that is linked with the cluster headache attacks. They tend to have more cluster attacks around spring and autumn. We don't quite understand the reason behind that. This will be an ambitious, at times arduous project. Volunteers will also be having their brains scanned whilst an attack is taking place. Unless people put themselves forward to things like this, we're never going to know any more about cluster headaches. It's estimated there are around 130,000 sufferers in the UK, possibly more as the condition is often misdiagnosed. This patient, who's asked to remain anonymous, is being injected with steroids and an anaesthetic, a preventative measure that can help but is only effective for a few weeks. We're supposed to damp down the activity of the nerves, hence give some relief to these patients. It's hoped this device, which would be implanted inside a patient's head, could offer long-term help. The way it does is by delivering some electricity around the nerve and damping down the hyperactivity, the excessive activation of the nerves, which is firing without any control. Trials are going well. The team at Guy's in St Thomas' Hospital hope to make it available within a year, a long-awaited step forward for sufferers of this distressing condition.

9F_FpZB5LWU,"My name is Jenny McLaren and this is my cluster headache awareness project. Have you ever had a headache? Of course you have. Who hasn't? Have you ever heard of a suicide headache? There is a medical condition called cluster headache. Researchers have nicknamed it the suicide headache. Cluster headache is the worst pain known to medical science. Here are some sources to validate if you don't take my word for it. HealthBean.com, News.Discovery.com, Alearned.com, NHS.UK, Dr. Peter Godesby and Dr. Todd Rosen. In fact, Google the worst pain known to medical science. A list of cluster headache sites will appear. The pain of a cluster headache attack is said to far surpass that of a migraine headache. Some patients experience both cluster headache attacks and migraine attacks. Some patients describe the pain as worse than childbirth. The first time a sufferer experiences an attack, the result is frightening. Many think they are dying or experiencing a brain tumor. Here are some quotes from patients about their first attack. I was 20 years old and didn't even know pain like that existed. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going to die. I dialed 911 because I thought my brain was bleeding. Thought I was having a brain aneurysm, bloody terrified. I thought I was dying from an aneurysm and had a panic attack. It felt like demons had burrowed into my head. Proper diagnosis is often difficult to obtain and finding the right treatment is frustrating. Here are some more quotes from patients. I went to the ER and they didn't know what was wrong with me. 59 daily attacks and 6 doctors later, I was finally diagnosed. It took 11 years for my diagnosis. I had cluster headache episodes every 18 months and about my fourth episode, I was diagnosed. The pain induced by a cluster headache attack is so intense, in some cases, even morphine is not enough. Cluster headaches come in cycles. The average is 8 to 12 weeks. However, some cycles have been known to last over a year. During an active cycle, a cluster headache patient can experience up to 8 attacks per day. Each attack lasts between 20 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks are often followed by a dull lingering pain known as the residual headache. During each attack, the patient suffers an immense amount of ongoing, immobilizing pain to one side of the head and behind the eye. While attacks are often clockwork, they come without warning. The frequency and intensity of attacks increases as the cycle progresses. Often times, the sufferer is struck down without a warning. Cycles are vicious and subject to change at any time. Patients live in constant fear that at any moment, they could instantly be struck with the most excruciating pain known to man. Cluster headaches never stop. When a cycle ends, the patient enters a remission period, a pain-free period between cycles, only to await the next impending cycle. Some patients don't get a remission period. Episodic cluster headaches are diagnosed when the patient experiences 1 to 8 attacks daily for weeks on end followed by a remission period. Chronic cluster headaches are diagnosed when a patient experiences multiple attacks for a year or longer with little or no pain-free periods. Chronic patients may have high cycles and low cycles where the frequency and intensity of their attacks fluctuate. Doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to their patients. But the pain never goes away. Tryptons are a cluster headache patient's best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Tryptons stop the pain almost immediately after consumption. However, the number of attacks a patient has surpasses the allowed amount of tryptons per month per the FDA. Tryptons can actually prolong a cycle and tolerance to them builds quickly. Treatment is trial and error. There is no cure for cluster headache. There is not a universal treatment that works for every patient. Each cycle is unique to the sufferer. Cluster headache patients have no escape. They often contemplate extreme measures to find relief during an attack, even though relief is an unrealistic expectation during attacks. Continuous treatment failure has led to many cluster headache patients to trial and error of their own with illegal substances just to escape the pain. An anonymous survey revealed many sufferers find relief with hallucinogens and marijuana. Medications only shadow the invading pain temporarily. My name is Jenny McLaren. I am a cluster headache patient. I am a graduate student dedicated to researching and raising awareness of cluster headaches and their effects on patients. Distraction is the best coping mechanism to handle the pain. Here are some coping mechanisms I have used to handle the pain of an attack. Pacing, rocking back and forth, squeezing my hands together tightly, ripping toilet paper rolls to shreds, digging my fingernails into the sides of my arms, applying ice packs, squeezing a stress ball, crying, laying on the kitchen floor rolling from side to side. Here is a list of the treatments my doctors have tried. Maxalt MLT 5 and 10 milligram, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet. Cluster headache is an invisible chronic illness. Living with an invisible disease means appearing fine to other people on the outside while actually living in fear and pain. This causes a negative stigma about you which can lead to strains on relationships. This is one reason cluster headache patients are at a higher risk for anxiety, depression, panic attacks than their pain-free counterparts. Between 2005 and 2009, a study was conducted to investigate whether cluster headache was a risk factor for depression. A group of cluster headache patients were monitored along with two other groups, migraine sufferers and patients free from cluster headaches or migraines. The results of the study showed that cluster headache patients had a significantly higher risk for depression than the other two cohorts. 1,134 individuals completed the survey. Suicidal ideations were substantial occurring in 55% of patients. The same survey explored the personal burden of cluster headaches. 20% of cluster headache patients have lost a job secondary to cluster headache while another 8% are out of work or on disability secondary to their headaches. Cluster headache patients are more susceptible to a wide range of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders and adjustment disorders than their pain-free counterparts. While cluster headaches induce feelings of hopelessness, everyone can help by spreading awareness and educating others about cluster headaches. Sometimes even to live is an act of courage. We can fight the fear of impending attacks together through advocacy and support. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me?",Cluster Headache,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0," 5

However, it lacks clear descriptions of how the various treatments mentioned (e.g., triptans, preventative medications, abortive medications, painkillers) work to alleviate or prevent cluster headaches. While it mentions that triptans can stop the pain almost immediately, it does not explain the mechanism by which they achieve this effect. Similarly, the other treatments are listed without any details on how they act on the body to provide relief or prevent attacks. The transcript focuses more on raising awareness about the condition itself rather than delving into the specifics of how different treatments work."," 2

The video transcript describes the excruciating pain and debilitating effects of cluster headaches, but it does not provide a clear explanation of the benefits of the various treatments mentioned. While it lists some medications prescribed by doctors, such as triptans, preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers, it does not outline the specific benefits of each treatment in terms of controlling symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition, both in the short and long term. The transcript focuses more on the challenges of finding effective treatments and the overall impact of cluster headaches on patients' lives."," 2

The video provides some information about the risks and side effects associated with certain treatments for cluster headaches, but does not comprehensively describe the risks for each treatment mentioned.

It notes that triptans, while effective for aborting attacks, have limits on the allowed number per month due to FDA regulations, can prolong cycles, and patients can build tolerance to them quickly. It also mentions that medications like triptans only provide temporary relief and ""shadow the invading pain.""

However, for the other treatments listed like Maxalt, Fioricet, Dexamethasone, Tramadol, Scalaxone, Naproxen, Topamax, and Percocet, no specific risks or side effects are described. The video focuses more on the general challenges of finding effective treatment through trial and error.

So while some risks are highlighted for triptans, a comprehensive overview of risks for each mentioned treatment is lacking, warranting a partial score of 2."," 2

The video transcript provides some information about the risks and consequences of not treating cluster headaches, but it does not explicitly describe what would happen if no treatment is used or if treatment is postponed or forgone permanently. The transcript discusses the severe and debilitating nature of cluster headache attacks, including the intense pain, frequency of attacks during cycles, and the lack of a cure or universal treatment. It also mentions the negative impact on mental health, relationships, and employment. However, it does not directly compare these risks and consequences to scenarios where treatment is withheld or delayed. The information about the risks of not treating cluster headaches is present but incomplete and not clearly contrasted against treatment options."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not contain any clear reference to the overall quality of life or the effects of treatment choices on day-to-day activities for cluster headache patients. The transcript primarily focuses on describing the severe pain and symptoms associated with cluster headaches, the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment, and the psychological impact of the condition. While it mentions various treatment options like triptans, preventative medications, and painkillers, it does not provide information on how these treatments affect the patients' overall quality of life or their ability to perform daily activities. The transcript lacks specific details regarding the impact of different treatment choices on the patients' functional status or general well-being."," 4

The video provides some information suggesting there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches, but the details are somewhat limited. It mentions that doctors prescribe preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers, and that triptans can provide relief but have limitations. However, it does not go into much depth describing who might benefit most from each option or under what specific circumstances alternatives should be considered. The focus is more on highlighting the severity of cluster headaches and the challenges in finding effective treatment. While choice of treatment is alluded to, fleshing out the decision factors and comparing options could have made the availability of choices clearer."," 3

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making by highlighting the importance of discussing treatment options and experiences with doctors. It mentions that doctors prescribe various preventative medications, abortive medications, and painkillers to patients, and that treatment is often a trial-and-error process as there is no universal treatment that works for everyone. However, the transcript does not directly encourage or suggest discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or other health professionals beyond mentioning interactions with doctors. It primarily focuses on raising awareness about the severity and impact of cluster headaches from the patient's perspective.",set()
bSeYYXlH1MQ,"""Hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches?"" Your nose will start running, hurting,and sneezing. Capsaicin is the burning component of hot peppers. Why would you do such an experiment? Anyone who's handled the compound in the lab knows that if it gets up your nose it causes an intense burning sensation, however this phenomenon has not been formally investigated. Therefore it appeared worthwhile to study the effects produced by the topical application of capsaicin in the human nose. It therefore appeared worthwhile because it had never been done before? OK... So they took some medical students dripped some in their nose and they started sneezing, burning, and snotting. Describing the pain as like 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. No surprise, but here's the interesting part. What do you think happened when they repeated the experiment the next day? You'd think they might be sensitized to it, still all irritated and so it might hurt even worse, but no, it hurt less. Then they did it again the next day and the next. By day 5 it hardly hurt at all, they didn't even get a runny nose, no sneezing. Came back the next week, day ten and still nothing. Sheesh, were they like permanently numbed? No, after a month or so the desensitization wore off and they were back in agony whenever they tried rubbing it in their nose. What the researchers think is happening is that the pain fibers, the nerves that carry pain sensation, dumped so much of the pain neurotransmitter called substance P that they ran out. Day after day of this the nerves had exhausted their stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they made more substance P from scratch, which takes a couple of weeks. This gave researchers an idea. There's a rare headache syndrome called cluster headache. It has been described as one of the worst pains humans experience. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful. It's nicknamed the ""suicide headache"" because patients often consider taking or have taken their lives over it. It's thought to be caused by arterial dilation putting pressure on the trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve blocks to botox to surgery. But hey, that same nerve goes down to the nose. What if we cause the whole nerve to dump all its substance P? ""Preventative effect of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache"". Same as before, capsaicin in the nose and by day 5 they could hardly feel it any more. Note though that these were cluster headache sufferers and so what was rated as an 8 or 9 on the pain scale by the whimpy medical students was like, maybe a 3 or 4 by those used to the violence of the cluster headache attacks. Having achieved desensitization, what happened to their headaches? Well cluster headaches are one-sided headaches, you only get pain on one side of your head. So those who had rubbed capsaicin in the opposite nostril, on the wrong side of the head, nothing happened. They started out having like 40 attacks a day and a month later the headaches were still going strong, but those that rubbed the capsaisin in the nostril on the side of the head where the headaches were, cut the average number of attacks in half. And in fact half the patients were cured! The cluster headaches were gone completely. All in all 80% responded, at least equal if not better than all the current therapies out there.",Cluster Headache,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0," 5

The aims of the video are clear. The transcript starts by posing a question ""Hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches?"" and then proceeds to explain an experiment where capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot) was applied intranasally. It describes how repeated applications led to desensitization of pain fibers due to depletion of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling. The video then connects this phenomenon to cluster headaches, a severely painful condition, and discusses a study where intranasal capsaicin was used to treat cluster headaches, leading to a reduction or complete resolution of headache attacks in a significant proportion of patients. Throughout the transcript, the aim of exploring the potential use of intranasal capsaicin for treating cluster headaches is clearly established and explained."," 5

The video provides a comprehensive explanation of how capsaicin, the burning compound found in hot peppers, can be used as a treatment for cluster headaches. It covers the initial experiments conducted on medical students to study the desensitizing effects of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin. The video then explains the rationale behind using this approach to treat cluster headaches, a rare but extremely painful condition, by inducing the trigeminal nerve to deplete its substance P stores. The results of the clinical trial, where patients experienced a significant reduction or complete elimination of cluster headache attacks, are clearly outlined. The video effectively achieves its aim of explaining this novel treatment approach and its scientific basis."," 5

The video transcript is highly relevant and addresses questions that readers might ask about using capsaicin (the active compound in hot peppers) as a potential treatment for cluster headaches. The transcript provides a detailed explanation of the research process, including the initial experiments on medical students to understand the desensitizing effect of capsaicin on pain fibers, and the subsequent clinical trial on cluster headache patients. It also explains the rationale behind using capsaicin to target the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to be involved in cluster headaches. The results of the clinical trial are clearly presented, showing that applying capsaicin to the affected nostril significantly reduced or eliminated cluster headache attacks in a majority of patients. Overall, the transcript provides comprehensive and relevant information on this novel approach to treating cluster headaches."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some references to the sources of information used, such as mentioning the researchers and the study ""Preventative effect of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache"". However, it does not explicitly cite or reference all the claims made, such as the description of cluster headaches as ""one of the worst pains humans experience"" or the details about the medical students' experiences with capsaicin in their noses. While some key sources are mentioned, the video could be more comprehensive in referencing the evidence for all major statements. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially) is appropriate, as the sources of evidence are clear to some extent but not comprehensively provided for every claim."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details about the sources of information used, but specific dates are not given for all acknowledged sources. The only date mentioned is ""after a month or so the desensitization wore off,"" referring to the desensitization effect of capsaicin on the pain fibers. However, no dates are provided for the primary sources of information, such as the research studies or publications cited in the video. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that while the date of the video itself may be clear, dates for the acknowledged sources have not been fully provided."," 4

Explanation: The video presents information about a potential treatment for cluster headaches using capsaicin in a relatively balanced manner. It discusses the research process, the findings, and the potential implications for treating cluster headaches. However, there are a few aspects that could be considered biased or unbalanced:

1. The video primarily focuses on the positive effects of capsaicin treatment without extensively discussing potential drawbacks, side effects, or limitations.
2. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing treatments for cluster headaches, making it difficult to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages.
3. While it mentions some research studies, it does not provide a broad range of sources or experts, relying heavily on a single line of research.

Overall, the video presents potentially promising information about a novel treatment approach, but it could benefit from a more balanced discussion of alternative treatments, potential drawbacks, and a broader range of expert opinions or research sources."," 1

The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to cluster headaches or the use of capsaicin as a treatment. The video focuses solely on describing the research study involving capsaicin and its potential effects on cluster headaches. While it mentions that cluster headaches are a rare and severe condition, it does not suggest any further reading materials or organizations that could provide more advice or information on the topic."," 5

The transcript clearly discusses areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. It mentions that cluster headaches are described as ""one of the worst pains humans experience"" and that ""few, if any, medical disorders are more painful."" The transcript then goes on to discuss the current treatments for cluster headaches, such as nerve blocks, botox, and surgery, implying that these treatments are not entirely effective or satisfactory. The researchers then explore an alternative treatment using capsaicin, which is presented as a novel approach that has not been formally investigated before. The results of the capsaicin treatment are discussed, including the uncertainty around why it works and the fact that it was not effective for all patients. Overall, the transcript highlights the gaps in knowledge and differences in expert opinion concerning treatment choices for this debilitating condition."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how the capsaicin treatment works to alleviate cluster headaches. It explains that repeated application of capsaicin in the nose leads to the depletion of substance P, a pain neurotransmitter, in the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headaches. This desensitization of the nerve leads to a reduction or elimination of the headache attacks. However, the transcript does not provide details on the specific mechanisms by which substance P depletion or trigeminal nerve desensitization achieves this effect. Additionally, no explanations are provided for how other mentioned treatments, such as nerve blocks, botox, or surgery, work to treat cluster headaches."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the hot sauce/capsaicin treatment for cluster headaches. It mentions that for those who applied capsaicin to the nostril on the same side as their cluster headaches, there was a reduction in the number of attacks, with half of the patients being cured completely. However, it does not explicitly describe the benefits of the other treatments mentioned, such as nerve blocks, botox, or surgery. Therefore, while it covers the benefits of the capsaicin treatment, it does not describe the benefits of each treatment mentioned."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or side effects of the capsaicin treatment for cluster headaches. It mentions that initially, applying capsaicin in the nose caused intense burning, pain, runny nose, and sneezing, which were rated as 8 or 9 out of 10 on the pain scale by medical students. However, it does not explicitly discuss any potential long-term risks or complications of this treatment. The focus is primarily on the desensitization effect and the potential benefits for treating cluster headaches. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as it only covers the short-term side effects for some participants and not the risks for the actual treatment being proposed."," 5

The transcript clearly describes the benefits of not using treatment (i.e., watchful waiting or forgoing treatment) for cluster headaches. It explains that when patients with cluster headaches did not apply the capsaicin nasal treatment, they continued to experience severe headache attacks, with some patients reporting up to 40 attacks per day. This highlights the risk of not using the capsaicin treatment, as the debilitating headaches persist without intervention. On the other hand, the transcript also outlines the benefits of using the capsaicin nasal treatment, stating that it reduced the average number of attacks by half and completely cured the headaches in half of the patients. Therefore, the transcript provides a clear description of both the risks and benefits associated with the ""no treatment"" option for cluster headaches."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choice of using capsaicin nasal applications affects the overall quality of life for cluster headache patients. It mentions that the treatment cut the average number of attacks in half and cured half of the patients completely, suggesting an improvement in their quality of life. However, it does not provide a clear and detailed description of how the reduction or elimination of cluster headaches impacts the patients' day-to-day activities or overall functioning. The information provided is somewhat limited in terms of explicitly addressing the effect on overall quality of life."," 5

The video clearly presents capsaicin nasal application as an alternative treatment choice for cluster headaches, alongside existing treatments like nerve blocks, botox, and surgery. It describes in detail how repeated nasal applications of capsaicin can desensitize the trigeminal nerve and potentially reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks. The video also distinguishes between those who applied capsaicin on the affected side, which showed significant improvement, and those who applied it on the opposite side, which had no effect. This suggests that the treatment choice may be suitable for those experiencing cluster headaches on a particular side of the head. Overall, the video effectively portrays capsaicin nasal application as a potential treatment option worth considering, while highlighting its effectiveness compared to current therapies."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. While it does not explicitly suggest discussing with doctors or loved ones, it presents an alternative treatment option (using capsaicin nasal applications) and discusses its potential benefits and side effects. This information could facilitate a conversation with healthcare providers about considering this approach as part of a shared decision-making process. However, the video does not directly recommend or emphasize the importance of shared decision-making, hence the score of 4 instead of 5.",set()
WAF_YT6PaCI,"Health Watch. Cluster headaches usually come on quickly and then come back again and again for days. And sufferers say the pain is so intense it's almost unbearable. Health Watch reporter Beth Galvin is here now with more. Beth. And Wes and Lisa, these kind of headaches get their name because they tend to strike in clusters. And during these cycles called cluster periods, the headaches can hit every day, sometimes several times a day. There is no cure, but there are some treatments that can help offer some relief. It really feels like someone stabbing a hot poker through your eye. I tell people like an elephant standing on your temple as well. For 31-year-old Justin Ott, describing what it's like to suffer from cluster headaches is enough to make him cringe. I will get them every single day, multiple times a day, if I don't take medication. Unfortunately, I take medication that sets them back a bit so I only get groups of clusters throughout the year. These attacks happen in a cluster and may last from weeks to months. Patterns of clusters vary from person to person, but most people have at least one or two cluster periods a year. Hi Justin, how are you? Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you. Cluster headaches are the most debilitating of the disorders. It's also dubbed suicide headache because of its severity. The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown and there is not currently a cure. Doctors like Susan Broner of the Headache Institute at Roosevelt Hospital prescribe medications to help decrease the severity of the pain and shorten the headache cycle. Unfortunately, the medications don't stop it 100%, but they help me live my life. Fortunately for Justin and other cluster headache patients, oxygen therapy is an alternative that is successful and has no side effects. In a recently published study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that this treatment is actually more favorable than once thought. Results were that 78% of people with cluster headache responded to high flow oxygen. They were headache free within 15 minutes of using the oxygen. And that was compared to their placebo which was air, high flow air, in which only 20% of people responded. So there was a marked difference between the placebo and the treatment of high flow oxygen. Dr. Broner hopes to see more studies done to show just how this therapy works, but in the meantime, she's happy to see some of her patients pain free. I found oxygen to be the best abortive for me. When I'm home, I can take the oxygen, watch TV, just sitting there, and it's safe. And there's no side effects. And in rare cases, surgery is recommended for cluster headache sufferers who just do not respond to treatments like oxygen therapy or medication. If you're having headaches that disrupt your daily life, you may want to see your doctor so that the two of you, Russ and Lisa, can kind of get to the bottom of what's causing these headaches, what they are, and how best to treat your headaches.

9mQSO4Tzbwk,"The choice is very simple for me. Suicide or psychedelics. Dan suffers from one of the most painful afflictions known to humankind, cluster headaches. The headaches afflict around one in a thousand people and men are more prone than women. These can't be compared with a headache or a head attack. The cause of the condition remains unknown. Oxygen can sometimes abort the attacks, but if that fails, sufferers face a bout of excruciating pain that can last for up to three hours. It feels like a hot dagger is being poked through one's eye all the way through one's brain. It's just devastating to see someone in that much pain and there's nothing that I can do for him. There was one occasion that I was laying in bed knowing that I was going to end it. And I was trying to picture the last time I saw my kids. And that was a bad day. I was trying to figure out what I was going to wear when I put a bullet in my head. That was a bad day. With Dan on the verge of suicide and the family in crisis, Leanne made a life-saving discovery. I read on one of the cluster headache sites about people using mushrooms. And at first I thought it was really kind of strange, but at that point nothing else seemed to be working, so I thought it was worth giving it a try. It was the best medicine we ever found. This natural fungi contains powerful psychoactive compounds and has been inducing mind-bending psychedelic trips in users for thousands of years. Unwilling to buy from illicit drug dealers, Dan grows his own magic mushrooms. Here's the medicine chest where the magic happens. Dan has to grow his magic mushrooms in the right environment. I've got to keep the humidity at 99%. Keep the temperature at 75 degrees and fall off. There are mushrooms. Once I pick the mushrooms, I bring them in here, put them under a ceiling fan, let them air dry for 24 hours. Once they're cracker dried, they're good for storage for a year or two. Best two years of pain-free living right there. It's homegrown. Some people have the stomach to just take them like that. But capsules, it's better on the stomach and a lot easier on nausea and easier to get down. He had lost his passion for all of the things that he used to love. And if you say, my dad's taking mushrooms to save his life, a majority would just say, that's ridiculous. They wouldn't believe it.

However, it lacks a comprehensive discussion of other treatment options, potential risks or side effects of using psychedelics, and does not provide a broader scientific or medical perspective from experts in the field. The tone is somewhat sensational and emotive, portraying psychedelic mushrooms as a miraculous cure without acknowledging potential drawbacks or alternative treatments. While it highlights an interesting case study, the video lacks balance and objectivity in presenting a range of viewpoints and evidence from multiple sources."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to cluster headaches or the use of psychedelics for treating the condition. The transcript focuses solely on the personal story of Dan, a cluster headache sufferer who grows and consumes magic mushrooms to alleviate his symptoms. While it mentions online forums where Dan's wife initially learned about using mushrooms, it does not provide specific website links or names of organizations that could offer further information or support. The video appears to be purely anecdotal and does not suggest any additional resources for viewers seeking more details on the topic."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for cluster headaches. It highlights the lack of a known cause for the condition and the ineffectiveness of traditional treatments like oxygen therapy in providing relief from the excruciating pain. The transcript then introduces the use of psychedelic mushrooms as an alternative treatment, which is described as a ""life-saving discovery"" for the patient, Dan. However, it also acknowledges the unconventional and controversial nature of this treatment choice, mentioning that most people would find it ""ridiculous"" to use illegal drugs like mushrooms for medical purposes. Overall, the transcript provides a balanced discussion of the uncertainty surrounding treatment options for cluster headaches, presenting psychedelic mushrooms as an effective but unconventional choice in the absence of other reliable treatments."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details on how psychedelic mushrooms help treat Dan's cluster headaches, mentioning that they contain powerful psychoactive compounds that induce mind-altering effects. However, it does not explain the specific mechanism by which these compounds alleviate or prevent the cluster headaches. The video also mentions oxygen as a potential treatment but does not describe how it works. For other treatments like medication, no details are provided on how they function. Therefore, while the video partially covers how one treatment (psychedelic mushrooms) works, it lacks comprehensive explanations for most of the treatments mentioned."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of psychedelic mushroom treatment for Dan's cluster headaches. It mentions that the mushrooms provide Dan with two years of being pain-free and allow him to regain his passion for life. However, the transcript does not explicitly describe the benefits or lack thereof for other potential treatments like oxygen or prescription medications. The focus is primarily on the positive impact of the psychedelic mushroom treatment for Dan's specific case."," 1

The transcript does not describe any risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments mentioned, which are suicide and the use of psychedelic mushrooms for cluster headaches. While it details the excruciating pain and suffering caused by cluster headaches, and the relief provided by the mushrooms, it does not mention any potential adverse reactions, complications, or long-term risks of using the psychedelic mushrooms as a treatment. The focus is solely on the positive effects of the mushrooms in alleviating the headaches, without addressing any potential downsides or risks."," 3

The transcript partially describes the risks and benefits of not using treatment (psychedelic mushrooms) for Dan's cluster headaches. It mentions that without the mushrooms, Dan's ""unbearable cluster headaches return,"" implying a risk of continued severe pain. However, it does not provide a clear description of potential long-term risks or benefits of permanently forgoing treatment or pursuing watchful waiting. The focus is primarily on the efficacy of the mushroom treatment in alleviating Dan's symptoms. While the consequences of not taking the treatment are briefly mentioned, a more detailed discussion of the risks and benefits of no treatment options is lacking."," 5

Explanation: The transcript clearly describes how the use of psychedelic mushrooms has positively impacted Dan's overall quality of life by providing relief from the excruciating pain of cluster headaches, which had previously left him contemplating suicide. The transcript mentions that after discovering the efficacy of mushrooms, Dan experienced ""two years of pain-free living"" and regained his passion for the things he used to love. This demonstrates a significant improvement in his overall quality of life due to the treatment choice of using psychedelic mushrooms to manage his condition."," 4

The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for cluster headaches, but the information provided is somewhat unclear or incomplete.

While the video focuses primarily on the use of psychedelic mushrooms as a treatment for Dan's severe cluster headaches, it does mention oxygen therapy as another potential option, stating, ""Oxygen can sometimes abort the attacks, but if that fails, sufferers face a bout of excruciating pain that can last for up to three hours.""

However, the video does not provide a detailed comparison or analysis of the different treatment options, their respective benefits, drawbacks, or the circumstances under which one option might be preferred over the other. The emphasis is mostly on Dan's personal experience with psychedelic mushrooms and how they provided relief when other treatments failed.

Overall, the video suggests that there are at least two potential treatments (oxygen and psychedelics), but it does not present a comprehensive discussion of the"," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While it highlights the potential benefits of using psychedelic mushrooms for treating cluster headaches, it does not explicitly suggest discussing this treatment option with healthcare professionals or engaging in shared decision-making. The video focuses primarily on the personal experience of the individual suffering from cluster headaches and his family's decision to explore an unconventional treatment method. However, it does not provide guidance on how to approach this topic with medical professionals or recommendations for involving them in the decision-making process. Overall, the video raises awareness about an alternative treatment option but falls short of actively promoting shared decision-making with healthcare providers.",set()
ZPOYysJ04N8,"Hey, what's up everybody? My name is Tyler Mann. I am a director of photography and documentary filmmaker out of Austin, Texas. I'm 35 years old. You've probably seen my work. Places like here, here, here, here, and tons and tons and tons of other places. So if you have cable, you've probably seen my work. I am a fellow sufferer of cluster headaches. I'm lucky. I'm only a seasonal sufferer, so I'll only get my headaches three months out of the year. I'm just ending my cycle as we speak now. I started getting them around 2006. I wasn't quite sure what they were. I thought they were allergies, but I have pretty bad sinuses, so I thought it was all related to sinuses and allergies and stuff like that. Fast forward maybe four or five years, I finally figured out what it was and started to get treatment. Some of it's worked to some degree, most of it hasn't, like many of you know. So I decided that last year that I was going to document people like me to raise awareness. We all know that there's not much going on in the medical community when it comes to people like us. Not a whole lot of research, treatments that don't work. So basically that leads to this. What is the project? It's a documentary. It's a feature length film. So the goals of the film. This is a story about us. It's about you. It's about cluster sufferers. This is to tell our story. We want to basically make as intimate a story as we can. Our goal is to basically spend time with about four to five different families, document their day to day lives, how it's affected them, how it's affected their work, their personal lives, their love lives, their relationships with other people, their friendships, everything. We want to document it all. We also want to document the legislative process. Everything that's going on with advocacy groups, going to the headache on the hill, all that type of stuff. We want to go to these things. We want to talk to lawmakers. We want to talk to doctors. We want to cover basically every angle that we can on this. That's our goal. An all-encompassing documentary but told through personal stories. Okay, so our immediate fundraising goals. The reason why we're making this video is because we need initial seed money. It takes capital to shoot a documentary, even a five-minute documentary. It still takes capital. So this video is to send out to you guys, potential investors, sufferers. We need a little head start. We need something to get us going. Our plan is to take the money, this initial seed money, go out, shoot a couple families, throw that into a proof of concept mini-documentary that we can show other potential investors on down the road to get our full feature-length budget. So, after our initial seed investment, we're going to start a Kickstarter campaign. We're going to be open to the public, open to everybody to pitch in, be a part of this. We want everybody to feel included. We want everybody to have a voice and feel like they're a part of this project. So yeah, if you want to be a part of this, if you want to get involved early on, there is a PayPal donation link here. And there will be one in the description of the video here. And yeah, feel free, give whatever you can, you know, whatever amount helps, even a dollar, whatever you can do. So let's get out there, work together, and let's get our stories told.",Cluster Headache,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 4

The video aims to document the experiences of cluster headache sufferers and raise awareness about the condition through a feature-length documentary film.

Explanation (218 words):

The video transcript provides some relevant information about cluster headaches and the proposed documentary project aimed at raising awareness about this condition. It explains the goals and intended approach of the documentary, which involves documenting the personal stories of cluster headache sufferers, their families, and the legislative/advocacy efforts related to the condition.

However, the transcript lacks specific medical details about cluster headaches, such as their causes, symptoms, and available treatments. It does not directly address common questions that readers might have about the nature of the condition itself, its diagnosis, or its management.

ghTw40gDSR4,"You are here for one of these reasons. One, somebody sent you. Two, you love my face. Three, where are you? What is this? How do I get out of here? What's up, kleptos? Today I'm going to talk about the very rare and serious illness that I have. Cluster headaches. And before you say, I suffer from headaches and or migraines. Typical answer here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's not that type of headache. Yes, every now and again we get those pesky little buggers because the neighbor's kid Joshua is joshing around in your rose bush. And now his parents are yelling at you because apparently you forgot to cut it, but fuck that kid. Yes, we also receive all those headaches that make us want to take a bunch of Advil and sleep all day, but it's not that type of headache. Well, maybe the last part. Let me begin with a very brief and scary explanation. A cluster headache is a headache that appears in clusters. It's also relative to time. So let's say I wake up at 5 a.m. each day with a cluster headache. I will wake up at 5 a.m. for the range of attacks. The cluster headache is also very constant in its clusters. I get a headache at 5 p.m. and it'll last for maybe 15 minutes, or it could last for two hours. And I get a short break of maybe 15 minutes to an hour, maybe two, it depends on the person. And it ends abruptly, so you never know when it's going to take a break. I mean, mine could last from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m., but it depends on how many drugs I'm taking. These attacks last not just one or two days, they could last for weeks, and in some extreme cases, more than five months. They're described as one of the worst pain a human being can endure, even worse than childbirth. And I ain't never had a kid, but... That's fucked up. It was today. Another name for cluster headache, suicide headache, because literally people want to die rather than endure it. And, not to mention, there is no treatment, the continuous cycle of clinic visits, pure oxygen doses, something called a nasal spray. So what effect does this have on people? First, of course, they get super irritated and annoyed and angry. It says angry, I said annoyed. But they also get annoyed, so that's something. Pain usually resides in one corner of the face, usually around the temples slash eye area. The eye becomes swollen and often droops. Nose passageways also become swollen, which makes a patient have a runny nose and redness. Hot compresses might help, showers do wonders. They are only temporary. And the headache medicine doesn't work unless you take enough to pass out, and I'm pretty sure that might kill you. You also can't sleep. Normally, people find that cluster headaches, while laying down, cause them to be worse. You know, if you lay on the side that hurts, it hurts. If you lay on the side that doesn't hurt, it hurts. Oh, how is the pain described? And please, if you're easily disturbed, you can skip ahead. This is how I describe the pain. Imagine someone holding pliers. That person thus sticks the plier right on your nerve, and they pull the nerve really, really tightly. Then, they twist the nerve back and forth. The pain is constant, never numbing. As they are doing this, they are also jagging it up and down with a knife, punching you in the face. What are some triggers for this illness? Alcohol, fruity smell, perfumes, light, the fucking sun. Loud noises sometimes, headaches, who would've guessed? Lack of sleep, and smoke. And also, it's not just cigarettes, and you don't need to be smoking them. And if you ever think that, yes, weed helps migraines, it's totally gonna help you, don't do it. You're being an asshole. Don't smoke anything in front of someone who has a cluster headache illness. How do I? Someone who does not know about cluster headaches, insert. Help. Well, for one thing, people experiencing attacks want to be left alone. They may pace around and cry sometimes, but don't touch them. They're not interested in how nice you can rub their back. Tell them it's okay. It might just wanna make them hit you in the face. And please understand, if they do yell, it's not their fault. This is not an invitation that you can yell back. Second point, keep them in a fairly quiet place. Third, darkness is good. Four, put a cloth in hot water and squeeze it out a little bit. Give it to them so they can press it to the area that is experiencing the pain. The heat will thus numb the pain a little bit. But remember not to burn yourself, because you're using hot water, not lukewarm. Watch them in case they burn themselves, because they might not realize how hard they're pressing. Five, don't have triggers around, you sick smoker. Alcoholic bitch. Six, and this is the most important point that a lot of people overlook. Do not have any dangerous objects around them. i.e. sharp objects, hard things like tools, medicines that could be dangerous towards them. No matter how much you know this person and how happy they seem in life, they might do something drastic. This is the same for hitting themselves. If you're experiencing a patient that is hitting themselves, try to replace their hand with a softer object. Like a pillow or maybe a stuffed animal. This way they can get their anger out, distract themselves, and they don't get hurt. So that was a little bit of information about the disease that I have. I think it's a disease. If you currently suffer from it, now you know certain triggers that maybe you didn't know. Maybe some remedies that could help you, like the wet cloth thing. If you have a mother or father or maybe a brother, sister, friend who suffers from this and you didn't know what it was and you just regarded it like, oh, it's just a headache. Well, it's not just a headache. It's very serious. And now you know how to take care of them, so that's cool too. And if you were just curious what is demands one talking about, weird illness, serious illness, oh, this sounds important. Um, it is. Oh, good on you for clicking it. Anyway, this is the end. Tell me, have you ever heard of cluster headaches? Did you know what it was prior to this? Do you know anybody who has a cluster headache? Let's start a conversation. See you later, kleptos. Pfft! That's the end of the video. Why not join the gang? Because together we can be insane. Stop that. What if I just threw up? And I ain't never had a kid, but for some odd reason it makes me become a Westerner. Go out in the hallway and say it. No, it's I suffer. No, do it. What's- Oh, I suffer from- I. You know what, I'm not even gonna use it. No, no, no. Before you say- Oh, I- Really? I suffer- Fuuuck! Suffer. The word is suffer. Why do- I need you. I need you too. I need you so much.

W7woJa444kA,"Cluster headaches are one of the most severe and painful types of headaches. They are characterized by intense stabbing pain around one eye, accompanied by tearing, a runny nose, and drooping of the eyelid. When the hypothalamus in the brain becomes dysfunctional, signals are sent into a bundle of nerves called the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG. The SPG acts like a fuse box, connecting the brain to nerve endings in the face. When these signals reach the vessels, they cause dilation and activate pain receptors. Pain signals are returned to the sensory area of the brain, where they are perceived as intense pain. The resulting cascade causes excruciating, one-sided pain around the eye that can radiate to the forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on the affected side. Because of the SPG's unique location in the pain loop, it has long been a treatment target. Today, there's a new option for cluster headache patients. Introducing the Pulsante SPG Microstimulator. It's designed to stimulate the SPG, interrupting the signals that cause pain during a cluster headache. A miniature microstimulator is about the size of a penny. Most patients cannot even feel it or see it. During a minimally invasive oral procedure, the microstimulator is inserted along the pathway above the second molar that allows the microstimulator to reach the SPG. The procedure lasts about an hour under general anesthesia and leaves no visible scars. Side effects are similar to other oral procedures and most resolve within 60 days. During a cluster attack, patients place the remote to their cheek to begin stimulation. The remote controller communicates with the Pulsante microstimulator to provide immediate therapy by directing mild electrical pulses to the SPG to interfere with signals, interrupting the cluster headache pain loop, effectively flipping the switch on the fuse box, turning off the headache. Pulsante therapy is a non-drug treatment option proven to rapidly relieve the pain of cluster headaches. There is no cure for cluster headaches, but Pulsante therapy can stop the pain, allowing you to return to the things you once enjoyed and reset the clock on cluster headache. Thank you.",Cluster Headache,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0," 5

hx-HKPJwG8s,"Hey guys, Caitlin here and for this week's YouTube video I wanted to talk about cluster headaches. So cluster headaches are one of the three common types of headaches. So there's cluster headaches, migraines, and then there's tension headaches. With migraines, you're going to have that unilateral throbbing headache with associated nausea and vomiting. Sometimes there might be an aura preceding this headache. Other times you will have associated photophobia, hyperacusis. The headache's really going to be aggravated by movement. And then tension headaches are going to be a lot opposite of this. It's going to be more of a global headache squeezing in nature. They might have tight trapezius muscles associated with a lot of stress, not aggravated by movement, usually no nausea or vomiting, and usually no photophobia or hyperacusis. Now when it comes to cluster headaches, make sure you follow the DSM-5 diagnosis for these. It's usually going to include headaches that come in clusters, so headaches that can last for 15 or up to 180 minutes at a time. Usually cluster headaches are really unilateral, kind of like migraines, but they're usually centered around the eye, a little above the eye, or in the temporal area. And then a lot of times cluster headaches, you need at least one of the following physical exam findings. You need to have injected conjunctiva. You need to have lacrimation from the eye, maybe a little bit of eyelid edema, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. Usually in the forehead, there's a lot of sweating in that area or just anhydrous actually. We'll talk about Horner syndrome in a little bit. Sometimes with cluster headaches, you can have Horner syndrome, which is meiosis, so the pupil is going to be smaller in the affected eye. And then ptosis, which is just the eyelid drooping a little bit, or anhydrosis, so a lack of sweating on that side, so I don't have a lot of sweating on the other side. These patients may be very agitated and restless in the room as well. Just make sure you follow the DSM criteria for diagnosis. If you're in the emergency department and trying to make this first diagnosis, usually you have to rule out other big and bad things, and then the neurologist makes the diagnosis. But following those criteria can really help you identify a cluster headache versus something else. As I mentioned before, cluster headaches can be associated with something called Horner syndrome. This syndrome is a combination of ptosis, so eyelid drooping, meiosis, the pupil in the infected eye is constricted, and anhydrosis, so there is a lack of sweating on the affected eye. If the headache's on this side, you're going to see all these physical exam findings on that side. Now, just remember that if you see Horner syndrome, this isn't always associated with a cluster headache. You can have lung cancer that causes this, or something like a carotid artery dissection. Just keep in mind that this syndrome isn't always associated with something as benign as a cluster headache. A lot of these patients are going to be middle-aged men, and the triggers that often precede their cluster headaches unfortunately may be alcohol, it may wake them up in the middle of the night, they may have gotten done with using nitroglycerin use, or any histamine release can trigger cluster headaches. Now with a patient presenting to you in the emergency department complaining of a headache, and it sure does sound like a cluster headache, before you go and treat them for a cluster headache, ask the patient have they ever been diagnosed with a cluster headache. If they have, then usually this is done by a neurologist and they've ruled out some of the other big bad causes of headaches. But if they haven't, definitely ask the patients, and in my mind, always ask any patient with a headache some of the red flags for the headache. And for this, I like to use the mnemonic SNOOP. So the S will stand for Systemic Signs and Symptoms. So are they having any fevers, are they having any neck stiffness concerning for meningitis, or are they having persistent night sweats and now their headache is worse in the morning and they have a little bit of weight loss that's unexplained concerning for cancer. Or do they have a previous diagnosis of cancer, now that they're having these headaches that's concerning for at least secondary cancer going to the brain. And then the N will stand for any neurologic symptoms. So this is obviously concerning for stroke or any mass lesions. O can stand for an onset greater than 50 years old. Obviously concerning for giant cell arthritis or any glaucoma. Since these headaches tend to go and present around the eye, definitely make sure that the eye doesn't feel hard, there's no acute angle glaucoma. You definitely don't want to diagnose them with a cluster headache when they had acute angle glaucoma. And then the next O can stand for an onset that happens suddenly. Obviously concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage that with a sudden onset, the worst headache of your life that we all read about in books. And then the P's can stand for papilledema, obviously concerning for intracranial hypertension. Any positional changes or the headache may be precipitated by Valsalva or any progressive headaches, any new or changing headaches are all red flags of a headache. And make sure you ask this with almost every single patient. So when you're asking some of those red flags for a headache, you obviously don't want to miss some of the more dangerous causes of a headache in that area that may sound like a cluster headache. Like I mentioned before, Horner syndrome can be seen in carotid artery dissections, so make sure the patient doesn't have any neck pain. You usually don't miss this. These patients are in extreme pain and they will have symptoms in this area. Obviously you don't want to miss giant cell arteritis, so they have an itinerary palpation in this area. And they have other signs or symptoms of giant cell arteritis like jaw codification, then definitely work them up in that regard. Other signs or other headaches are trigeminal neuralgia. You can have TMJ syndrome obviously going up into that area. So just kind of think about some of the mimics, acute sinusitis or a glaucoma. You don't want to miss these other headaches that can precipitate like cluster headaches, but obviously be a little more dangerous. So just keep in mind of the mimics of a cluster headache as well. And when it comes to the treatment of a cluster headache, usually this is very simple. High flow oxygen is the treatment of choice. So these patients need to have oxygen up to 10 liters at a time and do that until their headache gets better. And then you can also do some of the other headache treatments like sumatriptan. I've done that as well along with intranasal, Ytcane 4%. These are all very helpful in addition to help control the cluster headaches. And that's it guys. Thanks for listening.

It's as though your skull is being crushed in a vise and it's gonna explode. You feel like your eyes, everything is just gonna explode out and it's like a tsunami of pain. You can't speak, you can't do anything, you're helpless. Helga has come back to the Walton Center desperate to find out what's going on. What I'm often aware of is that when we treat someone for one headache condition we will settle that down and another headache condition will leak out and I think what's happened here is we've switched it off and I think you've leaked out into a different type of headache and this headache disturbance looks more like cluster headache which is generally considered to be one of the most horrific pain conditions known. A treatment we use for cluster headache is nerve blocks. Now I know the last nerve block has turned off your hemikranial continua and this other headache condition has now come on in its place. I'm not going to threaten you with that at the moment but I think that's something to consider over the next week or two if we're really having difficulties and not controlling. So keep a diary, keep a very close idea on this and I'll write your prescription for the summa trip down. Cluster headache is notoriously difficult to treat. For now Dr. Silva gives her strong migraine drugs. If this is cluster headache he knows it will come back. It's a week since Helga Christensen last saw Dr. Silva and her headache has come back. Helga Christensen. Hi. Hi. Nice to see you. Come on in, have a seat. I can't move, I can't stand up, I can't sit down, I can't lie down, the light, everything. Have you been through normal childbirth before? Yes. Yeah, so in comparison was childbirth painful? It was but when I'm in full threat to this I would rather have that. Yeah. I know in the past we've done a nerve block and this has happened since a nerve block but one potential would be to try another nerve block procedure and I don't know if you want to do that. Oh. Do you want me to do a nerve block on you now? Yes please do something. I'll just go and get the kit for you. If you just wait a moment I'll go and get something. Helga has had this injection once before. It only offers short-term relief and there's a limit to how many times it can be used. The nerve block is a combination of steroids and local anesthetic that's injected directly into a nerve at the back of her head. So just remind me which side is the pain on? Right. Okay. Dr. Silva must control the immediate pain before he can work out a long-term solution. This isn't just about pain. I mean cluster headache is a hugely debilitating horrific condition. Generally once you have it you will usually have it through your life so there will be spells when you're affected and spells when you're well and for some people they may have it on a regular basis long term so it's a condition that's going to need managing for a long time. It's a week since Helga Christensen had a nerve block injection for a severe headache. She's now having agonizing attacks every day. I'm a bit frightened that it's spiraling a little bit do you know what I mean? I need to find some way of sort of capping it and I know you're trying your best to help me there. Yeah I think we need to get a preventative strategy that has something to work quickly and something that will work a bit more slowly over time that we can build up. For 90% of people a course of steroids will actually turn this off. Right. Very rarely people with steroids go a bit dulally on them and they start getting very depressed or agitated or you know even acting a bit strangely or even psychotic seeing things. If you had anything like that you stop it on that day but it's extremely rare especially in young people. The next thing that we do at the same time is start you on this drug for rapamil. Helga is entering a new phase of treatment. All the drugs they try now have risks attached. None of these drugs are licensed for cluster headache. We don't have drugs that have been studied and studied to the extent where they have a license in the UK. They're getting to the point where I literally would do anything if you if you said anything I would do it try it because I just have to get rid of this acute pain. Bye. The steroids worked for a few weeks but the headaches came back and with them a debilitating paralysis of her right-hand side. She's unable to walk or speak during the attacks and can't leave the house for days at a time. I'm forever the optimist about this and I will beat this. I know I'll beat it eventually and in the meantime I'll just carry on and on the good days I'll do what I'm good at like today and on the bad days curl up in a ball and hibernate and hopefully there'll be more good days than bad days.",Cluster Headache,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0," 3

The video partially conveys its aims through the introduction of Helga's severe headache condition and the doctors' attempts to treat it. However, there is no explicit statement upfront about the overarching goal or purpose of the video. The viewer has to piece together that it is documenting Helga's struggles with cluster headaches and the challenges in finding an effective treatment. While the medical aspects are well-covered, a clearer framing of the video's narrative aims would have been helpful for the viewer to better understand the context from the outset."," 4

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information about Helga Christensen's debilitating headache condition and the various treatments attempted by her doctor. It covers the symptoms, diagnosis of cluster headache, and the challenges in finding an effective treatment. However, it lacks some details on the specific causes or mechanisms behind cluster headaches. The video focuses more on documenting Helga's journey and the trial-and-error process of managing her condition rather than providing a comprehensive medical explanation of cluster headaches. Nevertheless, it offers valuable insights into the severe impact of this condition on the patient's life and the difficulties faced by healthcare professionals in treating it."," 4 (Partially relevant)

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about a patient named Helga Christensen suffering from severe and debilitating headaches, which are likely cluster headaches. It details her symptoms, the treatments tried by her doctor (including nerve blocks and various medications), and the challenges in managing her condition. However, the transcript does not provide a comprehensive overview or explanation of cluster headaches, their causes, or general treatment approaches. It primarily focuses on Helga's specific case and the treatments her doctor is attempting. While informative about her experience, it may not fully address broader questions readers might have about cluster headaches as a medical condition."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some references to sources, but they are not comprehensive or explicitly cited. It mentions that doctors recognize Helga's condition but don't know the cause, and that cluster headaches are ""generally considered to be one of the most horrific pain conditions known."" However, it does not provide specific sources for these statements. The video also discusses various treatments prescribed by the doctor, such as nerve block injections, steroids, and verapamil, but does not reference any studies or guidelines on their use for cluster headaches. While it is clear that the information is coming from the medical expertise of the doctor featured, there is no direct attribution to other sources of evidence beyond his experience and opinion. Overall, the sources of information are partially clear, but a more thorough referencing of external sources would have been beneficial."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides no clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date mentioned is ""For eight years Helga has suffered from crippling headaches,"" which refers to the duration of Helga's condition rather than the date of any source material. While the transcript appears to be a narration of Helga's medical journey, there are no explicit references to the dates or sources of the medical information presented. Therefore, the score is 2 (Partially), as only the date of the video itself can be inferred from the content."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some balanced information by presenting Helga's personal experience with the severe headaches and the treatment approaches tried by her doctor. However, it primarily focuses on Helga's specific case and the challenges in treating her condition, without providing a broader perspective on cluster headaches or comparing different treatment options. While the doctor mentions some risks associated with the treatments, the information is still largely centered around Helga's individual case rather than a comprehensive and objective overview of the condition and its management. The video lacks references to multiple research studies or a range of expert opinions, which would have made it more balanced and unbiased."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the medical treatment and advice given by the doctors featured. There are no suggestions for further reading or mentions of other organizations that could provide advice and information related to the medical condition being discussed (cluster headaches). The focus is solely on Helga's personal experience with the condition and the treatments being attempted by her doctors."," 5

Explanation: The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for Helga Christensen's severe headache condition, which is suspected to be cluster headache. The doctor explicitly mentions that there are no licensed drugs specifically studied for cluster headache, and they have to try medications off-label with potential risks and side effects. The doctor also acknowledges the unpredictable nature of the condition, stating that it may require long-term management with periods of remission and relapse. The transcript highlights the challenges and uncertainties in treating this debilitating condition, indicating a clear discussion of the gaps in knowledge and differences in expert opinion concerning treatment choices."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information on how the treatments like nerve block injections, steroids, and verapamil work, but the details are limited and lack depth. For example, it mentions that nerve block injections contain steroids and local anesthetics injected into a nerve, and that steroids can potentially turn off cluster headaches for 90% of people. However, there is no further explanation of how these treatments specifically act on the body to achieve their effects. The descriptions remain surface-level and do not go into the underlying mechanisms or pathways involved. Additionally, there is no information provided on how other mentioned treatments like sumatriptan work. Overall, while there are brief mentions of how some treatments work, the explanations are incomplete and lack sufficient detail to fully understand their mechanisms of action."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for Helga's severe headache condition. It mentions that the nerve block injection initially provided short-term relief from the pain, but it also seemed to trigger a different type of headache (cluster headache). The steroids are described as potentially able to ""turn this off"" for 90% of people, indicating a benefit of controlling or eliminating the symptoms. However, no clear benefits are described for the other treatments mentioned, such as the migraine drugs and the medication verapamil. The focus is more on trying different treatments to manage the debilitating condition rather than explicitly stating their potential benefits."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It discusses some potential side effects and complications of the nerve block injection, such as the possibility of triggering a different type of headache (cluster headache) after the initial relief. It also mentions the risks associated with steroid treatment, including potential mood changes, depression, agitation, or even psychosis, although it notes that these are rare. However, the transcript does not explicitly mention risks or side effects for the other treatments mentioned, such as the migraine drugs or the drug verapamil. Therefore, it only partially covers the risks of the various treatments discussed."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not treating Helga's condition or postponing treatment. The focus is entirely on the various treatment options being tried by the doctors, such as nerve block injections, steroids, and other medications. There is no discussion about what could happen if no treatment is pursued, or the potential consequences of watchful waiting or forgoing treatment altogether. The transcript is solely focused on the challenges of finding an effective treatment plan for managing Helga's severe headaches and related symptoms."," 1

The provided transcript does not contain any clear reference to the effects of the treatment choices on the overall quality of life or day-to-day activity of the patient, Helga Christensen. The transcript focuses on describing the severe pain and debilitating symptoms associated with Helga's headache condition, as well as the various treatments attempted by her doctor, such as nerve block injections, steroids, and medications. However, there is no explicit mention of how these treatments impact her ability to perform daily activities or her overall quality of life. The transcript only briefly touches on how the condition has prevented her from engaging in activities she previously enjoyed, but it does not discuss the effects of the treatments themselves on her quality of life."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for Helga's condition. It mentions several treatments that are being tried or considered, such as nerve block injections, steroids, and the drug verapamil. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice and under what specific circumstances. It also does not suggest or explore many alternative treatment options beyond the ones mentioned. The focus is primarily on the treatments being tried for Helga's particular case, rather than a comprehensive overview of potential treatment choices for her condition."," 3

The video partially provides support for shared decision-making. It highlights the importance of open communication between the patient (Helga) and her doctor (Dr. Silva) regarding treatment choices and their potential side effects. For instance, Dr. Silva explains the risks associated with steroid treatment and seeks Helga's consent before administering the nerve block injection. However, the video does not explicitly encourage Helga to discuss her preferences or involve her family/friends in the decision-making process. The focus is primarily on the doctor's recommendations and Helga's willingness to try any treatment to alleviate her pain.",set()

eqSTRJwQcys,"Trigger finger is a condition of the hand that limits finger movement. It is characterized by the inability to straighten a finger from a flexed position. It occurs due to tenosynovitis caused by inflammation of the tendon sheath surrounding the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The swelling and inflammation prevents the tendon from gliding smoothly through the sheath and thus the finger gets stuck in a bent position and then snaps back into place. Treatment for this condition involves releasing the swollen A1 pulley sheath surrounding the tendons. It is an open procedure in which a small incision is made along the palm to expose the A1 pulley, which is then cut. The finger is then tested to ensure that smooth flexion occurs.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0," 5

The transcript begins by defining trigger finger and describing its symptoms, followed by an explanation of the underlying cause, which is inflammation and swelling of the tendon sheath. It then goes on to describe the treatment method, which involves surgically releasing the swollen tendon sheath by cutting the A1 pulley. The step-by-step explanation of the condition and the treatment procedure indicates that the primary aim of the video is to educate viewers about trigger finger and its management."," 4

The video transcript provides a comprehensive explanation of trigger finger, including its definition, symptoms, causes, and treatment.

iAIzUb4cl4M,"- Trigger finger is a type of tendonitis in the hand, one of the most common that we see. And what happens is the tendon typically has to glide in the palm through a series of ligaments, or almost like tunnels, which we refer to medically as pulleys. And with the inflammation that comes with the tendonitis, the tendon swells, and every time it tries to glide into these little tunnels, it gets trapped and the motion of moving your finger, it kind of goes click-clunk rather than having a nice smooth motion. It can be quite tender, quite uncomfortable. And sometimes, the parts that are inflamed actually get trapped in a bent position, so it's hard to straighten your finger unless you take your other hand and work on straightening it. So trigger fingers should be treated when it's interfering with your quality of life. So, if you are finding it's annoying because you go to, you know, if you go to hold a glass and your finger kind of gets stuck and you can't let go, or you hold something smaller like a pot and you can't put it down because the finger is stuck in a bent position. More commonly, people come because it's sore, and the soreness is what they're looking for treatment of, not so much the actual locking. A treatment for trigger finger, you can try conservative management with taking Motrin, Advil. Occasionally, we'll have people try splinting the finger straight. People report that in the morning, they'll often wake up with their finger bent. And so, we find if they sleep with the finger straight at night, the tendon is not as likely to get caught. But this doesn't have a very high success rate. Then the options that we have are injecting, injecting and trying to do a procedure through the skin with a needle or doing surgery. The principles of these different treatments, our number one is to try to control the inflammation around the tendon. And number two is to make more space for the tendon to glide. So with the cortisone injection, that's direct, trying to control the amount of inflammation in the tendon, which then usually allows it to glide more smoothly. When we do what's called the percutaneous approach through the skin with a needle, we're injecting cortisone to control the inflammation, but also, we're trying to cut with the edge of the needle to open up the tunnel a little bit. This we can only offer for certain fingers, usually the middle two fingers, your middle and your ring finger. Other fingers, it's a little bit trickier, a little bit more dangerous because of nerves that are there. When we do the surgery, the goal is simply to open the tunnel where the tendon is most likely trapped and give it free rein to glide without getting trapped. Recurrence following treatment, if you go the injection route, then we find that with one injection we can cure about 70% of people. So there'll be some people who will come back. We can offer them a second injection. With that second injection, that cures about 50% of people second time around. That gives us an overall cure rate of 85% with the injection approach. If we go the surgery approach, the cure rate is closer to 99, you know, .5%. In terms of risk, with the surgery, we're opening the skin. There's certainly a slightly greater chance of infection with that approach than with the injection. But, I mean, the risk of infection with this type of an elective procedure is pretty small. So that shouldn't be the main deterrent. With the surgery, your recovery time is a little longer. You have some soreness in your palm, can't get your hand wet. So there's definitely some downtime. In terms of frequency, I would see, easily, you know, 10 to 15 trigger fingers a month that end up choosing the injection route against maybe one or possibly two that would choose the surgery route. The decision about what to do is the patient's decision, and I think that's one of the things that we pride ourselves here at Dartmouth is that we very much will have a good discussion and let people know what the different treatments are, what the, maybe the cost differences are, what the differences are in complications in recovery and success rate, and help people to make the decision that's best for them, given their demands in life, their preferences and their values, and make a decision that way.

The speaker also emphasizes that the decision about which treatment to pursue is ultimately up to the patient, based on their individual preferences, values, and lifestyle demands. This acknowledgment of uncertainty and the need for shared decision-making between the provider and patient suggests that the video effectively addresses areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices."," 4

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how the treatments for trigger finger work. It explains that the goal of the treatments is to control inflammation around the tendon and create more space for the tendon to glide smoothly. The cortisone injection aims to reduce inflammation, while the percutaneous approach with a needle involves injecting cortisone and cutting the tunnel to create more space. Surgery is described as opening the tunnel where the tendon gets trapped to allow it to glide freely. However, the details on the specific mechanisms of action for these treatments are not provided in-depth. The transcript focuses more on the overall goals and outcomes of the treatments rather than a detailed explanation of how they work on the body."," 4

Explanation: The transcript describes the benefits of some treatments for trigger finger, but not all of them.

Therefore, since risks are described for some but not all of the treatments, I have given a score of 2."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any clear description of the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for trigger finger. It focuses primarily on explaining what trigger finger is, its causes, and the available treatment options (injections, percutaneous procedure, and surgery). While it mentions the potential recurrence rates after treatment, there is no information provided about what would happen if no treatment is pursued, such as the risks of leaving the condition untreated or the potential benefits of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially addresses the effects of treatment choices on overall quality of life. It mentions that trigger finger should be treated when it's ""interfering with your quality of life,"" such as having difficulty holding objects due to the finger getting stuck. However, it does not provide a clear description of how the different treatment options (injection, percutaneous procedure, or surgery) would specifically impact day-to-day activities or overall quality of life. The information about the effects on quality of life is limited and not directly related to the treatment choices."," 5

The video clearly outlines multiple treatment options for trigger finger and discusses the pros and cons of each approach, making it evident that there is more than one possible treatment choice. The treatments mentioned include conservative management with anti-inflammatory medication and splinting, corticosteroid injection, percutaneous needle release, and surgical release. The video highlights the likelihood of success, potential risks, recovery time, and other factors to consider for each treatment option. It also emphasizes that the decision ultimately depends on the patient's preferences, values, and lifestyle demands, suggesting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and patients should carefully evaluate the alternatives before making a choice."," 4

Explanation: The video partially provides support for shared decision-making. The doctor discusses various treatment options for trigger finger, such as injections, percutaneous procedures, and surgery, along with their associated risks, benefits, and success rates. However, the doctor explicitly mentions that the decision about which treatment to choose is up to the patient, and that they aim to have a good discussion with patients to help them make the decision that best fits their preferences, values, and demands in life. This suggests that shared decision-making is encouraged, where patients are informed about the options and are involved in choosing the treatment that aligns with their personal circumstances and preferences.",set()
YwpB1fi50I4,"- [Narrator] Your forearms contain flexor muscles that allow you to bend your fingers. Long cord-like structures called tendons connect these muscles to the bones in your fingers and thumb. A tunnel of tissue called a tendon sheath surrounds each tendon. This allows the tendon to glide smoothly as the fingers move. The sheath is held in place by bands of tissue called pulleys. They hold the tendon close to the bone for optimal functioning of the tendon. When your flexor muscles contract, the pulleys help guide the tendons to flex or bend your fingers. Normally, the tendons glide smoothly through the pulleys when the fingers flex and extend. Trigger finger, also known as trigger thumb, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where the pulley at the base of your finger becomes inflamed and swollen. This makes it harder for the tendon to move through the pulley. Over time, the tendon may also swell and form a bump near the pulley. When you bend your finger, the swollen area on the tendon may cause a catching or triggering sensation as it initially gets hung on the pulley and then slips underneath. If not treated, the tendon may swell enough that it cannot pass beneath the pulley. As a result, your finger may get stuck in a bent position. If you have trigger finger, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: a tender lump on your palm at the base of your finger. A catching, popping or locking sensation when you move your finger. And pain when you bend or straighten your finger. The cause of trigger finger isn't known but some conditions that can increase your risk for it include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and repeated injuries, forceful and repetitive hand gripping may also increase your risk. To treat mild trigger finger, your doctor may advise you to rest your hand and avoid activities that make it worse. Your doctor may prescribe antiinflammatory medication or a corticosteroid injection to reduce the swelling. You may also need to wear a finger splint to keep your finger straight. If non-surgical treatments haven't worked, your doctor may advise you to have a surgical procedure. To start the procedure, your surgeon will make a small incision in your palm. Then the pulley will be cut to free the tendon. At the end of the procedure, your incision may be closed with stitches and covered with a soft bandage. To find out more about trigger finger, talk to your healthcare provider.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0," 4

I am a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR. We have now Dr. Gary and he is going to work on Sherwin. He just had ASTR class training and we will see how he is going to do his evaluation and treatment so go ahead. Okay start with where your pain is. Show me. And open. Okay. So let's get a brief history how long this has been going on. How like what's going on. So you have two years of trigger finger. Did you have an injury or? I cannot think of any. Okay. Working nursing home lifting but last year I cannot think of any incident where I injured it. Maybe from work but. So this has been going on for two years. What kind of treatment you had in the last two years? I have had myself, I thought I could get rid of it with exercise. You still have it. Did you have like physical therapy, massage, anything? Okay. I do my own treatment. You are a physical therapist. Yeah. So you have been doing your treatment. Like massage it and you did exercises on it but you still have it. It's getting better but it's still there when I wake up. How much pain now from zero to ten? It's about three. Three. At worse how much pain? In the morning it's still about seven or eight. Okay let's aggravate it now and get the symptoms before and let me see it in the camera here. Okay and open it. You definitely can see the trigger finger. Like it's stuck. Okay so we're going to do the treatment. Dr. Gary is going to work on your finger and then we'll test it again. Okay. Turn it up. Where's the pain right now? In this joint? Okay. Can it open up? Open it up. Okay. So you got some restrictions on the pain. Not pain. Okay. So guys you guys tell us about yourself while you're here. So Sherwin how long have you been practicing? I've been here practicing in California for about 15 years. As a physical therapist? Physical therapist. Okay. So who do you work with? Outpatient? I work in a skilled nursing facility. Mostly geriatric population. I've been in home health for the last three years. But a little tender. Okay. So Gary why are you working? Tell us about yourself. I've been a chiropractor for 14 years and I do home health now. And I was a physical therapy assistant for 15 years before that. So I was the oldest guy in my chiropractic class. So what? Mostly focused on soft tissue work. Didn't do a whole lot of adjusting. So what do you think about the ASTR class? You had three days of class so do you feel you're ready to work on patients? Pretty much yes. It seems to be a lot more efficient. Feel that loosen up? It's moving so much better. That really feels good. Alright. Let us know if you feel any pain okay? Just don't scream in the kitchen. That one is really restricted. You really have a bad case of trigger finger by the way. This is severe. Like I did when I was in high school. 12 So let's use the instrument and we'll. Okay. It doesn't move. It doesn't move. Do you feel you have more grip with the instrument? Easier? Yeah. In some parts. Bigger. There he is. Do you feel that difference? Mm hm. No more. And it's interesting to feel the different areas have different directions of resistance. That's correct. Is it easier to feel it with your hand or the instrument? No it's pretty easy with the instrument. It makes it easier for you? Mm hm. Easier than I thought it would be. Less pain with my hand? Less effort with the instrument you mean? Yes. Yeah, because if you use your hand repetitively with a lot of patients might have arthritis from repetitive strain injury. Overuse. So let's go for A3, A4. We'll get the whole thing. Okay. You guys feel free to switch different persons just to get the feel of working on different body parts. Did you see the trigger finger? Before. It was severe like stuck like this. Oh. Yeah. For two years. More painful proximal? Yeah. Okay. But they're there okay. Oops sorry. You're doing good Johnny. I'll get the whole thing proximal like the whole muscle tendons. Yep yep just get the whole the whole muscle. You'll do it. Really dig in. And you also can use the A4, the A3. Even the bigger one? Uh huh. Okay pressure okay. Can you feel the scar tissue? I can see it here. Right there. Do you guys see it? With the enhancement it's just uneven. It jumps. Yep you can see that exactly. And so you want to. I'll put more lotion. Do you want me to do the side too? Do you want me to do the side more? Yeah. For him. For him. Sometimes. And it's really bad he was just stuck like nothing moving when he make a fist. I feel most of the scar tissue there. Through here. Right here. Make sure you do the antagonist of that finger right in the finger. So you can do the other one. Now would you do the section at a time? Just clean the whole house quickly. Yeah save time.

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice, but the information is not explicitly clear or complete. While the focus is primarily on the Advanced Soft Tissue Release (ASTR) technique, there are brief mentions of other treatments like exercise, physical therapy, and massage. However, the video does not provide a detailed comparison or description of who might benefit more from each treatment option and under what circumstances. The emphasis remains on showcasing the efficacy of the ASTR technique for the specific case of trigger finger. Therefore, while alternatives are briefly mentioned, the information provided about treatment choices is somewhat limited."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the video demonstrates a treatment technique and encourages healthcare providers to learn the ASTR method, there is no explicit discussion about involving patients or their families in treatment decisions. The focus is primarily on the effectiveness of the technique itself and promoting the ASTR class for healthcare providers. There are no suggestions about discussing treatment options or involving patients in the decision-making process. However, the video does indirectly imply that patients should consult with healthcare providers trained in the ASTR method for treatment.",set()
Ej8FwzKnmHo,"Trigger finger and trigger thumb. Trigger finger is a condition where the involved finger will catch as it bends. The finger is straightened with a pop or a snap. The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. There is no smooth gliding of the tendon. Repetitive injuries or occupation are risk factors for the development of trigger fingers. Symptoms. In trigger finger the pain will be at the level of the A1 pulley. It will be catching and clicking and triggering with finger flexion and extension. Pain before triggering, the pain is usually not well localized and non-specific. The patient will complain of catching, the unlocking that is fixed and these are the typical stages of trigger finger. The locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed it gets caught. The condition is progressive and it may lead to a flexed finger. It commonly affects the ring and long fingers. It is an A1 pulley problem. Here is the arrangement of the pulley system and here you can find the location of the A1 pulley which causes the symptoms. So you will find the tenderness at the A1 pulley. 60% or more of patients with trigger fingers usually have associated Carpal Tannen Syndrome. It occurs more in diabetics and more in females older than 50 years old. In diabetics both hands may be affected and multiple digits in the hand can be affected. Diabetics patients have a better prognosis. Diabetes is a poor prognostic indicator for non-operative treatment and these patients are prone to develop stiffness or recurrence of the condition after surgical release. In addition to diabetes there are some other medical conditions that can be associated with trigger fingers such as gout, pseudo gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Cercoidosis, Hypotheridism. Treatment of trigger finger. Conservative treatment, the most important prognostic indicator for a good result with non-operative treatment is the duration of triggering before coming to the doctor. An irreducible locked trigger finger with flexion contracture of the PIP joint should not be treated conservatively or even by injection. It will need surgery. Conservative treatment with splinting, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, rest and modifying activity. It will give some relief to the patients. Injection, inject into the sheath not into the tendon. 60 to 80% of non-diabetic patients may get better with injection. Watch the dose of the steroid that is given in diabetic patients. Injection is not very effective in diabetic patients. Also try to obtain hemoglobin A1c in these patients before considering injection or any surgical intervention. The injection can be repeated up to three times. The majority of the patients get better with injection or surgery. What is the technique of injection? Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the poly. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to the bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication freely. Inject the medication into the sheath or into the poly freely. Surgery is done if the non-operative treatment fails and that will include release of the A1 poly. There is a higher recurrence in diabetic patients with surgery. The release of A1 poly can be percutaneous or it can be open. Percutaneous release of A1 poly can be done for the fingers but not for the thumb because the radial digital nerve almost crosses in the middle of the surgical field and it can be injured. When releasing the A1 poly, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The A2 and A4 polys are important structures and should not be touched, excised or released. Only A1 poly is cut and released and the flexor tendon is released. Surgical release. How do you release the A1 poly? The procedure is done with local anesthesia to allow intraoperative assessment and to communicate with the patient to confirm that adequate release was done. Here there is a surgical case. The incision is marked out in the palmar crease for surgical division of the A1 poly. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery and the fingers are usually marked on the palmar aspect and the dorsal aspect. The A1 poly is exposed and released. Notice the patient also had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is frequently associated with the condition of trigger finger. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appears released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the procedure. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, patients may need excision of the slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis. How about trigger thumb? This is the incision for the surgical release of trigger thumb. The incision for trigger thumb is placed in the MP flexion crease. When releasing the flexor pollicis longus tendon, watch out for the digital radion nerve. It's in the field of surgery. Thank you very much. I hope that was helpful.

EAzo4iF4dv0,"Hi, this is Dr. Levi here at Glendale Outpatient Surgery Center with another one of our really wonderful instructional videos. So today we'll be talking about trigger finger also called stenosyptinosynovitis. A patient will present with one of their fingers locked in this position. This happens and occurs because the A1 pulley or the flexor tendon sheath, there's edema and fibrosis in this area causing the tendon to be trapped under the A1 pulley and they're unable to extend the thumb completely. It'll flex down but they cannot extend it. Now this can occur with any of the fingers. Why people develop trigger finger, no one knows why exactly. However, we do find to be fairly common in people who have diabetes and sometimes it can present after someone has a carpal tunnel release for some unknown reason but it does happen. Now how do we prevent it? I want to show you some exercise that I found to be fairly effective in my practice. So let's start with the thumb again. If the thumb is effective and locks down like this and they're unable to extend the thumb, I recommend that they start with light massage directly over this area. This is the area of the A1 pulley. For each finger there's a pulley. This is the A1 pulley in this area. To massage over this area and to bring the thumb, if the thumb is affected, up and down and to make a fist, up and down. I recommend doing this approximately three times a day for about two minutes. Very easy exercise to do, not difficult at all. Now let's talk about treatment modalities for trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. First we start with anti-inflammatory medication. Next, physical therapy. If those modalities don't help, acupuncture. If that doesn't help, the next thing we can consider would be an injection to the finger with a steroid. In my practice I use Kenalog and Markane. Both of these work very effective. The Kenalog is a steroid and the Markane is the analgesic. So with that said, if the steroid injection is not effective, then the last treatment modality would be surgical intervention which would be release of the A1 pulley. It's a very, very effective surgical procedure. It takes approximately three to five minutes to do properly and it's quite effective for most patients. Let's talk about some lifestyle change that you may want to consider if you have trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis. Exercise every day. Stay healthy. Drink more water. Eat more fruits, nuts, vegetables and grains. Of course, attempt to do those stretching exercises that I showed you at least two or three times a day. These are things that I think can help you on your journey if you have and if you develop trigger finger or stenosynthium synovitis.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0," 4

DISCFr0YeiM,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop-like structure called the A1 pulley, and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little ridge structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. And once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and then it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric artery. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which averts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. Usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0," 5

The flexor tendon becomes thick and irritated as it slides through the tendon pulley causing a thickened nodule and triggering of the tendon. Discrepancy between the diameter of the tendon and the size of the pulley causing the triggering. Symptoms. Pain located at the palm at the base of the finger. Tenderness at the a1 pulley. It occurs more in women, more in diabetics, also in rheumatoid arthritis. It can be from repetitive injuries or occupational. Locking can occur when the tendon is unable to pass through the sheath. As the tendon becomes inflamed, it gets caught. Treatment. Rest is planting injection into the sheath. Do not inject into the tendon. Injection can be repeated. Surgical release of a1 pulley at the last resort. When you are releasing the a1 pulley, the release should be done at the level of the MP joint. The a2-a4 pulleys are important. They should not be touched, excised or released. Only a1 pulley is caught and released and the tendon is released. Technique for injections. Injection into the flexor tendon sheath may provide relief for triggering of the finger. The neurovascular bundle is on the side of the tendon and the pulley. Go with the needle straight forward at 90 degree to the tendon. After the site is marked, use a 25 gauge needle. Advance the needle through the midline down to bone. Pull the needle back slightly and inject the medication into the sheath or the pulley freely. How do you release the a1 pulley? Incision is made on the MP flexion crease. Here is a surgical case. The incision is marked in the palmar crease for the surgical division of the a1 pulley. Notice that the correct fingers are marked before surgery. The a1 pulley is exposed and released. You can see the tendon over the hemostat appear released. The patient is asked to move the fingers to confirm the success of the operation. How about trigger thumb?

_DVTsOZREPY,"Trigger finger, or stenosing tinnocinnovitis, is a common condition seen by hand surgeons. It's caused by swelling in the flexor tendons, which bend your fingers into your palm. Sometimes, if the tendon is too swollen, it can cause the finger to get stuck and be very painful when you try and straighten it. Trigger finger can occur after a period of overuse, but can also have an insidious onset without a history of overuse injury of the hands. It occurs because the flexor tendons at the base of your finger enter a series of pulleys, or tunnels, and the swollen tendon can get caught on the edge of the tunnel as you bend and straighten your finger. When the swollen tendon gets stuck on one side of the tunnel, patients often have to force their finger straight, which can be very painful. It is common for catching or locking of the digit to be worse at night or in the morning while the tendon is more swollen. This is because when you sleep at night, tendons tend to swell a little bit more, and the swelling may resolve throughout the day, causing less catching or locking of your fingers. Trigger finger is very common. It is associated with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis. However, trigger finger occurs frequently in patients without a history of these conditions. Typically, there are four stages of a trigger finger. Initially, the patient may have tenderness to palpation at the base of their finger at the level of the first pulley or entrance to the tunnel. Next, the patient may notice that their finger has a catching sensation as they flex and extend their finger. Third, the patient may experience locking of the finger, where they have to manually straighten their finger, and this is usually associated with a painful pop. Finally, when the inflammation is very severe, the finger will remain fixed and locked in an extended position. At this point, it is often too painful for the patient to bend their finger into their palm. If you begin to experience symptoms similar to a trigger finger, you can first try at-home care by resting, icing, and stretching the finger. Taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or aspirin may also help reduce pain. If your pain won't go away or gets worse, then it may be time to make an appointment with a hand surgeon to be properly diagnosed. Often, trigger finger can be treated successfully without surgery. The typical first line of treatment is a steroid injection to the affected finger. The injection decreases the amount of inflammation within the tendon, therefore allowing the tendon to glide more smoothly through the tunnel. Generally, two out of three patients will have a successful result from the steroid injection, and no further treatment may be necessary. Sometimes, the steroid injection may last for several months, and another steroid injection can be administered to the area as symptoms recur. If the finger continues to trigger after two to three steroid injections, or if the injection does not provide long-lasting relief, your surgeon may recommend surgical release of the A1 pulley. Surgery involves cutting the roof of the tunnel, which allows the tendon to glide more smoothly. A trigger finger release can typically be performed under just local anesthetic, with minimal discomfort following surgery.",Trigger Finger,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0," 5

FyUzORrK75g,"Let's take a look at trigger finger surgery. Trigger finger is one of the most common conditions that a hand surgeon treats. Of course, most commonly from frequent keyboard use, as you can see here, frequent texting, anything repetitive that causes the fingers or thumbs to move can cause this problem. As you can see here, this is the actual, it's a painful triggering condition where the finger snaps back and forth. The ring finger is most common but can occur in any digit. Now let's take a look at an animated anatomical picture here. The blue structures are the flexor tendons. There's two to each finger and one to the thumb. And they go through a little, these white bands, what we call pulleys. And it's within these bands that you get the mechanical advantage to be able to bend the fingers into the palm. As you can see from this picture, the fingers are being bent into the palm. And now as we straighten, you can see, again, the tendons are moving back and forth. Now what happens is from repetitive use, you get a little nodule that forms in the palm on one of the tendons. And that nodule becomes larger over time from repeated friction. And much like a little knot in a rope trying to go through a pulley, this nodule starts ramming into the flexor sheath or pulley system. And it actually can grate back and forth causing this popping of the joint just beyond that, or the middle joint in the finger. In severe cases, the finger can actually become locked straight. But more commonly, it's locked in a bent position. Now initially when the patient comes in, we will do a cortisone shot, effective in about 50% of cases. But you will see from an animated video here, we'll actually show you the surgical procedure. We make a little cut, local anesthetic, about a five minute outpatient procedure, a little light sedation. We actually cut the band that's impeding the tendon. And we open that up. That allows the finger to bend. We place several sutures, two or three, four sutures in place, and a little light dressing. Now an actual picture or video of a patient undergoing this procedure, you can see here, putting the scissors right underneath this white structure here. The retractors are in place. We're snipping with the scissors, that band. You can see a great picture here of that actual opening up of that band. In this case of this patient, she had no flexion. Upon releasing her tendon immediately, once we awakened her during the procedure, she could bend the thumb. So after the procedure, it's about 10 days with a little light dressing or band aid over the incision. You're moving it right away. Sutures come out 10 days later. And then it's about a four week total recovery, just because it's a sensitive skin to place a cut on the hand. So it's about four weeks, give or take, for all the soreness to go away. But activity is tolerated. Now, there's very little chance of recurrence with this condition. But what you will see, it'll pop up in other fingers over time. One is several months later, just from using the other hand or the same hand, you can get repetitive motion. And another one comes up.

0VSxtk1oQ2s,"Hey everyone, Dr. McClellan. I wanted to show you a great video that I took on trigger finger injection. Learning how to inject a trigger finger well is an important part of just routine clinic in plastic surgery or hand surgery. And I wanted to show you how I do it. It may be different than the way that you do it and hopefully a couple of the tips are helpful for you. I'll put up here, I've never done it before, but I'll try to put right there an article from Journal of Hand Surgery showing trigger finger is very effective at relieving initial symptoms of trigger finger with a little steroid shot of Kenalog 40 and some lidocaine. I like to stay right in the middle of the finger so that you're not near the nerve-vascular bundle which tend to be in the sulcus along the side of the tendons. So if you stay right over the tendon, you're pretty safe. I'll show you how to get the tendon into the right plane and I'll show you on a schematic where that plane is. And some of the tips that I do that I think gives me good steroid injections and prevents other complications. I tend to mix Kenalog 40 and lidocaine together. I use the lidocaine as kind of a diagnostic if the pain goes away of the node-as-node going under the A1 pulley, then generally the steroid is in the right place and they will get relief in a couple of weeks. As always, I hope you like the video. If you like it, give it a thumbs up, share the video and thanks so much for watching. Have a great day. Okay. So let's say this is your tendon and here is your pulley. The space where you want to be is right in here, okay, between the pulley and the tendon. That's where you want to deliver the steroid. So if you bring your needle in, okay, and the needle point goes into the tendon, when you wiggle the finger, this needle will move back and forth and that way you can tell that you're in the tendon. And so then what you do is you simply back up a little bit, okay, and until the tendon stops or until the needle stops moving with the tendon and then you gently press down on the plunger and you can get the steroid and local anesthetic right into that space which is where you want to be. So lidocaine plane, Kinlog, O1CC syringe. I like a larger needle to draw it up and then like a 27 to inject it. And I do not push it out of the end until I'm ready to inject because it'll clot the needle off. Okay, we're doing middle finger and ring finger, correct? Okay Rachel, let's see if you can come more over it. Okay, and he clicks right there. You can feel it and right there. So sir, what I'm going to do is go in with the needle and then I'll talk to you as I do it, okay? Okay. So now when I'm ready to go in, I will squirt out a little bit, okay? And I'm going to come down right in the middle of the finger. Stick? Are you okay? Mm-hmm. So I come down, wiggle the tip of your finger a little bit. See it moving? Okay, so that's too far. So I'm going to back off of that a little bit and I'm going to just really easily push it in. And it should go in nice and easy. And I do about 0.4, okay? I'm going to come over to this side. Go in, about right there. Stick. Wiggle the tip of your finger. So that's not in yet. I'm going to go in a little bit further and then I felt it right there. And it's, I mean, your resistance, I back up a little bit and now I'm right in the sheath. Okay? Now I'm going to have you make a fist for me.

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for trigger finger injection. The medical expert acknowledges that the technique demonstrated may differ from how others perform the procedure (""It may be different than the way that you do it""). Additionally, the expert emphasizes the importance of proper needle placement and discusses using lidocaine as a diagnostic tool to ensure the steroid is injected in the right location (""I use the lidocaine as kind of a diagnostic if the pain goes away of the node-as-node going under the A1 pulley, then generally the steroid is in the right place and they will get relief in a couple of weeks""). This suggests that there is some uncertainty in determining the optimal injection site and that the expert employs a specific technique to increase the likelihood of successful treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some details on how the trigger finger injection treatment works, but the explanation is incomplete or unclear in certain aspects. The doctor mentions that the goal is to deliver the steroid and local anesthetic between the tendon and the pulley (the A1 pulley), which is the space where the injection should be given. However, there is no clear explanation of how the steroid and anesthetic specifically act on the body to relieve the symptoms of trigger finger. The transcript focuses more on the injection technique itself rather than the mechanism of action of the treatment. Some key details about how the treatment works are missing or not clearly described."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially describes the benefits of the trigger finger injection treatment. It mentions that the steroid injection is ""very effective at relieving initial symptoms of trigger finger"" and that the lidocaine helps determine if the injection is in the right place, which should provide relief in a couple of weeks. However, the transcript does not explicitly discuss the benefits of any other treatments or mention any long-term benefits or prevention of recurrence. It primarily focuses on demonstrating the injection technique itself."," 2

The video partially describes the risks or potential adverse effects associated with the trigger finger injection treatment. The doctor mentions that staying in the middle of the finger and away from the nerve-vascular bundle helps avoid complications. He also states that clotting the needle off is a potential issue, which he avoids by not pushing the medication out until ready to inject.

However, the video does not explicitly describe other potential risks or side effects of the steroid injection, such as infection, tendon rupture, skin discoloration, or systemic effects of the steroid. It focuses primarily on the technical aspects of performing the injection correctly."," 1

aSt5GuiIGf8,"I'm Dr. Arnold Batson. We're here in the operating room at St. Francis Eastside Surgery Center. We have a patient that has triggering of her index and long fingers. This lady has a trigger finger of both her index and her long fingers today. That means that the fingers, when she closes them down, sometimes stick and won't open very well and sometimes even have to be pried open. We're going to make a small incision, go into the flexor tendon sheath that gets tied around the tendons and release the tendon sheath so that the rough part of the tendon can slide through that again without causing the locking or the catching. We're preparing to do the surgery now. This lady's been prepped with disinfectant for the skin. I've marked where we're going to make the proposed incision and she's already numb and anesthetized. So making the incision, get some little bit of bleeding from some little small vessels, then some spreading to get down to the tendon sheath. This is the tendon sheath, the white structure that's running through there. I know it's in a hole and it may be difficult to see, but that's the band that we're going to cut. Okay, we've made a small incision in the sheath. Now we're going to enlarge that or lengthen it a bit. When you're doing this operation, you have to watch out for the little small nerves that run on either side of the tendon and tendon sheath and protect those. We've just opened the tendon sheath and now we're lifting the tendons up out of the bed that they sit in. You may be able to see them move as we move the finger. Here's the split area or the little frayed area that binds or catches as the tendon slides through the sheath. We just do a little touch-up smoothing that. That ensures that it glides well inside. Now the sheath's been released. The tendon can move well through there. So that one is fixed now. This one is similar. It may be even more difficult to see from the angle that the camera's positioned. This is the tendon sheath, again the whitish structure that's in there, and making a little small opening into it. These tendons look like they're going to be pretty frayed also when we get them out to take a look at them. Okay. One of the tendons looks pretty good. It's nice and smooth, but there's a lot of fraying in this little bit of splitting in the other tendon that's likely the cause of the problems in this one. There's the reddish streak. There's the split in the tendon that's probably the cause of the locking and catching with this one. The problem with this is a degenerative wear and tear of the tendons. It's a little worse than people that have diabetes for some reason, but it occurs in almost everyone to some, all professions and all sexes, both male and female, have problems with this. So this one's completed now. It's back in its little sheath and sliding well through there. So now we're ready to close up the incision. We'll wash it out. And for these we use some little small absorbable buried stitches and then cover the wound or the incision with Dermabond or Surgeseal or another type of surgical adhesive so that the patient can usually start washing the hand or taking a shower in about 48 hours. The procedure does make the fingers sore and stiff for a few days and normally I would tell most patients that it takes around two to two and a half weeks to pretty well recover from this altogether. Here. This type of incision causes very little scarring. Even though this one is four centimeters or so long, the palm heals very nicely and makes very little scar as opposed to incisions elsewhere on the body where the scarring is much more obvious. We've gotten the incision closed now, so we're going to put a local anesthetic in that will keep this numb for the next three or four hours before the feeling all comes back so that the patient doesn't leave here having some burning or stinging in the area. Okay, we just applied the surgical adhesive or the substance that's going to keep this sealed and snug together for the next several days. We've finished the procedure now. Dressings are applied and from here the patient's going to go to the recovery room for a few minutes. Probably in 30 minutes or 45 minutes she'll be ready to leave and go home. In about 48 hours she can remove the dressing and then she can go to the in about 48 hours she can remove the dressings and begin rinsing her hand in running water, taking a shower, but not submerging it in bath water or dish water for several days. She can use her fingers. They'll be a little tender or sore at first, but fairly quickly she can get back to normal usage. I'll see her back in the office in nine or ten days and make sure everything's healing well. And frequently for this procedure that's the only time that I need to see the patient back. If they're having any particular problems getting the movement or getting their fingers closed completely down into a clenched fist, I will see them again in another two or three weeks to make sure that they've fully recovered that. But most patients it goes pretty quickly for this type of operation.",Trigger Finger,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 4

0MckpiWxrN4,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb it's a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteries. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. At this time I'm cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient has had a very long standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thin fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of the surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0," 5

Tt1-_eNMC9Y,"Hello, this is Dr. Janusz. This next video is going to be a trigger finger release. We're going to be releasing the A1 pulley of this patient's finger, which is what causes the trigger. The surgery, as usual, starts with the marking of my incision with a skin marker. Here you'll see I'm palpating the A1 pulley. You can feel this in your own hand as the pea-sized knot right in this location. People who have trigger fingers, this is often enlarged and extremely tender. You actually have several options in this particular incision. You can do a diagonal incision, you can do a straight on incision, and some people do one that is transversely across the palm. Testing the anesthesia with some forceps, making sure that the patient is comfortable, and the skin incision is made with a 15 blade scalpel. As in with most of the other surgeries that you'll be watching, there are always important structures immediately below the skin, especially in the hand. You have to be very careful when making a decision not to plunge deep down into those structures, and therefore we proceed nice and slow, dissecting down and identifying nerves and arteries that need to be preserved. The dissection is taken down through to the A1 pulley, and as I encounter any small blood vessels, those are cauterized with bipolar cauterine. Using scissors to gently spread down to the A1 pulley, I'm being careful to protect the digital nerves and arteries. This is a trigger finger retractor, which you see just go in. Now I'm getting a few final bands of fibrous tissue off of the A1 pulley, so that I can see the pulley clearly and divide it. The camera is showing an excellent view of the A1 pulley. It's the white structure that I'm pointing at now with my freer elevator. You can also see, if you look closely, the white line between the pulley and the tendon, which is slightly more yellow. Right there is the end of the pulley. The pulley is then divided longitudinally. Here I'm using a beaver blade to start the cut, and then I will come back in with some littler scissors and finish that. You're now seeing the flexor tendon, which is nicely displayed after the A1 pulley is retracted off of it. I'm then using some scissors to just gently push away the leaflets of the A1 pulley. Now I'm picking up the pulley with my forceps to demonstrate the anatomy. The digital nerves and arteries are just on the outside of this. I also use a retractor to pick up both flexor tendons to the finger and make sure that there's no fibrous connection between them. There's often quite a bit of scarring between both tendons and somebody who has a severe A1 pulley disease, and I like to break up those adhesions prior to finishing the surgery. This patient's finger is nice and smooth and the triggering is gone. Oftentimes the patient will be awake during this and just under local anesthetic. In those situations we can actually ask the patient to move their finger and demonstrate that the triggering is now gone. The wound was gently irrigated with saline and now we're going to be closing this with some nylon sutures. I'm going to be using a horizontal mattress technique. These sutures are usually left in for eight days. We allow the patient to take down their dressing at day four and cover these with a band-aid. The patient in the recovery room starts doing some exercises immediately, keeping the finger moving, and is asked to make fists at least 10 times an hour until follow-up. Some zero form dressing is then applied over the wound and that's the end of this trigger finger release. Hope you enjoyed it.

iqw1TDyzvjo,"I began to perform percutaneous releases of trigger fingers about 35 years ago as a technique to release remaining bands following an open procedure without another operation. This was soon adapted to initial procedures. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be done in an office setting effectively with minimal morbidity. After the first presentation at a national meeting, there was a general reluctance to perform the procedure. This continues until the present time and appears to be due to a safety concern about damage to the tendons and nerves. The procedure has evolved over the past 35 years. This short video will demonstrate the procedure with emphasis on safety and effectiveness. The actual triggering must be identified at the time of the procedure because the completeness of the release is determined by the absence of triggering. If there is a history of triggering and only recurrent pain, intrathecal steroid injection is the preferred management. If on physical examination there is some more than usual thickening of the A1 pulley, then ultrasound is now recommended to demonstrate hypertrophic tenosynovium, which is one of our remaining few indications for an open release when an intrathecal injection is not successful. The patient is instructed to surgically scrub his hand using a scrub brush followed by sterile water irrigation. The hand is then wrapped in a sterile towel while the patient is walked to a seat where the procedure will be performed. I prefer to have some patients lie down, especially if they are anxious. The surgeon should be the individual to inject the local anesthetic because the tendon sheath can be palpated and precisely identified at the time. The most easily tolerated injection in my experience begins at the MP flexion crease extending gently proximally, injecting in and along the tendon sheath and also superficially enough so that subsequent needle sticks are minimally felt by the patient. Palpation of the patient's palm with the thumb of the non-dominant hand just to the side of the flexor sheath makes it easier for the surgeon to direct the needle along the course of the A1 pulley and get superficial enough without worrying about puncturing the skin and even sustaining a needle stick injury himself. A 30 gauge needle is used to inject 1% lidocaine using a 10 milliliter syringe. The injection is done to a point approximately 1 cm proximal to the proximal transverse polymer crease. I begin the release proximally to the proximal flexion crease using a 16 gauge needle which is large enough to feel under the skin and stiff enough so that it can be easily controlled without bending. The dominant hand is used to pierce the skin and direct the course of the needle longitudinally over the flexor tendon sheath. The actual release is done from proximally to distally with a downward pressure with a non-dominant thumb to release the horizontal bands of the A1 pulley one at a time with only the needle tip, similar to a subcutaneous release of a dupetron's band using the Luck Fasciotomy technique. The vertical orientation of the needle tip is also maintained by identifying the position of the syringe with a needle in the vertical position before insertion. This technique I have dubbed the Pressure Push Method. Specifically placing the needle point underneath the flexor tendon sheath is avoided to avoid cutting the flexor tendon. Also having the patient totally relax the finger is critical because it further reduces the chance of the tendon to be damaged because only the tight tendon sheath is under tension, not the flexor tendon. After the first pass, the needle is gently used to palpate the released A1 pulley, releasing any remaining bands. Then the needle is retracted completely and the patient asks to flex and extend the finger. The site of any remaining triggering at that time can be determined with palpation and a new insertion point along the course of the A1 pulley more distally can be used to further precisely divide any remaining contributing bands. Usually a third puncture site is required to completely release the A1 pulley. Again, after each pass, during retraction of the needle, gentle palpation is used to determine whether any remaining bands need to be popped. Incomplete release is the end point of the procedure because an incomplete release appears never to get better with time. A folded 4x4 gauze is held in place with a half length 2 inch ace wrap. The patient is instructed to move his fingers normally and elevate his hand for at least 24 hours. An analgesic such as Tylenol 3 is prescribed. The following morning the patient is instructed to remove the dressing, wash his hands normally and reapply the ace wrap which can be helpful for the next two or three days. The average course is one or two days of discomfort. I have had patients resume playing golf the following day. Most patients however have some discomfort for about a week. A few patients have pain longer than that and I have had a handful that have had a reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome which required hand therapy. In general most patients do better than those with an open procedure.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0," 4

The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger, but the information is not entirely complete. It mentions that for some cases with recurrent pain but no triggering, an intra-articular steroid injection is the preferred management. It also suggests that for cases with significant thickening of the A1 pulley and if the steroid injection is unsuccessful, an open release procedure may be considered. However, the video primarily focuses on describing the percutaneous release technique and does not provide much detail on who would be the ideal candidate for each treatment option or under what specific circumstances one option may be preferred over the others. While it implies there are multiple treatment choices, more clarity on the criteria for selecting each option would make it a stronger explanation of the available choices."," 2

FrQpFy7grtY,"Hello, this is Dr. Stephen Traum, hand surgeon in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I'm going to take you through a surgery for trigger finger. First, I'm going to mark the skin where we're going to make our incision. We do it through a natural crease in the palm so that it blends in nicely later when it heals. I'll also mark the course of the flexor tendon itself up and down the hand to show that the incision is centered over it. Once we incise the skin, as shown here, we'll do some simple blunt dissection down to the flexor sheath. Trigger finger is an inflammatory condition of the tendon in which you get an inflammatory knot around the tendon that causes it to click or lock when you try to bend the finger. The inflammatory knot gets caught on one of the structures of the tendon sheath, which is a belt loop like structure called the A1 pulley and that's the structure we're ultimately going to incise. Here we put some retractors in to expose the flexor sheath. The little red structure is a small muscle in the hand. As we bend the finger, we can feel the clicking and see some of the inflammatory nodule there. Here I'm putting the tips of my scissors underneath the A1 pulley, which is the beginning of the flexor sheath and the area where the tendon gets caught or locked. We'll do some additional dissection to clear the pulley from the surrounding tissue before we incise it. Now once it's clear, we bring the scissors in and actually cut the pulley, exposing the underlying flexor tendons. Now you generally have two tendons in each finger. The first is called the flexor digitorum superficialis, which just bends the middle joint of your finger. The second is the flexor digitorum profunda, which bends all of the joints of your finger. Once we get the tissue cleared out, we'll lift up on one of the tendons. This will be the flexor digitorum superficialis, and make sure that it does bend the finger and that it's not getting caught or locking. Next we'll go down and get the flexor digitorum profunda tendon and do the same thing and visualize all joints of the finger bending appropriately. By lifting the tendons out of the wound, we mimic active flexion of the finger and contest to make sure that the triggering has resolved. We can also move the finger passively and make sure that the tendons are gliding nicely. Once that's done, essentially the surgery is over and we wash the wound out. We'll let the tourniquet down, which restores blood flow to the hand. You can see the hand pinking up now. And then we'll control bleeding with simple direct pressure or occasional use of electric caudary. Once we're satisfied, we close the wound. I like to use a horizontal mattress suture, which everts the skin edges up and makes for a nice thin scar that blends in with the palmar crease, so it's hard to see later on. I also like to use a non-absorbable suture. This way we remove the stitches in two weeks and there's no foreign material left in the hand. It usually only takes about three or four stitches to close the wound. What's nice about a small incision is that there's usually very little post-operative pain. Patients rarely require very much medication. I also like to inject long-acting numbing medicine into the wound, which further helps with post-operative discomfort. We then place a sterile bulky dressing on the hand, and that essentially wraps up trigger finger surgery. Thank you.",Trigger Finger,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0," 5

9RO2LJKVQZo,"This is Rashara Dages discussing today a trigger thumb or A1 pulley release. Here we're making our transverse incision here in the flexor crease along the area of the A1 pulley. Care is taken with our incision to ensure that we only go just deep enough to get to the subcutaneous tissue. This is to ensure that we do not injure the radial neurovascular bundle. Using small double hooks, we're able to dissect with care taken again to remove the tissue but get down to the flexor tendon sheath. The pulley is now identified and an attempt is made to identify the radial nerve and neurovascular structures. You can see the nerve there. So a crowd retractor is then placed in to retract the nerve. Here you can see the pulley and you can see the proximal edge of the pulley is illustrated here by our scissor. We will use a knife to incise the proximal edge extending distally. Here we can see the pulley begin to open. We then use a tonotomy scissor to complete the release distally. Care is taken again not to injure the tendon or disrupt the neurovascular bundle and now proximally the release is completed as well. The pulley leaflets are easily identified and they're easy to note complete release because of the redundancy that is now in the leaflets. Any residual catching or triggering which is noted with active flexion is then released. Here again we can see smooth motion of the tendon itself and now the skin is closed using a 3-0 nylon suture. Two mattress sutures typically take care of the closure. Soft dressing is in place and patient is allowed active motion of the IP joint immediately. Sutures are removed typically in 10 to 14 days and from that point activity is unrestricted.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0," 4

m0Wu6rd9ItA,"In mild cases of trigger finger, anti-inflammatory medication may be helpful. However, usually the standard for conservative treatment is a cortisone shot directly into the tendon to reduce inflammation. Within three to five days, you should know if this is going to be successful. However, if conservative treatment fails, a surgical option is a quick, simple procedure where the band overlying the tendon is snipped, thereby relieving pressure on the tendon and relieving the problem. With trigger finger surgery, a one centimeter incision is made after IV sedation is administered in the operating room and a local anesthetic. After a tiny incision here in the palm, a small band is clipped, relieving pressure on the tendon. Within minutes, you are asked to actively flex and extend the fingers, assuring there is no further popping at that time. Then you are taken to the recovery room and within 30 minutes to an hour, you are on your way home. The recovery following trigger finger surgery is rapid, usually returning to full movement within several days and full activities within several weeks. You may have persistent pain or soreness where the cut is across the palm for up to six weeks. After trigger finger surgery, it is very unusual to have a recurrence and is one of the few problems in the hand that actually usually does not recur after surgery.

8LMg4PX1VJc,"This is David Drake reviewing a short video of a trigger finger A1 pulley release on the long finger. The typical incision that I like is a transverse incision in the distal palmar crease. The nodules on these tendons are usually palpable and the incision is made over the nodule. The incision is usually in the 1 cm range. The skin is opened and deeper dissections are accomplished with the scissors using a spreading technique. The spreading is done along the long axis of the digit with care not to injure any neurovascular structures. A superficial palmar fascia is released and the A1 pulley is then identified. Once the pulley is identified it is incised and opened. Depending on the nature of the tendon nodule, a portion of the pulley may be removed or a synonym around the tendon may be resected as well. A complete release of the A1 pulley is accomplished. The finger is checked for triggering. The fondness of the tendon is also looked at to be sure there is no nodularity associated. In this case there was extra synonym around the tendon and this was removed. The wound is enclosed with floral monofilament usually in a mattress fashion to divert the skin edges. The patient is placed in a light dressing without splinting and is encouraged to move from day 1.

However, it does not discuss the impact of the treatment choices on patients' ability to perform daily activities or their overall quality of life after treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It mentions the traditional treatments of medication, cortisone injections, and surgery, but it does not provide details on who might benefit more from each option or under what circumstances one treatment might be preferred over another. The focus is primarily on introducing and promoting the new treatment technique developed by the doctor in Thailand. While it suggests that this new technique could be an alternative to the traditional treatments, it does not offer a clear comparison or guidance on how to choose between the different options based on individual patient circumstances."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any support for shared decision-making. It solely focuses on describing a new treatment technique for trigger finger, a medical condition affecting the fingers. The transcript does not mention or suggest any discussion with family members, friends, doctors, or health professionals regarding treatment choices. It merely presents the new treatment as an alternative to existing methods like medication, injections, or surgery. There is no indication of encouraging patients to participate in the decision-making process or weigh the pros and cons of different treatment options in consultation with others.",set()
AQCoMbYRaUo,"this little product can make a big impact on your finger if it is triggering. So it comes in different sizes. I have two sizes here with me. They say the size on the back. This one is a four and then this one is a seven. So they come they go all the way up to like 14. So I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you. The way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking. So this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it. But if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is catching or locking, meaning like when you make a fist, it has you have a hard time lifting it back up. That's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger. You want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you. But if your finger is really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck, that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger. And that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys. So there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone. If you didn't have those, our tendons would be popping away from the bone. So sometimes, though, that swelling gets enlarged. So the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger. And it's like pulling a grape through a straw, which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain. And when you go to grasp, it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size. And that's why you get that popping or that clicking or that catching. And then it can stay down. And then it's unable to get back through that pulley, and that's when you have to physically pull that up. So say my ring finger is getting stuck down. So you put the oval eight splint on your finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint. And what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist. So it still lets you bend here at the tip, which is important. And it still lets you bend at the knuckle, which is also important. But it won't let you make the full fist, which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints, some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle, and they let you bend here and here. I don't have one of those with me today, but those are usually fine, too. But if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist, you should be able to eliminate that catching and popping. The goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping. Some people think that if they grip a ball, they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there. But that's not the case. And in fact, that can make it worse. So you want to avoid the clicking and popping, and this ring can really help that. So it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still should be able to hold an onion if you've got a cut. You should still be able to do some laundry. You should still be able to blow dry your hair. It's not going to affect your function as much as a really big splint would. Now, I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time. Now, you can take it off at nighttime as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fist when you're sleeping. Because then when you wake up, you may notice, oh, no, it's back to where it was. When you take the splint off, if the joint feels very stiff, what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff. So notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand. I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area. If you want to try the oval eight splint to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger, I think this could help you. Four to six weeks is going to be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your finger. And hopefully that trigger finger has gone away. I would slowly wean yourself out of that, basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities.

The video has some clear aims related to explaining what an oval eight splint is and how it can help alleviate symptoms of trigger finger. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront and have to be inferred from the content. The video covers the purpose, sizing, and usage instructions for the oval eight splint in managing trigger finger symptoms like clicking, popping, and locking of the finger joints. It also mentions the expected timeline for improvement and briefly touches upon post-surgical care. While the main topic is reasonably clear, a more explicit statement of the aims at the beginning would have made the purpose more apparent to the viewer."," 4

The video partially achieves its aims of providing information on how the oval eight splint can help with trigger finger. While it explains the purpose and mechanism of the splint in detail, it lacks comprehensive information on trigger finger itself, its causes, symptoms, and alternative treatments. The video acknowledges that it is not primarily about trigger finger but focuses more on the splint's usage. However, it does provide some background on trigger finger and recommends consulting a doctor for diagnosis. Overall, it fulfills its primary goal of explaining the splint's functionality for trigger finger but falls short in providing a complete overview of the condition itself."," 4

The video provides relevant information about treating trigger finger using an oval-eight splint. It explains how the splint works by limiting the bending motion of the affected finger, which can help alleviate the catching or locking sensation associated with trigger finger. The video also offers advice on proper usage, such as wearing the splint for 4-6 weeks, taking it off at night if not clenching the fist, and gently moving the joint to prevent stiffness.

However, the video lacks comprehensive information on the causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of trigger finger, as acknowledged by the presenter. It primarily focuses on the splint as a treatment option, leaving out other potential treatments or more in-depth medical information about the condition itself. Therefore, while the information provided is relevant for those seeking a specific treatment option, it may not fully address all the questions readers might have about trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The transcript mentions some general sources of information, but does not provide specific references for the main claims or statements made in the video. While the video briefly mentions that a doctor should diagnose trigger finger, it does not cite any research studies or expert opinions as evidence for the information provided about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of trigger finger using the oval-8 splint. The sources of information are partially clear, but specific references are lacking for the key points discussed."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date mentioned is the recommended duration of 4-6 weeks for wearing the splint to alleviate trigger finger symptoms. There are no specific dates given for any studies, research papers, or other sources referenced in the video. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that the information is partially clear in terms of when the sources were produced."," 3

Explanation: The video presents some useful information about using an oval splint to help manage trigger finger, but it has a few biases and limitations. While it mentions consulting a doctor for diagnosis, it heavily promotes the use of this specific product without objectively comparing it to other treatment options like steroid injections, surgery, or other splint designs. The information seems to come primarily from the presenter's personal experience rather than citing multiple research studies or experts. The language used is also somewhat promotional in nature, encouraging viewers to purchase the product. However, it does provide some balanced advice, such as gently moving the joint to prevent stiffness. Overall, while the video offers potentially helpful tips, it lacks a fully objective and well-rounded perspective on trigger finger treatment."," 2

Explanation: The video partially provides details of additional sources of support and information. While it mentions that more information can be found by following a link below, it does not explicitly provide the link or details about the organization/website. The information seems to be limited to the same organization (Virtual Hand Care) offering additional resources online. There are no specific suggestions for further reading or details about other organizations providing advice and information related to the topic of trigger finger."," 5

The video clearly discusses areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for trigger finger. The speaker mentions that while the oval-eight splint can help prevent the catching or popping associated with trigger finger, there are other types of splints available that may work differently (e.g., blocking motion at the knuckle joint instead of just preventing a full fist). The speaker also acknowledges that the splint may cause some joint stiffness and recommends gentle exercises to mitigate this potential side effect. Additionally, the speaker notes that the typical treatment duration of 4-6 weeks with the splint is an estimate, implying that individual results may vary. Overall, the video presents the oval-eight splint as one treatment option while acknowledging other choices and uncertainties in the treatment approach and outcomes."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how the oval eight splint works to treat trigger finger. It explains that the splint prevents full bending of the finger, which avoids the catching or popping motion that causes irritation of the tendon and inflammation. However, the details on the underlying mechanism of trigger finger itself (swelling of the tendon sheath, difficulty passing through the pulley) are somewhat unclear or incomplete. The video does not go into detail about how other potential treatments like surgery or other splints work. Overall, it covers the mechanism of action for the specific oval eight splint reasonably well but lacks comprehensive details on trigger finger treatments in general."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the oval eight splint treatment for trigger finger. It explains that the splint helps prevent the catching, popping, and locking of the finger joint caused by trigger finger by limiting the full bending motion that triggers the symptoms. It also mentions that wearing the splint for 4-6 weeks can help reduce inflammation and potentially eliminate the trigger finger condition. However, the video does not explicitly discuss the benefits of any other treatments for trigger finger besides briefly mentioning that some splints block bending at the knuckle joint. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as it describes the benefits of one treatment but not all potential treatments."," 2

The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with using the oval eight splint for treating trigger finger. It mentions that keeping the joint immobilized for an extended period by wearing the splint continuously can lead to stiffness in that joint. The video suggests gently moving the joint when taking off the splint to prevent excessive stiffness. However, it does not explicitly mention any other risks, side effects, or potential complications associated with using the splint or leaving trigger finger untreated. The focus is primarily on explaining how the splint works to alleviate the symptoms of trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks and benefits of not treating trigger finger or postponing treatment. It mentions that avoiding the clicking, popping, and catching motions that cause inflammation and irritation of the tendon is important, and that the splint can help prevent those motions. This implies that not preventing those motions by using a splint or other treatment could worsen the condition. However, the video does not explicitly state the risks of permanently forgoing treatment or the benefits of watchful waiting/monitoring the condition's progression without treatment. The information provided about not treating or postponing treatment is somewhat incomplete."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes how the treatment choice of using an oval eight splint affects overall quality of life. It mentions that the splint allows for light activities such as holding an onion, doing laundry, or blow-drying hair, suggesting that it does not significantly impair day-to-day activities. However, the information on the impact on quality of life is limited and not discussed in detail. The video primarily focuses on explaining how the splint works to alleviate trigger finger symptoms rather than comprehensively addressing its effects on overall quality of life."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It suggests using the oval-eight splint as a treatment option and mentions that it may help alleviate the symptoms of trigger finger over a period of 4-6 weeks. However, the video does not provide a detailed description of who is most likely to benefit from this treatment or under what circumstances it would be the preferred choice. It also does not clearly suggest any alternative treatment options to consider or investigate further. The video primarily focuses on promoting and explaining the use of the oval-eight splint, without presenting a comprehensive discussion of various treatment choices and their suitability for different cases."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the video encourages consulting a doctor to get a proper diagnosis for trigger finger, it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment options or making shared decisions with healthcare professionals. The focus is primarily on explaining the use of an oval-eight splint as a potential treatment option. There is a brief mention of considering surgery if other methods fail, but no emphasis on discussing this or other treatment choices with doctors or loved ones. Overall, the video offers some useful information but lacks a clear promotion of shared decision-making regarding trigger finger treatment.",set()
c0X9E9AeSUQ,"By the end of this video you're going to learn how to fix trigger finger in about five minutes. My name is Dr. Storey. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience and the scientific literature. Now trigger finger is a situation where you start to develop adhesions inside the tendon. So the tendon has a sheath that will slide and if adhesions and scar tissue build up around that tendon you're going to get lots of problems. The finger will start to pull down. You won't be able to stretch it. Some people will get like a snapping finger. It can happen in any finger but most commonly it's of the ring finger. Now there are three steps to getting rid of this problem and if it doesn't help then you have to go another route which I'll tell you at the end of the video. Number one you're going to do Graston technique. You need to find a practitioner who knows what they're doing. It's usually a chiropractor in your area and by the use of special Graston tools they're able to essentially break down the scar tissue in and around that tendon sheath and if you're able to remove the scar tissue which is essentially the cause of the problem then you're going to have a lot better results with the other procedures I'm going to talk about. The second thing that you can do to help with trigger finger is using heat and stretching. By applying a heating pad to your hand for about 10 minutes and then stretching the actual tendon you can have really good results in allowing that scar tissue to not develop and actually slide. So the way you would stretch the trigger finger is I would go behind the hand grab the actual finger and start bending it just as I'm doing right here. Then you start to dorsiflex or extend your wrist and then what you can do is fully extend your elbow and holding that position for about two minutes is what's required to get the most amount of benefit from the stretching. Now should you stretch for 30 seconds? This is a common question. The answer is no. Two minutes is the amount that's required in order for your brain to understand the stretch reflex and allow the tissue to actually mold and change. Number three wear a splint at night. Very often patients will have problems with their trigger finger at nighttime because they're not moving it around. So if you can get a splint to help you so that it won't it won't get to be a problem at nighttime you'll sleep a lot better. I'm going to put a link down below. I'm an Amazon affiliate so I do get a small commission for it but we can have this special brace and splint sent to your door so you can start using it right away. Now sometimes these procedures that I just mentioned do not work and the reason why is if you wait too long for this problem to develop sometimes you're just quite frankly too late to the party. If there's too much scar tissue, if it's been around for too long, these self-help procedures may not actually work. If that's the case then you only have one other option and that option is you're going to have to go to a hand surgeon. Very likely they will try a series of cortisone shots into the actual tendon to reduce any inflammation and very often that irritation of just putting the needle in can actually stimulate the healing of that. The problem is that has a very poor success rate for the most part. The last procedure that they can use is surgery to actually release that tendon and I have had many patients that have had ended up having that surgery and sure enough a year and a half, two years later the problem comes right back. So it's not the greatest solution. You want to get to this problem earlier. The sooner you can treat it with Graston, the sooner you can treat it with stretching and the sooner you can get that brace and splint on your finger, the better off you're going to be. So if you have any questions regarding this and you'd like to talk to me personally about your situation, we are offering zoom appointments.

The video has clear aims. The narrator states the aims explicitly at the beginning: ""By the end of this video you're going to learn how to fix trigger finger in about five minutes."" The video then proceeds to outline three steps for treating trigger finger: Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint at night. It also mentions surgery as a last resort if the other methods fail. The aims of providing advice on treating trigger finger are clearly conveyed."," 4

Explanation: The video partially achieves its aim of teaching how to fix trigger finger in about five minutes. While it provides detailed information on the three recommended steps (Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint at night), it also discusses additional options such as seeking help from a hand surgeon and getting cortisone shots or surgery if the self-help methods do not work. However, the video goes beyond just outlining how to fix trigger finger and provides background information on the condition itself, which was not explicitly stated as part of the aim. Overall, the video covers the outlined aim reasonably well but also includes some additional information."," 4

The video transcript provides relevant information about trigger finger, its causes, and various treatment options. It covers self-help techniques like Graston technique, heat and stretching exercises, and wearing a splint at night. It also discusses the potential need for medical intervention, such as cortisone shots or surgery, if the self-help methods are ineffective.

However, the information is presented in a somewhat promotional manner, with the doctor mentioning his website, consultations, and an Amazon affiliate link for a splint. Additionally, some aspects, like the specific stretching duration and the likelihood of surgery being ineffective in the long run, could benefit from more elaboration or supporting evidence.

Overall, the video addresses many of the key questions readers might have regarding trigger finger and its management, making it partially to largely relevant, hence the score of 4."," 2

The video provides some references to sources of evidence, but they are not clearly cited or detailed. The transcript mentions ""the scientific literature"" and ""realistic advice based on my experience,"" but it does not provide specific citations or references for the claims made. The stretching technique is described as being based on the ""stretch reflex"" and the brain's understanding of it, but no source is cited for this claim. Additionally, while the Graston technique and the use of a splint are mentioned as recommended treatments, there are no references provided to support their effectiveness. Overall, while some general sources are alluded to, the lack of clear and specific citations for the main claims and recommendations reduces the transparency of the sources used."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides no clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. The only date mentioned is implicitly the date of the video itself, as it is presented as current advice from the speaker, Dr. Storey. However, there are no specific dates provided for any scientific literature, studies, or other sources that may have informed the advice and information shared in the video. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the score is 2 (Partially), as only the date of the video itself is clear, but no dates are given for acknowledged sources."," 3

Explanation: The video provides a balanced overview of various treatment options for trigger finger, including non-surgical options like Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint, as well as surgical options like cortisone shots and tendon release surgery. However, the information is presented from a personal point of view, with the host heavily promoting his own services and products (e.g., Zoom appointments, affiliate links to splints). There is also a lack of clear references to specific research studies or expert sources, with the host primarily relying on his own experience and anecdotal evidence. While the video covers multiple treatment options, the biased promotion of personal services and lack of objective research references reduce its overall balance and impartiality."," 2

Explanation: The video partially provides details of additional sources of support and information. It mentions that viewers can contact the speaker (Dr. Storey) personally for a Zoom or telephone consultation, and provides his website and contact information. However, it does not suggest any other external sources of information or organizations related to the topic of trigger finger. The only additional source mentioned is a link to purchase a splint on Amazon, for which the speaker is an affiliate. Therefore, the video receives a score of 2 for providing some additional sources, but limited to the speaker's own services and an affiliate product."," 3

Explanation: The video partially refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for trigger finger. While it discusses various treatment options, such as Graston technique, heat and stretching, splinting, cortisone shots, and surgery, the discussion on the uncertainties or gaps in knowledge is limited. The video mentions that surgery may not be the best solution as the problem can recur after a year or two, implying some uncertainty about its effectiveness. However, there is no explicit discussion or acknowledgment of uncertainties or differences in expert opinion concerning other treatment choices. The information provided is somewhat incomplete in terms of addressing the gaps in knowledge or expert disagreements surrounding the various treatment options."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details on how the recommended treatments (Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint) work to address trigger finger, but the explanations are relatively brief and lack in-depth physiological or mechanistic details. For example, it explains that Graston technique helps break down scar tissue around the tendon sheath, and that stretching and heat prevent further scar tissue formation and improve tendon gliding. However, it does not delve into the specific mechanisms by which these treatments achieve their effects on the tissues involved. The descriptions remain somewhat superficial. Additionally, the video does not provide any details on how potential further treatments like cortisone injections or surgery work. Therefore, a score of 3 (Partially) is appropriate, as some treatments are explained in terms of their effects, but the descriptions lack comprehensive mechanistic details."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for trigger finger. It highlights that Graston technique helps break down scar tissue around the tendon sheath, which is the cause of the problem. Heat and stretching are described as allowing the scar tissue to not develop and the tendon to slide better. Wearing a splint at night is mentioned to prevent the finger from getting stuck in a bent position while sleeping. However, the video does not explicitly state the benefits of cortisone shots or surgery, which are presented as options if the other treatments fail. It only mentions that cortisone shots have a poor success rate, and surgery may lead to recurrence of the problem after some time."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments for trigger finger. While it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects for the self-help treatments (Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint), it does mention the potential complications and drawbacks of the medical treatments, such as the poor success rate of cortisone shots and the possibility of the problem recurring after surgery. However, it does not provide any specific details about the potential risks or adverse reactions associated with these medical treatments. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as it partially addresses the risks for some but not all of the treatments discussed."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or benefits of not treating trigger finger. It mentions that if the self-help procedures (Graston technique, stretching, and splinting) do not work, the only remaining option is surgery by a hand surgeon. The transcript also warns that if the problem is left untreated for too long, the self-help procedures may not work, and surgery may be required. However, there is no clear description of the specific risks or benefits of postponing treatment or permanently forgoing treatment. The information provided about not treating the condition is incomplete."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any information regarding how the described treatment choices for trigger finger (Graston technique, heat/stretching, splinting, cortisone injections, or surgery) affect overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The transcript focuses solely on describing the treatment options themselves and does not discuss their potential impact on the patient's overall well-being or ability to perform daily tasks. There is no reference to the effects of the treatments on quality of life or daily functioning."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It suggests three initial treatment options: Graston technique, heat and stretching, and wearing a splint at night. However, it does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment or under what specific circumstances each treatment should be chosen. The video also mentions that if these initial treatments do not work, the remaining options are cortisone shots or surgery, but it does not provide much detail on when these more invasive treatments would be appropriate or recommended over the other choices. Overall, while the video acknowledges different treatment possibilities, the information is somewhat unclear and incomplete in terms of guiding the selection of the most suitable treatment for an individual case."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the video mentions the option of consulting a hand surgeon for more severe cases and getting cortisone shots or surgery, it does not explicitly encourage discussing treatment choices with family, friends, or healthcare professionals. The focus is primarily on self-help techniques like Graston technique, stretching, and splinting. The video could have provided stronger support for shared decision-making by emphasizing the importance of consulting with healthcare professionals, considering individual circumstances, and weighing the pros and cons of different treatment options in collaboration with others.",set()
UVR865Fhq1w,"This is David Drake, I'm going to review a case of A1 pulling release on the thumb. Typically this is done with a transverse incision, overlying the nodule. A nodule is usually easily palpable in the flexor crease at the base of the thumb. A 1cm incision is then marked out and made with a 15 blade. Once the skin is in a deeper section, it is accomplished with a spreading technique. The flexor tendon lays beneath this area as does the additional nerve. This is easily identified in this video and kept out of harm's way. Once the sheath is identified, it is opened using a 15 blade. In this case we excised a portion of the sheath. I don't always do that. It depends on the nature of the sheath and the construction. In this case the sheath was quite thick and was causing some difficulty. We had free range of motion at the conclusion of sheath excision. No catching nor nodule was seen on the tendon. Closure was accomplished with interrupted monofilament suture, usually in a mattress fashion to avert these thick skin edges. The patient is given instructions to begin moving immediately and is not restricted from motion until day one. Sutures come out in two weeks. No splinters used, just a light dressing.",Trigger Finger,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0," 3

JtqGbwJAAVU,"Trigger finger is a common painful hand condition that results in locking of a finger when the patient makes a fist. The following video demonstrates a surgical procedure called trigger finger release. The surgery is typically performed under an injection of local anesthetic. A rubber band is applied to the hand and wrist, and a tourniquet stops any bleeding so that the important structures can be easily visualized in surgery. A diagonal incision is made on the palm. The tissues are gently dissected. Retractors help to protect the important nerve and vessel branches. This is a transverse sling called a pulley. When it becomes inflamed, it constricts the flexor tendon. Incising the pulley with a scalpel and scissors releases the flexor tendon. The flexor tendon is pulled up from the incision and inspected. There is no more triggering or locking when the tendon is pulled. Passive flexion and extension of the finger is unimpeded. The patient also flexes and extends the finger, and there is completely normal movement of the affected finger. Previous triggering no longer exists and is not palpable. Triggering usually does not recur after the release. The incision is closed with two or three stitches. The hand is wrapped in a light bandage. There are almost no restrictions after the surgery, except for keeping the bandages clean and dry for two days. After removal of the bandage, the hand can be washed. The stitches are removed in 10 days. People usually return to office-type work the day after the surgery.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0," 5

20Wkyvzdm5s,"Hi, I'm trying to stay with my promise here, to show the aftermath, show this process of having a trigger finger repaired. I had the surgery yesterday and it took about 35 minutes, probably 3 hours of getting prepared and being released and stuff like that. I convinced them to let me watch the surgery through the entire procedure and it's truly an amazing thing. This is, just so anyone knows, this is what the aftermath will look like for 6 days or so. And then I can remove this and have the stitches out and start doing hopefully some things with my fingers. This was the trigger finger and I can already actually bend it. I don't feel the catching of the trigger finger anymore. So who knows what will happen as it heals but as of this point it seems positive. I quickly described the surgery where I saw and let go of that I think for now. They cut a, probably a half inch hole in my hand and it's by a node where the tendons are going through this node to get to this finger here. So this decision is essentially right there. And then they use some forks to stretch out the skin wide enough so that they can pull out the tendons and operate on them. The tendons are incredible looking things like the most perfect rubber bands, pure white rubber bands. They have a very strong feeling. They pulled them out and stretched them so that they pretty much filled my palm with those two tendons going through the finger. So they had these two tendons out, stretched apart, perhaps two inches apart with what felt like a huge amount of tension on them. And there was obviously a lot of growth over the years that occurred on those tendons that was causing this problem. The tendons were cut off and scraped off and disposed of. And then this little myelin sheath, which is just like an eyelet on a fishing rod or something, at least metaphorically, was slit so that there would be more room I think in case there was more regrowth or something. I was able to test the finger while I was in the midst of this, when it was done actually. So I made a complete fist. It seemed like it was the first time I had been able to move the finger in a month I guess. Anyway, this morning is utterly miserable. You know, this astounding amount of pain in my fingers are just now really becoming unknown. You know, because there's a lot of local anesthetic involved in this thing. Even that wasn't really enough to keep the pain from being there, but it worked well enough. And I thought the surgeon was really good in terms of explaining things while he was doing them and allowing me to see this in the first place I guess. Usually this is a, whatever it's called, the Michael Jackson probe, propofol or something, type of operation where you're out cold. So that's the deal. I hope to be playing pretty soon. I don't think it's going to be one of these two-day things, but even this just gets in my way. But I think that when this comes off that it won't be long and that will be pretty much my PT is typing, playing, and the million other things that I do. Although just to start with I'll be doing things like this. That's it. See you around. That's easy to turn this off. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",Trigger Finger,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 2

I7svkSrtW5I,"Here you can see the anatomy of a normal, uninjured thumb. The synovial tendon sheath and the tendon are clearly shown. Inflammation of the tendon sheath is known as stenosing tinosinovitis. Stenosing tinosinovitis of the thumb, often referred to as trigger thumb, is one of the more common abnormalities of the hand. This condition is associated with painful triggering or locking of the thumb. When the patient tries to straighten the thumb, the nodule jams beneath the pulley proximally. This occurs with a painful snap, much like a trigger being pulled and released, with either flexion or extension of the thumb. Small changes in the tendon's diameter will have a significant effect on the function of the thumb. The nodule is usually pulled proximally to the pulley with active thumb flexion. That includes anti-inflammatory medication and injection. Inject into the sheath, not the tendon. Put the needle obliquely towards the tendon. Withdraw the needle slightly and inject freely into the sheath. Ultrasound guided injection of the tendon sheath and pulley may be of benefit. The needle is inserted into the sheath above the tendon and fluid is injected. If symptoms persist, consider surgery. Release the pulley to allow active motion without triggering. Note the position of the radial digital nerve close to the incision. Everything seems to be fine with this thumb, but there's definitely something tricky going on with this one.

I'm also a cancer survivor and I used to suffer from chronic migraines, headaches, pain and fatigue before I invented ASTR specialty. Tell me what's going on with your fingers. So I just had this locking trigger finger for the last 6 months and it's where you have to pull it open manually now and there's no grip left. When you go to grab something it's just like… It's just stuck here, you see that? So it's stuck, he's not able to. So you have to, and this one too, but that's open, you see? It's not as bad but it still pops. It pops but here, are you trying to open it by yourself? Yeah he's trying. You can relax your hand. Let's bring it this way. Can you see that? Try to open this one. It's just stuck. You see the shakiness of his hand? Okay let's do the same thing here. Try to open it. Here you go, he's able to open it here but it's very slow but here it's just totally stuck. So it took 6 months this has been going on. Of it that bad yeah. Is that all the time or is it worse at certain times of the day? It's pretty much the same all day. It might be a little bit worse in the morning. So how much pain do you feel there at worse from 0 to 10? Probably about an 8. Sometimes up to a 9 it can be really painful. You can see it's stuck all the time. The only way to straighten it is to use the other hand to do that. Manually yeah. You have to pull it out. It feels like it pops up in there too. It sort of scares me to pull it out. Have you had any treatment for this before? Not yet no. So let's see because you were saying how many fingers totally have trigger fingers? This one doesn't do it too bad but the middle finger on these two will pop. This is the worst one. This is the worst by far. The left ring finger and the right middle finger. It's starting to lock too. So we're going to work. Let's start with this. Make sure whatever we do is not painful. We're back. We had an issue with the memory card so we could not get the recording for the treatment. The treatment was like 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this is recording now. If you see it, yes it's recording. Give me an update after working on it. Let's go back to what was difficult for you to do and what you had to do to unlock your finger. Well before, especially in the mornings when I wake up, I tend to sleep on my hands sometimes but it would always be locked. You would have to pry the thing open and whenever I would be working out, I would have to pull my finger off the weights because it would wrap itself around it. And it's stuck? Yeah it's stuck completely. Now it's hanging up and it's not sticking. Nowhere near as bad as it used to. So before you manually have to do this. Yeah it actually locked and there was a popping going on under the skin and everything too. There's still a pop but it doesn't take near the effort to get it out. I don't have to manually pull it anymore and it will go on its own. So what do you think about ASTR treatment working out in a few minutes? I think it's awesome. Very beneficial. Yeah. Alright. I'm happy with it. Thank you. So you feel the difference. How long has this been going on really severe? It's been locking to where I have to manually open it up for about the last 6 months. For about 6 months. And now it's doing its own thing. Yeah awesome. These are like my tools in life. Well you left or right handed? Left handed. So you set a lot of down? Yeah this is my predominant hand. Yeah I'm glad you're doing better. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Feel free to subscribe to my channel to get helpful tips on how to relieve pain.

iKjPKT5sHkw,"Hello this is Dr. Janusz. Today we're going to be watching a trigger thumb release. Surgery starts with incision marking. This is done with a skin marker. I'm feeling around here for the A1 pulley which is right below the skin. You can feel that on your own thumb is a little pea sized bump. In people who have a trigger thumb it's significantly larger and more inflamed. Notice now that I'm testing the anesthetic making sure that the hand is completely numb. The anesthesiologist is confirming that the patient is comfortable prior to incision. At this point during the surgery we wrap the arm with an esmerc tourniquet. This exsanguinates all the blood from the arm and there's a blood pressure cuff up on the upper part of the arm that acts as a tourniquet during the rest of the surgery that was just inflated. The skin is incised with a 15 blade scalpel being extremely careful to protect sensory nerves immediately below the skin. Once the skin is completely incised, dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried down through to the level of the A1 pulley with scissors and forceps. The sensory nerves are immediately identified and the dissection is carried out so that the nerves are protected for the rest of the surgery. There's quite a few blood vessels in this area and those are cauterized with bipolar cauteri. We do have to be careful of the arteries feeding the thumb and those are protected during this time. The sensory nerves are immediately separated by the blood vessels. At this time I am cleaning off some of the dense attachments to the A1 pulley. The A1 pulley is a very thick fiber structure that goes right over the top of the flexor tendon. This helps curl your thumb down. It also keeps the tendon in place so that it doesn't bowstring the skin. This particular patient's had a very long-standing trigger thumb and there's dense adhesions immediately over the A1 pulley that I'm trying to clean off in order to fully divide the pulley. I'm now using what's called a freer elevator and I'm using this to gently push off the rest of the fibrous tissue to fully see the A1 pulley. Behind the retractor you see is one of the digital nerves that I'm having my assistant protect during the entire day of surgery. Now I'm using a beaver blade to divide the pulley. You can now see the pulley in my forceps. It has the consistency of thick leather. Now I'm trying to look just a little bit further to make sure that the entire pulley has been released. There's one small band that I'll catch with my scissors and spread apart. Lastly I like to pull the tendon up a little bit to make sure that it's free from any scarring or fine attachments. Then check mobility of the thumb. At this point I feel no clicking or catching of the thumb and the thumb is moving freely and smooth. Sometimes at this point in the surgery we'll actually ask the patient to move their finger or thumb, whatever we're operating on, and make sure that the patient doesn't perceive any actual clicking or triggering as they did prior to surgery. This particular patient asked for a bit more anesthetic and was sleeping through the surgery so they were unable to participate in that. Now we're closing the wound with some nylon suture. We've sped this up slightly because it does take a bit of time to put in a nice closure and is somewhat monotonous to watch. You'll notice that this suture line is somewhat raised as I'm putting it in where the skin edges are abutted together. That's actually done intentionally and it allows the skin to heal better and create less of a scar. At the end of the surgery we're not going to show you the placement of the dressing because this patient actually went on to have a second surgery which is also going to be found on this particular site. So that's the end of this surgery. Thanks for watching and we hope you learned a little bit about trigger thumbs.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0," 5

RKE8LESi83o,"Trigger finger is a condition that often causes locking of any finger of the hand. Most commonly, trigger finger affects the ring finger and the thumb. It's also called synosyntinosynovitis, but it's obviously easier to call it trigger finger. What happens in this condition is the tendons that allow us to move our hands like this actually get stuck, so to speak, in the sheath, the covering of the tendon, or basically the tunnel that they have to travel through in order for us to be able to move our fingers freely. A lot of times this occurs in people that use their hands a lot, and trigger finger might develop just from simple overuse. Typically, if a patient with trigger finger were to go see their doctor, they might be recommended to get a steroid shot to decrease the inflammation of the tendon and the sheath and allow everything to move more freely. In theory, that sounds nice, but the reality is that steroid shots actually increase risk of tendon rupture, which is why people are limited to the number of steroid shots that they could get each year. And people with trigger finger a lot of times may undergo a steroid shot only to find that everything just really comes right back sometime later. Maybe they get a second steroid shot, the same thing happens, and then eventually they're recommended for surgery. What we do is oftentimes a combination of what we call a hydrodissection procedure along with prolotherapy. And what that involves is using a non-steroid injection actually into that tendon sheath to draw off swelling, kind of unstick any adhesions that might be there from chronic overuse, and allow that tendon to move more freely through that tunnel. Prolotherapy may also be warranted in these cases because a lot of times what we see is, let's say someone has trigger finger of their ring finger, it often goes hand in hand with injury, arthritis, or things to any of these joints along the path of that tendon. And so by doing a hydrodissection procedure to kind of free up that tendon in that tunnel, and then also doing prolotherapy to strengthen any joint or fix any injury in these fingers, those procedures work really well hand in hand to get trigger finger to resolve.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0," 4

bF-F6pGVOyI,"Trigger finger is caused by a swollen tendon, your flexor tendon, that allows your finger to bend. Trigger finger is a form of tendonitis and it can happen from overuse or spontaneously out of the blue. Sometimes the issue will resolve spontaneously on its own. For the other cases we have several treatment options for trigger finger. Oral or topical anti-inflammatories are a good first option to treat conservatively. You can also try a nighttime splint for your finger to alleviate pain. The splint helps keep your finger straight at night while you sleep. Cortisone injections are also an option and are roughly 50% effective in treating trigger finger. Lastly, some cases of trigger finger require surgical release. Surgical release for a trigger finger is an outpatient procedure which means you can go home the same day. The surgery is performed for a small incision which typically takes about two weeks to heal. The total recovery period after surgery is three to four weeks during which time most patients experience some soreness or stiffness. After about a month you should be able to go back to your normal activities without the pain of your trigger finger.

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger, including its causes, treatment options, and recovery process. It covers various conservative treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications, splinting, and cortisone injections, as well as surgical intervention when necessary. The description of the surgical procedure and post-operative recovery timeline is also included. However, the video does not delve into the risk factors, prevention strategies, or long-term prognosis of trigger finger, which could have further enhanced the information provided. Overall, the transcript achieves its aims of outlining the condition and its management reasonably well, although some additional details could have made it more comprehensive."," 4

Explanation: The transcript provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger, including its causes, symptoms, and various treatment options. It covers both non-surgical treatments like anti-inflammatory medications, splints, and cortisone injections, as well as surgical release as a last resort. The information is relevant and addresses common questions that readers might have regarding trigger finger and its management. However, it lacks specific details on risk factors, prevention strategies, and potential complications, which could be helpful for some readers. Overall, the transcript is highly relevant but not exhaustive."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some general information about trigger finger, its causes, and treatment options, but it does not explicitly cite or reference any specific sources of information or evidence. The information seems to be based on the author's own knowledge or expertise, but there are no references provided to support the claims or statements made. Therefore, I would rate the clarity of sources as a partial score of 2, as the sources of evidence are not clearly mentioned or referenced in the transcript."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date mentioned is in relation to the recovery period after surgery, which is not a source of information but rather a potential treatment outcome. While the video itself may have a production date, the lack of dates for the underlying sources of information makes it difficult to assess the timeliness and relevance of the content. As a result, the score is a 2, indicating that only the date of the video itself is potentially clear, but the dates for the acknowledged sources are not provided."," 4

The transcript presents a balanced overview of the potential treatment options for trigger finger, including conservative treatments such as anti-inflammatories and splinting, as well as more invasive options like cortisone injections and surgery. However, it lacks specific details on the potential risks, success rates, or comparative effectiveness of these treatments. The information is presented in a straightforward manner without sensationalism or personal bias, but it also does not reference specific research studies or expert sources beyond mentioning the provider's expertise. Overall, while the information is generally objective and covers a range of treatment choices, the lack of detailed evidence or sources makes it only partially balanced and unbiased."," 1

The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information beyond the treatment options discussed by the medical provider. It does not suggest further reading materials or mention other organizations that could provide advice and information about trigger finger. The transcript solely focuses on explaining the condition and the available treatment options offered by the medical provider's organization (UCHealth)."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for trigger finger. It mentions that ""sometimes the issue will resolve spontaneously on its own,"" indicating uncertainty about whether treatment is necessary in some cases. Additionally, it discusses several treatment options, including oral or topical anti-inflammatories, nighttime splints, cortisone injections (which are ""roughly 50% effective""), and surgical release. The presentation of multiple treatment options implies that there is no single definitive treatment, and the choice of treatment may depend on individual circumstances or expert opinion. The video provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment choices while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the most appropriate course of action."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how some of the treatments work, but it lacks details on the mechanisms of action for others. While it mentions that anti-inflammatories can help treat trigger finger conservatively, it does not explain how they work to reduce inflammation. Similarly, the description of the surgical release procedure focuses on the practicalities of the surgery rather than how it addresses the underlying issue of the swollen tendon. However, the transcript does provide some insight into the rationale for using a nighttime splint, stating that it helps keep the finger straight at night. Overall, the information provided is incomplete, warranting a score of 3."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments for trigger finger. It mentions that anti-inflammatories, splinting, and cortisone injections are options to treat the condition conservatively, implying that they can alleviate symptoms. For surgery, it states that it can eliminate the trigger finger condition, allowing patients to return to normal activities without pain after recovery. However, the video does not explicitly mention the benefits of preventing recurrence or any long-term benefits for the non-surgical treatments."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks associated with the treatments for trigger finger. It mentions that cortisone injections are ""roughly 50% effective,"" implying a risk of ineffectiveness. It also notes that surgery involves a small incision, a recovery period of 3-4 weeks, and potential soreness or stiffness during recovery, which can be considered risks or complications. However, it does not explicitly mention any risks or side effects associated with oral or topical anti-inflammatories or nighttime splinting. Therefore, it partially covers the risks for some but not all of the treatments mentioned."," 2

Explanation: The transcript mentions that ""Sometimes the issue will resolve spontaneously on its own,"" which implies that one option is to wait and see if the condition resolves without treatment. However, it does not provide any details on the risks or benefits associated with this ""watchful waiting"" approach. The transcript focuses primarily on describing various treatment options rather than the consequences of forgoing treatment. Therefore, the information provided regarding the no-treatment option is incomplete, warranting a score of 2 (Partially)."," 2

Explanation: The transcript mentions some potential effects of the treatment choices on day-to-day activities, but the information is limited and lacks clarity. It states that after surgical release, ""most patients experience some soreness or stiffness"" during the 3-4 week recovery period, implying some impact on daily activities. However, it does not provide details on how the other treatment options (anti-inflammatories, splinting, or cortisone injections) may affect quality of life or daily activities. The information provided is incomplete and lacks specifics regarding the overall impact of the various treatment choices on quality of life and daily functioning."," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It mentions several treatment options, including oral or topical anti-inflammatories, nighttime splinting, cortisone injections, and surgical release. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one treatment might be preferred over another. It does mention that surgery is an option for some cases and that cortisone injections are roughly 50% effective, but it lacks more detailed guidance on selecting the appropriate treatment based on individual factors."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by mentioning various treatment options for trigger finger, including oral or topical anti-inflammatories, nighttime splinting, cortisone injections, and surgical release. It also mentions that the healthcare provider can help evaluate the case and guide the patient towards the right treatment plan. However, the video does not explicitly suggest discussing these options with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals, nor does it encourage the patient's active involvement in the decision-making process.

c-fDxviyeIk,"BraceAbility is introducing a brand new solution for trigger finger and trigger thumb pain. You might have trigger finger if: Your finger feels stiff or tender, especially in the morning. Your finger pops or clicks when you move it. Or, your finger locks in a bent position and you can't straighten it. The tendons in your fingers are surrounded by sheaths, which protect them and keep them lubricated so your fingers can move. Repetitive hand motions like gripping, can damage this part of your tendon and make it inflamed or swollen. Then, it can't move through the sheath. This is trigger finger. BraceAbility's new rigid splint prevents your finger from bending into that position where it could catch or lock while still allowing the rest of your hand to move freely. The soft padding makes it comfortable to wear day or night, on any finger or your thumb, and one size fits all. With the nylon side facing up, lay your finger over the brace so the splint is directed down towards your palm. Fasten the top of the ""T"" so it rests between the base of your finger and your knuckle, where you would wear a ring. Then, tighten the Velcro strap to your desired comfort level.

V0FfMzemLnU,"- Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist. - Brad Heineck, physical therapist. - And together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion, of course, Bob. - Pay attention. Today we're gonna talk about the top three ways to treat trigger finger. Trigger finger, by the way, is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain. Generally the biggest sign of it is you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open. - Okay. - It might give you a little bit of pain. - So when you say overuse, give me an example. - If you're like working on the garden, and you're using a clipper. - Okay. And you clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, that would do it, a lot of industrial jobs. - Factory type work? - Right, where you're using the hand over and over again. - Yep. - Very common in older women who are menopausal. - Oh, really? - Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit the group that tends to get it. - Because of the calcium issues? - I have no idea, Brad. - Okay. - But it very commonly affects the thumb, the ring finger, and the middle finger. - Okay. - But it can happen in any finger, and it can happen really at almost any joint. - Okay. - Should we try to explain this, Brad? - Sure. - Just real quickly? - Let's just use our model here with Leopold. - Napoleon, bone apart. - Napoleon. - All right, we have a long ligament here, ligaments that run up into your finger here. And when you pull on them, they actually bend the finger. - Right. So the muscle is up here. When the muscle contracts, the tendon... Now every finger would have this red tendon, but they're not red in your body. But if you look at the tendon- - There's actually two tendons that actually even go through there. - Yeah. So if you look at that finger... - See how it's bending it? When he pulls on the rope, it bends it. - Look at that. - Yeah. - It goes much easier in real life, of course. - And these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament. - Yeah. - It's an annular ligament, and you actually call it a pulley. And that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place. - This a very crude model. - This is very crude. And what we are trying to show right here is a nodule. A nodule has developed on the tendon, and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. - So right there you can see it goes underneath the ligament, and then that's where it gets caught. And that's when you straighten the finger, that's when it pops out. - It pops out. Yep, simple as that. So a little bit difficult to understand, but generally if you have trigger finger at this finger right here, you're gonna feel a nodule right here, quite often. - Okay. - So the first treatment you're gonna do is what we call cross fiber massage, or transverse friction massage. Basically, you're gonna find that nodule in this whole area here, and you're gonna rub across it. I don't know how we do it on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here, I'm going down really, really deep, and rubbing. - Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back, and push with your thumb, and go back and forth? - I think you could do that, but you really don't need to. You can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job. - And how long would you do that for, Bob? - I would do it two or three minutes, longer if you could do up to five even, you can do it. - You're probably gonna get fatigued fingers. - Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day. I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again you're trying to do it on the nodule, and you're trying to do it on the annular ligament. - To loosen that up? - To loosen it all up. 'Cause a lot of times this has got problems too. This is tightened up, and it's got some scar tissue on it. - Sure, okay. - So you wanna do that, and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers. - Okay, I'm gonna pull them back like that. On that specific finger? - On that specific finger. - Sure. - Or if it's the thumb, you could do it on the thumb. - Any red flag things you should- if you feel sharp pain or anything like that, should you stop? - Yeah, you should always be concerned about that, but really the pain is when it snaps open. This usually doesn't bother it. - So if you do this for say three days in a row, you think they may start to feel some progress with it? - Well, we gotta see. The other thing you're gonna do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger. - Okay. - So you're gonna take a rubber band, or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band, and you're gonna put it on your fingers like this, around all the fingers, and then you're just gonna work on straightening them like that. - It's a nice exercise to strengthen the extensors we call them of the fingers. Yeah, and this shouldn't cause any snapping, 'cause in order to make it snap, usually you have to make a full fist, in order to make it snap, to make that tendon or that bump go underneath the ligament. - Sure, that makes sense. - So just like this. And then finally, if you wanna when you finish, you actually can keep the tendon stretched, and you can actually do an ice massage. You wanna show, Brad, how that would be done? - Sure, you take a little dixie cup like this, if you fill it up almost full, put it in your freezer, let it freeze solid. And then when the ice is froze solid in there, you'd tear off the top like this, just enough all the way around so that the ice is exposed, and then you would just rub it over that area. - While you're stretching it. - Okay. For about five minutes is what I usually recommend. - Yeah, it usually doesn't take much longer, sometimes it freezes up a lot quicker than that. You don't need to go much longer than that. Now, if none of these things work, then you're gonna need to go to the doctor, and you can do a cortisone shot. And a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things, in 66% of the patients, but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So only a third of those get lasting relief from the shot. And the others have to have surgery. It's a simple surgery, if there is such a thing, but I mean it's an outpatient. And they go in and they release the tendon. - Right. So you're gonna go in, and leave the same day. - Right, exactly. So this is certainly worth a try. - Right. - So you're gonna do the cross fiber massage, you're gonna do the stretch, you're gonna do the strengthening, and then the ice. Give it a shot, and see if we can help your trigger finger. - All right, nice job, Bob. Thanks for watching.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0," 4

The video has a relatively clear aim of explaining ways to treat trigger finger, which is stated upfront. However, the aims could have been articulated more concisely and explicitly at the beginning. The explanations and demonstrations make up the bulk of the video content.

Explanation:
The transcript starts by stating they will discuss ""the top three ways to treat trigger finger"" after briefly describing what trigger finger is. This gives a clear indication of the overall topic and intent. However, the specific aims (the three treatment methods) are not explicitly listed upfront, but rather demonstrated and explained as the video progresses. A more concise statement of the three aims at the outset would have made the video's purpose even clearer from the beginning. Overall, the aims are present but could have been presented in a more straightforward and organized manner initially."," 4

The video provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger and outlines several treatment options, including massage techniques, stretches, strengthening exercises, and the use of ice massage. The presenters explain the underlying cause of trigger finger and demonstrate the techniques using a model. However, the video does not provide detailed information on the expected duration of treatment or the potential need for medical intervention if conservative measures fail. Overall, the video achieves its aims of educating viewers on trigger finger and offering practical self-management strategies, but lacks some specifics regarding treatment timelines and when to seek further medical care."," 5

The video is highly relevant as it provides comprehensive information about trigger finger, its causes, and different treatment options. The physical therapists explain the condition in detail, including its symptoms, affected groups, and the underlying mechanism causing the finger to get stuck and snap. They also demonstrate various self-treatment techniques, such as cross-fiber massage, stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, and ice massage. Additionally, they discuss further treatment options like cortisone injections and surgery if the self-treatment methods are ineffective. The video addresses most of the questions readers might have regarding trigger finger and its management, making it an excellent resource for anyone seeking information on this condition."," 2

The video provides some useful information on treating trigger finger through techniques like massage, stretching, and strengthening exercises. However, it does not clearly cite or reference any external sources of evidence such as research studies or expert opinions to support the claims made about the causes, prevalence, or recommended treatments. The information appears to be based primarily on the personal experience and opinions of the presenters, who identify themselves as physical therapists. While their professional background lends some credibility, explicit references to external evidence would have strengthened the video's informational value."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some potentially helpful information for treating trigger finger, but there are no clear dates given for the sources or evidence behind the recommended treatments. The only date mentioned is the implicit present day when the video was recorded and uploaded to YouTube. While the speakers claim expertise as physical therapists, there are no citations or references provided to back up their advice with recent medical research or guidelines. The lack of source dates makes it difficult to assess how current or evidence-based the information truly is. Some of the treatments seem reasonable based on general principles, but their specific efficacy for trigger finger is not substantiated with dated evidence in the video transcript."," 3

Explanation: The video provides a balanced overview of different treatment options for trigger finger, including self-massage, stretching, strengthening exercises, and the use of ice. It also mentions the possibility of seeking medical treatment, such as cortisone shots or surgery, if the conservative treatments are ineffective. However, the information is presented from a personal perspective, and it is unclear if a range of research studies or expert opinions were consulted in compiling the information. The video relies primarily on the personal experiences and recommendations of the two physical therapists, without explicitly citing external sources or research. Additionally, some aspects of the information are presented in a slightly sensational or emotive manner, such as referring to themselves as ""the most famous physical therapists on the internet"" and using a crude model to illustrate the condition."," 1

The video does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information regarding trigger finger treatment. The content is limited to explaining what trigger finger is and demonstrating some self-treatment techniques like massage, stretching, and icing. There are no suggestions for further reading materials, websites, or other organizations that could offer more advice or resources on this topic. The video solely focuses on the presenters' recommendations without referencing any external sources of information."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for trigger finger. The therapists mention that if the conservative treatments they recommend (massage, stretching, strengthening exercises, and ice) do not work, then the patient will need to consult a doctor for further treatment options such as cortisone injections or surgery. They acknowledge that cortisone injections provide lasting relief in only about one-third of cases, with the remaining patients requiring surgery. This discussion highlights the uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the most effective long-term treatment for trigger finger, particularly when conservative measures fail."," 3

The video provides some details on how the treatments work, but the explanations are often incomplete or unclear.

The cross-fiber massage is described as rubbing hard across the nodule and annular ligament to loosen them up, but the exact mechanism of how this helps is not fully explained.

The stretching exercise is shown, but there is no explanation of how stretching helps treat trigger finger.

The rubber band exercise for strengthening the finger extensors is explained as a way to strengthen those muscles, but the connection to treating trigger finger is not made clear.

The ice massage is described as a way to keep the tendon stretched, but again, the rationale for how this helps treat trigger finger is not provided.

The cortisone shot and surgery are mentioned as further treatment options if the initial treatments don't work, but there are no details provided on how these treatments address the underlying issue of trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for trigger finger. It explains that the cross-fiber massage, stretching, and strengthening exercises are aimed at loosening the affected area and reducing the catching or snapping sensation. However, it does not explicitly state the specific benefits of the ice massage treatment. The potential benefits of the cortisone shot (providing temporary relief in 66% of cases) and surgery (releasing the tendon) are mentioned, but not in detail. Overall, while some benefits are described, there is a lack of comprehensive coverage of the benefits for each treatment."," 3

The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments for trigger finger. While it does not explicitly mention risks for the non-invasive treatments like massage, stretching, and exercises, it does acknowledge the potential need for cortisone injections or surgery if these initial treatments are ineffective. For cortisone injections, it mentions that the relief is temporary in about two-thirds of patients, with the condition recurring. For surgery, it states that it is a simple outpatient procedure but does not provide any specific risks or complications. Overall, it covers some risks for the more invasive treatments but does not discuss potential risks or side effects of the initial conservative treatments."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes what would happen if no treatment is used for trigger finger. It mentions that if the recommended self-treatment techniques (massage, stretching, strengthening exercises, and icing) do not work, then the condition may require medical intervention such as a cortisone shot or surgery. However, the video does not provide a clear description of the risks or benefits of permanently forgoing treatment or of watchful waiting without any treatment. It mainly focuses on the self-treatment options and the potential need for medical treatment if those fail, but does not elaborate on the consequences of leaving the condition untreated."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any information about how the treatment choices affect the overall quality of life or day-to-day activities of the patient. The video focuses solely on explaining the condition of trigger finger and describing various treatment options such as massage, stretching exercises, and potential medical interventions like cortisone shots or surgery. However, it does not discuss the impact of these treatments on the patient's ability to perform daily activities or their overall quality of life."," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It discusses several non-surgical treatment options, such as cross-fiber massage, stretching exercises, and icing. However, it does not provide detailed information on who might benefit most from each option or under what circumstances. The video does mention that if the non-surgical treatments do not work, cortisone shots or surgery may be necessary, but it does not go into depth about when these options would be recommended or for whom they might be most appropriate. Overall, the video acknowledges that there are multiple treatment choices, but the information provided is somewhat limited in terms of guiding the viewer on how to select the most suitable option for their specific case."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting discussing treatment options with a doctor if the self-management techniques (massage, stretching, strengthening exercises, and ice massage) do not provide relief for trigger finger. It mentions that a cortisone shot or surgery may be recommended by a doctor if the conservative treatments are ineffective. However, the video does not explicitly encourage discussing these options with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals. It primarily focuses on demonstrating the self-management techniques and only briefly mentions the potential need for medical intervention.",set()

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about trigger finger, including its symptoms, causes, and home remedies for managing the condition. It covers essential aspects that viewers might be interested in learning about trigger finger. However, some additional details, such as the underlying causes, risk factors, and when to seek medical attention, could have made the information more comprehensive. Overall, the transcript addresses the key questions related to trigger finger to a considerable extent, making it partially relevant."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript mentions some sources of information, but they are not explicitly referenced or cited. The speaker refers to common symptoms and features of trigger finger, which seem to be based on general medical knowledge about the condition. However, there are no direct references to specific research studies or expert opinions to back up the claims made. The home treatment tips provided are also not attributed to any particular source. Overall, while the video covers relevant information about trigger finger, the sources of evidence used to compile the content are not clearly stated or referenced, resulting in a partial score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide explicit dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. However, it seems to be discussing trigger finger, a medical condition, from a general perspective without citing specific studies or sources with dates. The only date mentioned is the upload date of the video itself, which is not provided in the transcript. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the score is 2 (Partially), as only the date of the video itself is potentially clear, but no dates for acknowledged sources have been given."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript appears to be focused solely on presenting home remedies and exercises for treating trigger finger, without providing a balanced overview of other potential treatment options or considering the underlying causes or medical advice. While the information presented seems factual, it lacks objectivity by not referencing any medical research, expert opinions, or alternative treatments. The language used also has a slight promotional tone, suggesting a bias towards promoting the home remedies mentioned. Overall, the narrow focus on a specific treatment approach without exploring other perspectives or evidence-based information makes the content somewhat unbalanced and lacking in objectivity."," 2

Explanation: The video transcript provides some partial information about additional sources related to treating trigger finger pain. It mentions three home tips or remedies, namely trigger finger self-massage, trigger finger exercise, and trigger finger hot bath. However, it does not provide any details of further reading materials, websites, or other organizations that could offer more comprehensive information or support regarding trigger finger condition.

The video seems to be presenting three home remedies (self-massage, exercise, and hot bath) as definitive treatment options without discussing any potential limitations, alternative treatments, or differences in expert opinions. There is no discussion of uncertainty or lack of consensus around the recommended treatment approaches."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some details on how the suggested treatments (self-massage, exercise, and hot bath) are supposed to work for trigger finger, but the descriptions are relatively brief and lack in-depth explanations. For instance, it mentions that the massage and exercise involve pressing on the tender point and moving the finger, but doesn't explain the underlying mechanism by which this is meant to relieve the condition. Similarly, it states that the hot bath can increase the effect without clarifying how it contributes to the treatment. While the transcript touches on how each treatment is performed, it falls short of providing comprehensive descriptions of how they act on the body to achieve their therapeutic effects."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned. It states that following the three home tips (self-massage, exercise, and hot bath) can help ""avoid painful surgery"" for treating trigger finger. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific benefits of each treatment in terms of controlling or eliminating symptoms, preventing recurrence, or addressing the condition in the short or long term. The benefits are mentioned collectively for the three treatments, but not individually for each one."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or potential side effects of the treatments mentioned. While it does not explicitly discuss risks or side effects, it mentions that these home treatments can help ""avoid painful surgery,"" implying that surgery carries risks or complications. However, it does not describe any specific risks or side effects associated with the self-massage, exercises, or hot bath treatments themselves. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as it covers the risks or potential complications of one treatment (surgery) but not the others."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of not treating trigger finger or of postponing treatment. It focuses solely on describing the condition, its symptoms, and providing home remedies/exercises to alleviate the pain and symptoms.

However, it does not provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of how these treatments might improve day-to-day activities or overall quality of life. The transcript focuses primarily on the techniques for performing the treatments, but does not explicitly discuss their potential impact on daily functioning or well-being. Some additional details on the potential benefits of these treatments for improving movement, reducing pain, and enhancing the ability to perform daily tasks would be needed to fully address the question."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The video transcript mentions three home remedies or treatment options for trigger finger: self-massage, exercise, and hot bath. However, it does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice and under what circumstances. The transcript also does not suggest any alternatives to consider or investigate further before deciding on a particular treatment choice. While it acknowledges the possibility of surgery, it does not compare the home remedies to surgical treatment or provide guidance on when surgery might be necessary. The information is incomplete in terms of presenting multiple treatment choices and their respective considerations."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting discussing treatment options with healthcare professionals. It mentions the possibility of surgery for trigger finger, implying that this decision should be made in consultation with a doctor. However, it does not explicitly encourage discussing the home remedies or overall treatment plan with healthcare providers, family, or friends. The focus is primarily on explaining the condition and offering self-care tips. While this information can aid in shared decision-making, more explicit prompts to involve others in the decision process would have strengthened the support for shared decision-making.",set()
pndnd5dgumY,"Welcome back. Today we'll be addressing trigger thumb. Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon. Therefore when the thumb is being bent down, it either catches and snaps downward and locks into the palm of the hand or upon extension often times it's locked into the palm and when you push on it, it pops back open into an extended position. So the difference really is though is that the thumb is a much stronger joint. If you look at the base of the fingers, see how much tissue is here? There isn't a whole lot of muscular tissue versus the thumb joint which has the thinner end, it's a very large group of muscles that allow for flexion, adduction, abduction and extension. The thinner eminence is very thick, has a lot of muscular tissue on it. Taking the opposing finger, your index, your thumb and pressing into the area, you'll find a very, very tender and you can help release some of the restrictions and the tightness in the thumb joint itself. Often times the base of the MP joint here where it's catching, you can actually feel an adhesion or the nodule on the tendon itself. There's nothing wrong with doing some cross fiber friction across that. The tendon is going this way, you want to go across the tendon itself. You can do that for a couple of minutes. It'll be pretty tender. Again, you don't want to overdo it. Some of these things feel good like the stretches, the massage to the area, but overdoing it, too much of anything can irritate the area. Doing some cross fiber friction on that nodule adhesion, going back and forth, popping back and forth across the knot. What that's doing is breaking down the scar tissue, unraveling the fibers. What happens is often times you have an injury, you get a matrix of fibers crisscross in all kinds of areas to form protection to the injured area when the fibers actually need to be aligned. Cross fiber friction actually breaks that down, unravels them, and then when you follow it with exercise extension, it actually realigns those fibers as the muscle is utilized. The first series of stretches that we want to do is grabbing the thumb with the opposing hand, pulling it into extension, and holding it for a count of 10 to 15 seconds. Now the second stretch, same type of stretch, is pulling it back into extension. You want to stretch out the flexor tendon. The whole point is to break down the nodule adhesion on the tendon. You don't want to overstretch and irritate that nodule adhesion that's been formed there. Often times it's scar tissue from a micro tear on the tendon. You don't want to irritate it by overstretching, but you want to lengthen it and try to thin it out. Stretching can certainly help do that. Again, holding this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds. I like doing basic forearm stretches as well where you're just taking the whole entire wrist and fingers and pushing them back into extension. It helps loosen the hand. The first exercise is just getting basic strength. The injured fingers, or the non-injured fingers, help assist the injured finger, which is the thumb joint, into performing extension. So I'm going to do a series of just, I can do palm up isolated here, or palm up elbow moving. I don't know if you can be clearer in what I'm doing here. I'm moving from wrist extension, reflection, to wrist extension. Opening the hand, spreading the fingers apart as far as I can. That's the first exercise in the series. The second exercise is just full hand opening without any movement at the wrist, opening and closing the hand. It seems to be though that when you have a catching in the joint and trigger thumb, as soon as extension resistance is applied to it, pulling it down and you resist against it, it can open without catching. It's a very unique principle that when one muscle group contracts, the opposing muscle group relaxes, which must help lengthen and thin that tendon enough for that nodule adhesion to slide through the sheath. So, second exercise, opening and closing the hand. Third exercise, single finger. You don't get into this about until four weeks into the program. I'm going to place the hook on here. I don't have to undo the glove. Place the hook on the ring here. Place it down on the wrist junction. There. And perform single finger. I'm not moving these fingers here. What's great about this kit is that I don't have to undo anything. I just attach this and take it back off when I'm done. A single finger thumb extension. You actually want to isolate it so that it can work on its own in order to, again, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it, and allowing it to glide freely through the tendon sheath. So that's a series of three exercises. What I'm going to give you here is a couple more exercises, and the reason being the thumb joint needs specific attention to it. It's a huge joint, a very strong joint, but it has a lot of stress applied to it in daily activities. If I go to pick up something, what do I do? If I pick up this, my thumb goes on one side, my four fingers go on the remaining side. All this weight is distributed between four fingers versus my thumb, one single finger here, doing all the work on one side. So it's picking up four times the resistance. So what I want to do here is thumb up isolated or elbow moving. It doesn't make any difference. It's in the program, but thumb up isolated. It puts more stress on the, more strengthening stress, so more resistance on the thumb joint itself. And this enhanced program will be available. Again, you can follow the normal trigger, finger program. It's successful for 90% plus people. I just like to see more strength and more resistance in exercise applied to the thumb joint because it's more subject to trauma and injury. So again, the thumb up isolated, and then there's a supinated exercise. What we're doing here is starting on a palm down, pronated position. My wrist is flexed. As I extend my wrist upwards, I rotate my hand over. And what I'm doing here is the band still stays here, still staying on the bottom side of my forearm. So the resistance increases as I rotate because it's wrapping around my forearm. This puts a lot more resistance applied to the thumb joint itself, which is going to enhance its strength, which is going to, again, going to help correct the muscle imbalance, but also help thin the tendon, break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, and allow it to glide freely through the pulley system. Trigger finger is not like a basic muscle imbalance like carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. You actually have a nodule adhesion on a tendon. It takes longer to address because you're having to break down the tissue and remove that. So it takes longer. I know that the company offers a longer money back guarantee on it because of that. So I think you can just contact the company and request that. So again, the two additional exercises, thumb up and supinated. And it will fatigue you. So that's a trigger thumb program. Do your stretches, thumb stretches, massage it a bit. If you want to massage it first, then do the stretches. That's fine. I'm creating some more videos to help your injury disorders. If there's certain exercises or injuries that you want addressed, I haven't thought of them. Post up a question or request and I'll see what I can do. Thanks. . .",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0," 4

The video transcript provides a relatively clear overview of its aims, which seem to be explaining the causes of trigger thumb, demonstrating stretches and exercises to help treat it, and promoting a particular product or program for addressing the condition. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, and the flow of information feels somewhat disjointed, bouncing between explanations, exercise demonstrations, and product promotion. While the general topic and purpose are evident, a more focused introduction outlining the specific goals would have made the aims clearer. Overall, the aims are present but could have been conveyed in a more concise and organized manner."," 4

The video provides a fairly comprehensive explanation of trigger thumb, its causes, and various exercises and techniques to help alleviate the condition. It covers stretches, massage techniques, and specific exercises targeting the thumb joint. However, there are a few aspects that could have been covered in more detail or clarity, such as the exact mechanism behind the nodule adhesion formation, the expected timeline for recovery, and any potential risks or contraindications for the recommended exercises.

Overall, the video achieves its aims of providing information on trigger thumb and outlining a program of stretches and exercises to address the condition, but there are some minor gaps in the information provided."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information regarding trigger thumb, its causes, symptoms, and treatment through various stretching and strengthening exercises. It addresses potential questions readers might have about understanding the condition and how to manage it through exercises. However, some aspects like medication or surgical options are not covered, making the information partially relevant. The transcript focuses primarily on exercise-based treatment recommendations."," 3

The video transcript provides some references to sources of information, but they are not explicitly cited or clearly attributed. The speaker mentions principles and techniques for treating trigger thumb, but does not directly quote or reference specific research studies or expert opinions as evidence. While some general statements are made about the causes and mechanisms behind trigger thumb (e.g., ""Trigger finger and trigger thumb are caused by the same issue, nodule adhesion that's affected the flexor tendon""), there are no accompanying citations or references to back up these claims.

The video does seem to draw from the speaker's own expertise and experience as a medical professional, but the sources of this knowledge are not explicitly stated. The transcript suggests that the information presented is based on the speaker's understanding and approach to treating trigger thumb, rather than directly referencing external sources.

Overall, while the video provides some information on the treatment and management of trigger thumb, it lacks clear and direct references to specific sources of evidence,"," 3

Explanation: The transcript mentions no specific dates for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date-related information provided is ""four weeks into the program"" when referring to one of the exercises. Therefore, it is clear that the video itself was recently produced, but there are no dates given for the main sources or references that informed the content of the video. As such, a score of 3 is appropriate, indicating that dates for some but not all acknowledged sources have been provided."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript presents information primarily from a personal point of view, likely based on the presenter's own experience and expertise. While it provides detailed descriptions of various exercises and stretches for treating trigger thumb, there is no clear reference to multiple research studies or expert sources that were consulted. The focus is solely on the advantages of the presenter's recommended treatment approach, without mentioning or comparing other potential treatment options. The language used is generally objective, without overt bias or sensationalism. However, the lack of a balanced discussion of alternative treatments and the reliance on a single perspective make the information partially unbalanced or biased."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details about the company offering the product and the possibility of contacting them for an extended money-back guarantee, but it does not provide any specific information about additional sources of support or information outside of the company itself. The video focuses solely on explaining the exercises and techniques for treating trigger thumb, without suggesting further reading materials or other organizations that could provide more advice or information on the topic."," 5

The video clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for trigger thumb. The speaker acknowledges that while the standard trigger finger program is successful for most people, they prefer to include additional exercises specifically targeting the thumb joint due to its unique anatomy and greater susceptibility to trauma and injury. The speaker also mentions that the company offers a longer money-back guarantee for the trigger thumb program, implying that the treatment outcomes may be more uncertain or variable compared to other conditions. Overall, the video highlights the gaps in knowledge and the need for a tailored approach when treating trigger thumb, given the differences in expert opinion on the most effective treatment strategies."," 4

The video provides a fairly detailed description of how the various treatments work to address trigger thumb, including stretches, massage, exercises with resistance bands, and principles like breaking down nodules/adhesions on the tendon through friction and realigning tendon fibers. However, some of the explanations feel a bit incomplete or unclear at times, such as the exact mechanism by which resistance exercises help realign tendon fibers or reduce nodules. Overall, the descriptions cover the main principles behind how the treatments are intended to work, but could use some additional clarity and detail in certain areas."," 4

The video partially describes the benefits of the various treatments and exercises for trigger thumb. It explains that the goal of the treatments is to break down the nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, thin it out, and allow the tendon to glide freely through the sheath, thereby resolving the catching or locking of the thumb. However, it does not explicitly state the specific benefits of each individual exercise or treatment in terms of controlling symptoms, preventing recurrence, or eliminating the condition in the short or long term. The benefits are more generally described for the overall treatment approach rather than for each component."," 2

The video partially describes the risks or potential side effects associated with the treatments for trigger thumb. While it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects, it provides some cautionary advice that alludes to potential risks:

1. It mentions that overdoing the exercises or stretches can irritate the area, suggesting that excessive treatment could worsen the condition.

2. It also warns against overstretching and irritating the nodule adhesion, implying that improper stretching techniques could exacerbate the issue.

However, the video does not directly outline specific risks, side effects, or potential complications associated with the various treatments mentioned, such as massage, stretching exercises, or the use of resistance bands. It focuses primarily on explaining the exercises and techniques without explicitly detailing their potential adverse effects or long-term risks."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks and benefits of not treating trigger thumb. It mentions that without treatment, the condition may persist or worsen due to the presence of a nodule adhesion on the flexor tendon, which can prevent proper movement of the thumb. However, it does not explicitly outline the specific risks or potential consequences of leaving the condition untreated over an extended period. The focus is primarily on describing various exercises and stretches as a form of treatment, rather than providing a detailed discussion of the implications of not seeking treatment."," 3

Explanation: The video partially addresses how the described treatments affect overall quality of life. While it does not explicitly mention ""quality of life,"" it discusses how the treatments aim to alleviate the symptoms of trigger thumb, such as the catching and locking of the thumb, which can impact daily activities involving gripping and lifting objects. However, the information provided on the impact on day-to-day activities is limited and not discussed in detail. The video focuses more on the specific exercises and techniques used for treating trigger thumb."," 4

The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger thumb. While it primarily focuses on describing various stretches and exercises as the recommended treatment approach, it does acknowledge that some cases may require additional or alternative treatments.

Specifically, the video mentions that the company offers a ""longer money back guarantee"" for trigger thumb treatment, implying that more extensive treatment may be needed in certain cases. It also suggests contacting the company to request this extended guarantee, hinting at the potential need for additional treatment options.

However, the video does not explicitly describe who might benefit from alternative treatments or provide detailed information about what those alternatives could be. It primarily concentrates on the stretches and exercises without clearly outlining other potential treatment choices or the circumstances in which they might be recommended.

At44YQYDFVI,"For today, I would like to talk about painful and clicking fingers. It's called trigger finger. Maybe some of you have experienced this problem. What causes trigger finger? Normally, when we flex our finger, there is a long tendon that pulls the finger and helps it smoothly slide through a protective sheath that surrounds it. In cases of trigger finger, the protective sheath can become inflamed with repeated use such as typing, texting, and other hand manipulations. When the sheath is inflamed, the tendon cannot slide smoothly, thereby causing the finger to click. It can affect any finger. It can affect the thumb. With repeated clicks, the tendon can also become inflamed, causing a nodule like a scar to form. I'll show you the picture. Okay, I'll show you the picture. So this is a picture of how our hand works. We have tendons that attach to our finger bones, and this is how we bend our fingers. In cases of trigger finger, as you can see, there is a nodule at the base of the finger, and this causes the painful clicking. What are the risk factors for having trigger finger? Persons around between 40 to 60 years old, they are more at risk. People are more commonly affected than males. Another risk factor is when you keep on using your hands. People who frequently grip and handle things like for work, hobbies are more prone to get trigger finger. Too much typing, texting, or working out with heavy dumbbells may also cause this. Those who play musical instruments for long hours are at risk. People with diabetes and arthritis are more at risk of getting trigger finger. So I'll be teaching you the treatment for trigger finger. For mild diseases, you can just rest your hand for a month. This can help improve symptoms, avoid repeated gripping, be aware that too much gripping can worsen a trigger finger, avoid using vibrating machines, try soaking your hand in warm water – this can help reduce the pain and the clicking, and you have to protect your affected finger and your affected hand. I will be showing you some simple exercises and stretches for trigger finger and also for other hand conditions. In trigger finger, there is usually a nodule at the base of the finger. If it's the thumb, it's located here, or if it's the finger, it's located here. Usually I had trigger finger several years ago, and there was this nodule at this part. It was really very painful when you bend it. One thing you can do is you can massage the nodule, as I've shown you. Try to massage it gently, clockwise, counterclockwise, for one to two minutes, maybe two times or three times a day, and try to stretch it slowly. Don't injure yourself afterwards. You can see if this works or not. If it doesn't work, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon or a hand surgeon. The doctor might do some steroid injection. Doctors may inject a steroid solution near the base of the affected finger. It's not that painful and not that expensive. This injection is more effective, this steroid injection, if you give it within one to two weeks from the onset of symptoms. So you have to consult your orthopedic surgeon early. And if this steroid injection doesn't work, there's also a surgical release of a trigger finger. Hopefully, we don't have to come into that. I will show you some simple exercises, not only for trigger finger, for carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is when you have numbness and pain and sometimes weakness of your hand. I'll show you some simple exercises. You can follow me. Try to open and close your hand 10 to 20 times. Try to stretch and loosen your fingers. After 20 times, try to open and close like this. Try to feel the stretch. I can feel the stretch. Our hands are very important, so we have to keep them in shape. Afterwards, you can try some maneuver. This maneuver is used for carpal tunnel. In carpal tunnel, you have to go into certain positions for 5 to 10 seconds. Just follow me. This is the claw position. Gently 5 to 10 seconds. Next is the half fist position. 5 to 10 seconds. This helps the tendon to glide and slide. Next you do the table top. You can do this for one hand or both hands. Then you do the close fist, completely close fist. 5 to 10 seconds. You can do this 2 to 3 times a day. 2 to 3 times a day. And there's one simple exercise. You just turn your hands around. Keep your hands higher than your heart. The swelling will be less. I'll just show you two last simple exercises. You can do this 5 to 10 times. Bend downwards 5 to 10 times to loosen your hands. Then bend upwards. You can do this 10 times, maybe at most 20 times if you want to rest your hands. Then try to turn it around. If your finger clicks, that's okay. We're trying to loosen and condition your hands. Okay, so those are my simple exercises for trigger finger for carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope this helps you. And if it doesn't work, I mean if you have trigger finger or carpal tunnel, if it worsens, you have to see your orthopedic surgeon. So thank you for watching my video. Thank you for subscribing.

The speaker suggests consulting an orthopedic surgeon or hand surgeon if the home remedies and exercises do not work, but does not provide any specific resources or organizations for further information or support related to trigger finger or carpal tunnel syndrome. The entire focus is on the speaker's own recommendations and advice."," 3 (Partially)

The video mentions some areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for trigger finger, but the information provided is somewhat incomplete or unclear.

The doctor discusses various treatment options, including rest, avoiding repetitive gripping/vibration, warm water soaks, massaging the nodule, steroid injections, and surgery. However, the discussion of uncertainty is limited to a brief statement: ""If this steroid injection doesn't work, there's also a surgical release of a trigger finger. Hopefully, we don't have to come into that.""

While this implies that surgery is a less desirable option and that the effectiveness of steroid injections may be uncertain, the video does not provide a clear or detailed discussion of the gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning the various treatment choices. The uncertainties or trade-offs associated with each treatment option are not explicitly addressed."," 3

Explanation: The video provides a partial description of how the treatments work for trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome. It explains the mechanism behind trigger finger, where inflammation in the tendon sheath causes the tendon to catch and the finger to click or get stuck. However, it does not go into detail about how the recommended treatments, such as rest, steroid injections, and surgery, act on the body to alleviate the condition. For carpal tunnel syndrome, the video demonstrates exercises and hand positions but does not explain how these treatments work to address the underlying issue. Overall, while some information is provided about the causes of these conditions, the descriptions of how the treatments themselves work are incomplete or lacking."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for trigger finger. It explains that resting the hand for a month can help improve symptoms, and that steroid injections are more effective if given within 1-2 weeks of symptom onset. However, it does not explicitly mention the benefits of surgical release, which is mentioned as a treatment option. The video also covers exercises and stretches for trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome, but does not clearly state the specific benefits of these exercises. Therefore, while some benefits are described for certain treatments, not all treatments have their benefits fully explained, warranting a score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned for trigger finger. It mentions that steroid injection is a treatment option but does not explicitly discuss any risks or side effects associated with it. The video also mentions surgical release as another treatment option, but again does not describe any potential risks or complications related to the surgery. The only risk factor discussed is related to the condition itself (trigger finger) rather than the treatments. Therefore, since risks are not comprehensively covered for all the treatment options discussed, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks and benefits of not receiving treatment for trigger finger or postponing treatment. It mentions that resting the hand for a month can help improve mild symptoms, which implies that not doing anything may be an option for milder cases. However, it does not provide a clear assessment of the risks or benefits of permanently forgoing treatment or watchful waiting for more severe cases. The information provided is incomplete and lacks specificity regarding the consequences of different no-treatment options. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as it partially addresses the question but does not provide a comprehensive description of the risks and benefits of no treatment."," 2

The video provides some information about how the treatment choices for trigger finger may affect quality of life, but the details are limited and unclear. The doctor suggests resting the hand for mild cases, which could impact daily activities involving gripping or using the hands. However, there is no explicit discussion of how the other treatments like steroid injections or surgery might affect a person's ability to perform everyday tasks or overall quality of life. The information provided is incomplete in this regard."," 4

The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. The doctor mentions several treatment options, including resting the hand, soaking it in warm water, massage and stretching exercises, steroid injections, and surgical release as a last resort. However, the information on who might benefit most from each treatment option or under what circumstances is not explicitly stated.

While the video suggests trying rest, massages, and exercises first for mild cases, and then considering steroid injections or surgery if those don't work, it does not provide detailed guidance on how to determine the severity or stage of the condition to choose the appropriate treatment. The video also does not discuss potential risks, side effects, or contraindications for the different treatment options."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. The doctor suggests consulting an orthopedic surgeon or a hand surgeon if the home remedies and exercises do not work for treating trigger finger. However, there is no explicit encouragement to discuss treatment options with family, friends, or other healthcare professionals. The focus is primarily on explaining the condition, risk factors, and providing self-care tips. While seeking professional medical advice is mentioned, the video does not delve into the importance of shared decision-making or actively involving others in the treatment process.",set()
sjH6PE9-MTI,"The trigger finger is a condition that involves the tendons of the hand and the fingers. The tendons of the fingers pass through a series of pulleys, much like a fishing line passes through a series of guide wires on a fishing pole. These pulleys give us a mechanical advantage and give us a very strong grip. However, oftentimes the tendons can become inflamed and the pulleys can become thickened. This is what is referred to as a trigger finger. The symptoms of trigger finger consist of pain at the base of the fingers that is often associated with a nodule or a small bump that can be felt and it can oftentimes be associated with catching or locking of the finger. In very severe cases, this does require manual assistance to obtain full extension of the fingers. Trigger finger is often caused by such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or diabetes, but oftentimes the cause is undetermined. If you suspect that you may be suffering from trigger finger, the first thing to do is begin taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Aleve or ibuprofen. This will assist with the pain and will also decrease the inflammation around the tendon. You may also try gentle stretching at home, which would consist of locking the affected finger together and slowly stretching it out to try to stretch the tendon and prevent it from locking or triggering. If this does not work, it is advised to see your local hand surgeon, at which point you may receive a corticosteroid injection into the area of the pain at the base of the palm. A corticosteroid injection is extremely effective at decreasing the pain and oftentimes eliminating a trigger finger. If a corticosteroid injection does not work, a small surgery is recommended. For more information, please visit your local hand surgeon or visit www.orlandohandsurgery.com.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 4

WZ3LlLCsNic,"Alan Litt is playing his guitar pain free for the first time in almost ten years. Thanks to hand surgeon Dr. Stephen Troum, a member of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. Just three months ago Dr. Troum treated Mr. Litt's trigger finger, a common but very diblitating ailment. Today the two are sharing their passion for music. The pain was excruciating. I was in pain all the time, my hand was locking, my finger was locking up all the time. I was depressed because I couldn't play and um, but the constant pain was the worst thing. It hurt all the time. So by the time I came in to see Dr. Troum I could hardly open my hand and I didn't want to. I basically kept it comfortable, in a comfortable fist like this, because that was not aggravating it at all. The pain was 24 hours a day. As soon as, it's the first thing you think of when i woke up, it was the last thing I thought of when I went to bed. So basically that's where I was before I had the surgery. Well when Mr. Litt came in, he came in with the classic complaints of trigger finger and that is his ring finger was catching on him and locking, and it was very painful. It was interfering with his work but it was also interfering with his activity as a guitar player and a musician. Initially we tried to treat it without surgery and we put him on anti-inflamatory medication, we also will try steroid injections into the sheath to try and make the swelling and inflamation go down, but that doesn't work, then the next step would be surgery. Trigger Finger is basically a tendon problem where you have inflamation in the tendons typically the flexors in your hand, is where it occurs. The inflamation causes swelling around the tendon and that swelling basically causes the tendon to snag inside the sheath giving you this locking or clicking or cathing sensation. Imagine basically like your belt, a series of belt loops and imagine tieing a knot in your belt and you might be able to pull it through the belt loop but it will pop or catch you and certainly if the knot is too big it won't even pull through. Now imagine cutting that belt loop that belt loop it's getting caught on. The belt will stay on your waist because you've got all the other belt loops holding it there but you've caught the one belt loop, cut the one belt loop that is causing the problem. The procedure starts out after we've prepped and draped the patient's hand, made a sterile field, he's asleep of course and we'll make a small incision about half an inch or so in the palm overlying that tendon sheath and in Mr. Litt's case it was of the ring finger. So it'll be an incision sort of in the palm and then we go down to the tendon sheath itself and the pulley, which is called the a1 pulley, it's the actual structure where the sheath begins, the beginning of the tunnel, as you might think. We insize that pulley and open it up and you can see the tendons underneath and you can actually move the finger and see the tendons gliding the way they should and once you've had an adequate release, opened up the sheath enough and the tendons stop clicking you're basically done at that point. You wash the wound out and close it up. The surgery was easier than getting your teeth cleaned. I mean I went in, they put me to sleep I woke up and bada-boom bada-bing and it was done. So after about three weeks, I had no clicking, my finger was not clicking any more, wasn't locking up, still hurt. It still hurt from the surgery a little bit but that was to be expected. I was warned about that, and I got to tell you it was something akin to a miracle. It was great. It was fantastic. I can move my hand again. I can move my finger again, loosely, easily. So if you're out there and you got trigger finger go see a hand surgeon. That's my experience. If you want to seek out a hand surgeon and you have a problem with your hand go to www.handcare.assh.org, it's the website of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. They have lots of patient education resources on the site as well as a directory where you can put in your city or your ZIP code and find a hand surgeon who is fellowship trained and board certified in your area. It's an irratation, It's a knot in your ligament and the only way to get help is really just to get that thing out of there and go see a hand doctor because it works.",Trigger Finger,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0," 5

The aims of the video are clear. It is about educating viewers on trigger finger, a common hand condition that causes pain and locking of the fingers, and the surgical treatment option available for it. The video features a patient who had successful trigger finger surgery performed by a hand surgeon, and they explain the condition, symptoms, non-surgical treatments, and the surgical procedure in detail. The overall goal is to raise awareness about trigger finger and encourage those suffering from it to seek treatment from a qualified hand surgeon."," 5

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger, its causes, symptoms, and the surgical treatment for it. It achieves its aims of educating viewers about the condition and the procedure to treat it. The surgeon explains the anatomy and pathology behind trigger finger in an easy-to-understand manner, using analogies like the belt loop example. The patient's experience is also shared, giving a first-hand account of the pain and limitations caused by the condition, as well as the relief provided by the surgery. The transcript covers all the expected information from a description of trigger finger and its treatment, including details on the surgical technique, recovery process, and advice on seeking treatment from a qualified hand surgeon."," 5

Explanation: The video transcript is highly relevant as it provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger, a common hand condition. It covers the symptoms, causes, treatment options (both non-surgical and surgical), and the surgical procedure in detail. The personal experiences shared by the patient and the surgeon make the information relatable and easy to understand. The video effectively addresses the questions readers might have about trigger finger, its impact on daily activities, and the available treatments, making it a valuable resource for anyone seeking information on this condition."," 3

Explanation: The video partially cites sources of evidence for the information presented. While it does not provide explicit references to research studies or expert opinions, it features commentary from Dr. Stephen Troum, a hand surgeon and member of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, who explains the condition of trigger finger and the surgical procedure used to treat it. The patient, Alan Litt, also shares his personal experience with the condition and the treatment he received. However, no specific sources are cited to support the general information provided about trigger finger and its causes. Overall, the video relies on the expertise of the featured medical professional and the patient's testimony, but does not reference external sources or studies."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides clear information on when the surgery was performed on Mr. Litt, mentioning that it was done ""just three months ago"" by Dr. Troum. However, no specific dates are given for the sources or research used to compile the information presented in the video. The only clear date mentioned is for the surgery itself, which seems to be the main event or focus of the video. Therefore, I would give a score of 4, indicating that dates are partially provided, as only the date of the video's central event (the surgery) is clear, but not the dates of any other sources or information used to create the video."," 4

Explanation: The video appears to be partially balanced and unbiased. It primarily focuses on the advantages of a surgical treatment for trigger finger, highlighting the positive experience of a patient who underwent the procedure. While it mentions alternative treatment options like anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections, it does not delve into their potential benefits or drawbacks in depth. The information is presented from a personal perspective, relying heavily on the patient's and surgeon's accounts. However, the surgeon provides some objective medical explanations about the condition and the surgical procedure. Overall, the video leans towards promoting the surgical treatment option but does acknowledge other choices briefly."," 3

Explanation: The video partially provides details of an additional source of information. At the end of the video, the speaker mentions the website www.handcare.assh.org, which is the website of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. He states that this website has patient education resources and a directory to find hand surgeons in specific areas. However, no other sources of information or further reading are suggested beyond this single website mentioned. Therefore, I would rate this video as a 3, as it provides some additional source of information, but it is limited to just one website related to the same organization that the speaker is a part of."," 5

The video clearly discusses areas of uncertainty and differences in expert opinion regarding treatment choices for trigger finger. The surgeon, Dr. Troum, explains that initial treatment typically involves anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections to reduce inflammation and swelling. However, he mentions that if these conservative treatments do not work, then surgery becomes the next step. This indicates that there is uncertainty about which treatment approach will be effective for a given patient, and that surgery may be necessary if non-surgical options fail to provide relief. The video presents surgery as the definitive treatment option when other methods are insufficient, reflecting the differing expert opinions on the appropriate course of treatment based on the patient's response."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how the treatments for trigger finger work. It explains that the inflammation and swelling around the tendon cause it to snag or catch in the sheath, leading to the locking or clicking sensation. It also describes the surgical procedure, where the pulley or sheath is incised to release the tendon. However, the details on how anti-inflammatory medications or steroid injections work to treat trigger finger are not provided. The explanation focuses primarily on the surgical treatment, while the non-surgical treatments are only briefly mentioned. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, as the descriptions of how the treatments work are incomplete or unclear for some of the treatment options mentioned."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the treatment for trigger finger. It mentions that after the surgery, the patient's finger was no longer clicking or locking up, and he could move his hand and finger easily again. This suggests that the surgery helped control or eliminate the symptoms of trigger finger in the short term. However, there is no explicit mention of long-term benefits or preventing recurrence of the condition. The benefits of other treatments, such as anti-inflammatory medication or steroid injections, are not described. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as the benefits are described for the surgical treatment but not for the other treatments mentioned."," 2

The transcript partially describes the risks of the trigger finger surgery treatment. It mentions that there would be some pain and discomfort after the surgery, which is expected. The patient states, ""It still hurt from the surgery a little bit but that was to be expected. I was warned about that."" However, the transcript does not provide details on any other potential risks, side-effects, complications, or long-term adverse reactions associated with the surgery. The focus is primarily on describing the procedure and the patient's positive outcome. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as some risk is mentioned but not in a comprehensive manner for this treatment."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any information about the risks or benefits associated with not treating trigger finger or delaying treatment. The focus is entirely on the surgical treatment procedure and the relief experienced by the patient after undergoing the surgery. There is no mention of what could happen if the condition is left untreated or if treatment is postponed or forgone permanently. The video aims to educate viewers about the surgical treatment option but does not discuss the implications of a ""no treatment"" approach."," 2

The transcript provides some information about how the trigger finger treatment (surgery) affected the patient's quality of life, specifically related to his ability to play the guitar and the constant pain he experienced before the surgery. However, the information is somewhat limited and does not go into great detail about the overall impact on day-to-day activities beyond playing the guitar.

The patient mentions that the pain was constant, affecting him 24/7, and that he was depressed due to the inability to play the guitar. After the surgery, he mentions being able to move his hand and finger easily again, implying an improvement in quality of life. However, there is no explicit discussion of the effects on other daily activities or a comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of life impact."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It mentions that initially, non-surgical treatments such as anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections were tried before considering surgery. However, the video primarily focuses on the surgical treatment option and does not provide clear information about who might benefit more from non-surgical treatments or under what circumstances these alternatives might be preferred over surgery. The information about treatment choices is incomplete, and the video mainly promotes the surgical approach as the solution."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but not to a very high degree. It primarily focuses on describing the trigger finger condition, the surgical treatment process, and the positive outcome for the patient. However, there are a few instances where the video suggests discussing treatment options with healthcare professionals:

1. The surgeon mentions trying non-surgical treatments like anti-inflammatory medication and steroid injections before considering surgery, implying a discussion of these options with the patient.

2. At the end, the patient recommends seeking out a hand surgeon if you have a hand problem, suggesting discussing the condition with a specialist.

3. The video provides the website of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, which could potentially lead to further information and discussion about treatment choices.

While these points encourage seeking medical advice, the video does not explicitly promote an in-depth shared decision-making process between the patient and healthcare providers regarding the various treatment alternatives and their pros an",set()

1HNAfxa-cRc,"♪ Bob and Brad, ♪ ♪ the two most famous physical therapists on the internet. ♪ - Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist. - Brad Heineck, physical therapist. Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion of course, Bob. Put that down! - A little hint of what we're gonna talk about there. We're gonna talk about trigger finger. - Carry on, carry on. - If you have it you probably know it generally affects the thumb or the ring finger or the ring finger or the middle finger. - Get your fingers figured out. - Ring finger, middle finger or thumb. - Okay. - Most common, very common in older women. - Okay. - As you get up into forties and sixties, it tends to happen. - So what are the symptoms of a trigger finger? - First off, if it's very stiff and tender in the mornings and you may actually, quite often, usually I see a lump right here on the palm of the hand. - Right where the palm meets the finger. Okay. - And it pops and clicks, but the the telltale sign is if it locks in place. - So when you close your hand that's when it's gonna go like a click. - It could, it could be when you close it could even, you could close it fine. And then when you open it- - It doesn't wanna open. - Yeah. It doesn't wanna open. - And then you get past that point. - Yeah. - And it usually hurts to get past that point. Is that correct? - Right. It's not a fun thing. - Okay. - So we actually have a video on that too, on different ways to treat it, but this Brace Ability and I'll put the name down here and I'll put their link down below. - Sure. - They're a place that sells braces and a lot of nice braces. - Yep. - And they sent us one of these and they say she sent us three of these and we used them on patients. - Sure. - And they really liked them. - The patients did. - The patients really liked them. - Okay. - What they like about it is that one, it's one size fits all. 'Cause normally a brace like this you have to have fitted, believe it or not. And in fact, we had a lady who had a brace that was fitted for her and she lost it. - So the custom brace. - Yep. - Okay. - It was a custom brace. And so we gave her one of these and she ends up finding the other brace while she's wearing this one. And she still prefers this one. - Over the custom one. - Yeah. Over the custom one. - Sure. - So she's still wearing this. So that's, I thought it was a good testimony to that. - Right. So what does that do, Bob? - Well, the thing is it, it stops you from bending the finger all the way. - So the first two joints can bend. - Right. - But the one closest to the palm is the one that has the problem. And that's the one that stays still. So you don't- - That's exactly right. So one of the problems with braces quite often is if they brace the whole thing you can't move it at all, which is not good. - Right. - You wanna have some movement. So it kind of gives a solution here 'cause it gives you some movement but it doesn't give you the movement that's gonna cause it to lock up. - And that's the painful part. - Right. - Unfortunately this is not gonna make your pain go away, it may make your problem go away. - Right. - It's likely still gonna be there. I know there's injections you can do. And there's surgery and a lot of people, even after all that, it can come back. - Sure. - So my only suggestion about this and we're gonna show you how to put this on in just a minute. But my only suggestion for this would be to make it like a tan color. - We're talking to the manufacturer. - Talking manufacturer, that way it wouldn't be so noticeable. - Right. - 'Cause it, it is quite- - Right. - Looks like a ring this way, but- - Sure. Kinda a weird ring though, Bob. - Yeah. I don't have it all the way. - We're gonna show him how to put it on. - Yeah, let's do that right now. We'll cut away. All right. We're gonna start off, you're gonna take the brace and you're gonna put it... You're gonna have your palm up here like this just to see where you're putting it here. And it's gonna below that knuckle right here. You're gonna put it right below the ring where- - Where the joint is. - Yeah. Where the joint is. So you're gonna put it like that, flat, and you're gonna pull up the one side, pull up the other side. It's a little clumsy. And then you're gonna go ahead and tighten it up. - Good old Velcro, huh Bob? - Velcro. It's this and there you go. And once it's on you can tighten it up a little bit more yet. And there you go. It's all ready to go. - Excellent. - So thanks a lot to BraceAbility. - You bet. Nice brace. - All right.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 4

The video partially explains its aims. While it does not provide a clear overarching objective at the beginning, the content implies that the main goal is to discuss trigger finger condition and demonstrate a brace product for treating it. The speakers mention they will talk about trigger finger symptoms and show how to use the brace. However, the aims could have been more explicitly stated upfront for better clarity. The discussion covers some relevant information about trigger finger and the brace, but in a somewhat scattered manner without a cohesive flow."," 4

The video provides most of the information one would expect from a description of trigger finger and a demonstration of how to use the specific brace being reviewed. It covers the common symptoms, causes, and typical sufferers of trigger finger. It also shows the benefits of this particular brace compared to custom braces, as well as how to properly put it on. However, the video does not go into significant detail on all available treatment options beyond mentioning injections and surgery. Overall, it achieves its main aim of informing about trigger finger and reviewing the featured brace quite well, while leaving out some supplementary treatment information."," 4

Explanation: The video provides relevant information about trigger finger, its symptoms, and a potential treatment option in the form of a finger brace. It covers the key aspects of trigger finger, including the typical affected fingers, stiffness and locking sensation, and the presence of a lump on the palm. The demonstration of how to wear the brace and its advantages over custom braces adds practical value. However, the video does not delve into the underlying causes, risk factors, or alternative treatment options for trigger finger, which could be additional information readers might seek. Therefore, while the video is largely relevant, it only partially addresses the broader topic of trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some references to external sources, but not for all the main claims or statements made. The physical therapists mention that they received the brace from a company called ""BraceAbility"" and provide their link, which can be considered a source of information for the brace itself. However, they do not cite any sources for the information they provide about trigger finger, such as its symptoms, causes, and treatment options. The video seems to rely mainly on the personal experiences and opinions of the two physical therapists, without explicitly referencing research studies or expert opinions to support their claims about trigger finger. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, as the sources of evidence are clear to some extent, but not for all the main statements made in the video."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some clarity on when the information was produced, but does not give specific dates for all the sources acknowledged. The date of the video itself is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from contextual cues that it is a relatively recent video discussing a current product. However, no dates are provided for the sources of information on trigger finger symptoms, treatment options like injections or surgery, or any medical studies/literature that may have been referenced. While the product being reviewed (the BraceAbility trigger finger brace) is likely a current offering, the video does not provide dates for the general trigger finger information presented."," 3

Explanation:
The video provides some useful information about trigger finger and demonstrates how to use a particular brace for treating it. However, it has a clear bias towards promoting the featured brace product from ""BraceAbility."" While the presenters acknowledge other treatment options like injections and surgery, they do not provide a balanced comparison or discuss the potential pros and cons of these alternatives in detail. The video primarily highlights the advantages of the featured brace without much objective analysis of its limitations or how it compares to other braces or treatments. Additionally, the information seems to be based mainly on anecdotal experiences rather than citing specific research studies or expert sources. Therefore, while informative to some degree, the video lacks a truly balanced and unbiased perspective, warranting a score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The video partially provides details of an additional source of information. The hosts mention and show a brace from a company called ""BraceAbility"" for treating trigger finger. They provide the company's name and state that they will include a link to the company's website in the video description. However, no other sources of information or organizations related to trigger finger treatment are mentioned. The only additional source discussed is a specific product from BraceAbility, which appears to be a commercial promotion rather than a comprehensive information resource."," 1

The video does not mention any areas of uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for trigger finger. It primarily focuses on describing the symptoms of trigger finger and introducing a specific brace product as a potential treatment option. While the video acknowledges that the brace may not alleviate pain and that the condition can recur even after injections or surgery, it does not delve into a discussion of the uncertainties or differing expert opinions surrounding the various treatment choices. The video's tone is informative but does not explicitly address areas of uncertainty in treating trigger finger."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details on how the trigger finger brace treatment works, mentioning that it limits the bending of the affected joint while allowing movement of the other finger joints. However, it does not go into detail about the mechanisms by which other potential treatments like injections or surgery work to address trigger finger. The descriptions of how treatments work are partial and incomplete."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the finger brace treatment for trigger finger. It explains that the brace allows some movement of the finger joints while preventing the problematic bending of the joint closest to the palm, which can cause locking or painful clicking. However, it does not describe any benefits of other potential treatments mentioned, such as injections or surgery. The video focuses primarily on the features and application of the finger brace itself rather than comprehensively covering the benefits of different treatment options for trigger finger."," 2

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential complications associated with the treatments for trigger finger. It mentions that the brace itself will not make the pain go away or necessarily resolve the underlying problem. However, it does not provide any details on the specific risks or side effects of other treatment options like injections or surgery that are briefly mentioned. The focus is primarily on introducing and demonstrating the use of the brace product. While it acknowledges that the brace may not fully address the issue, it does not explicitly discuss the potential risks involved with the other treatment approaches."," 1

Explanation: The video does not provide any information about the risks or benefits associated with not treating trigger finger or postponing treatment. The focus is solely on describing the symptoms of trigger finger and demonstrating the use of a specific brace as a treatment option. There is no mention of what could happen if no treatment is pursued, or the potential consequences of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment. The video lacks any discussion related to the risks or benefits of not receiving treatment."," 1

The video transcript does not contain any references to how the treatment choices (in this case, the trigger finger brace) affect overall quality of life or day-to-day activities. The video focuses solely on describing the symptoms of trigger finger, the features of the brace, and how to properly put it on. There is no mention of how using the brace might impact a person's ability to perform daily tasks or their overall quality of life."," 3

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for trigger finger. It mentions that injections and surgery are potential treatment options, in addition to wearing the brace featured in the video. However, it does not provide detailed information about who might benefit most from each treatment option or under what specific circumstances one might be preferred over the others. The discussion of alternatives is brief and lacks depth. While it acknowledges choices exist, the information provided about evaluating those choices is incomplete."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making by mentioning that injections and surgery are treatment options for trigger finger, but it does not explicitly encourage discussing these options with doctors or health professionals. The focus of the video is more on introducing and demonstrating the use of a particular brace product for trigger finger. While it touches on other treatments, it does not delve deeper into the process of making an informed decision by consulting with medical professionals or loved ones about the various treatment choices available.",set()
58xQr9tOx24,"Hello, my name is Sanj Kakkar. I'm a consultant hand surgeon here at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and today we'll be talking about trigger finger. Trigger finger is a common diagnosis that we see in our hand clinic on a daily basis, where patients come in and they're experiencing pain in their hand, and sometimes the finger gets stuck. So, for example, when the finger is down, they often have pain and try to get it straightened. They often complain also of pain lower on in the finger, but the actual process that's going on is right over here, which is on the undersurface of the knuckle. And in terms of what's happening, if you look at this model here, the skin has been taken off for simplicity, but you can see these blue structures, and these are the tendons, and these are basically the rope that allow us to move our fingers back and forth. To keep the rope close to the bone, we have some natural thickenings, and these are called pulleys, and there are eight of these in the finger. However, in trigger finger, the actual process of where the problem is happening is on the undersurface of the finger, just underneath the knuckle joint. In terms of the cause of trigger finger, the majority of cases we don't know what the cause is. Sometimes it's related, for example, to inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, but the belief is that when one is gripping, there is a lot of force on the tendons overlying that pulley and underlining the knuckle, and that's what causes the inflammation. Patients complain of sometimes pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. They have difficulty in extending their fingers, and in terms of the actual diagnosis, it can be made readily in the office. Patients tend to be tender, just in this area where one's pushing, and you could actually feel it, the clicking, when they're making the fist. In terms of the treatment, a simple measure one can do is, for example, use a splint that keeps the fingers straight, especially at nighttime, and so that relieves the pain that patients have in the morning. We can also give a steroid injection, and this tends to work well, for example, in non-diabetics, in younger patients, where they've had symptoms for a short period of time, and also when the trigger finger, it tends to affect one finger, and sometimes it can affect a number of fingers. If the injection does not work or is not offered, other procedures that can be done is an office procedure, where one can place a needle just underneath the skin and release that catching pulley, or the other alternative is in the operating room. And this is done, it takes about five to ten minutes, and we need to be careful here, there are numerous nerves and blood vessels that need to be protected, and one simply removes the catching pulley system. Sutures are usually placed that come out after about two weeks' time, however, the patients are able to move their fingers straight away, and it's a relatively reproducible operation with good outcomes.",Trigger Finger,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0," 4

The video transcript provides a good overview of trigger finger, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. The aims of the video seem to be to educate viewers about what trigger finger is, how it is diagnosed, and what treatments are available. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, which could make it slightly unclear for some viewers what the precise scope and purpose of the video is. Overall, the aims are reasonably clear from the content covered, but an explicit statement of the aims at the beginning would have made them more apparent."," 4

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger, including its definition, symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment options. The speaker, a hand surgeon, explains the condition in detail, using visual aids to illustrate the underlying anatomy and pathophysiology. The information covers the aims outlined, such as describing what trigger finger is, how it is diagnosed, and the various treatment modalities available.

However, there are a few aspects that could have been elaborated upon or clarified further. For instance, the specific risk factors for developing trigger finger, beyond inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, could have been mentioned. Additionally, the relative effectiveness or success rates of the different treatment options (splinting, steroid injections, percutaneous release, and surgical release) could have been discussed in more depth.

Overall, while not exhaustive, the transcript provides a substantial amount of relevant information on trigger finger, fulfilling the majority of the expecte"," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about trigger finger, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. It covers various aspects that readers might be interested in learning about this condition. However, some information, such as the specific details of the surgical procedure, may be more technical than what general readers would need. Overall, the information is largely relevant, but some parts may be slightly too specialized for a general audience."," 3 (Partially)

Explanation: The video transcript provides some references to sources of information, primarily in the form of expert opinions and general medical knowledge. For example, the speaker mentions that the majority of cases of trigger finger have an unknown cause, but sometimes it is related to inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes. However, no specific research studies or references are cited to support these claims. The treatment options mentioned, such as using splints, steroid injections, and surgical procedures, are likely based on standard medical practices, but the sources of these recommendations are not explicitly stated. Overall, while the video relies on the speaker's expertise as a hand surgeon, it lacks direct citations to specific scientific sources or studies."," 2

Explanation: The transcript does not provide specific dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. The only date mentioned is the present tense, implying that the video was produced recently. However, there are no explicit dates given for any external sources or research studies referenced in the content. The information appears to be primarily based on the speaker's expertise and experience as a consultant hand surgeon at Mayo Clinic, but without citing specific dated sources. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as only the date of the video itself can be inferred, but not the dates of any acknowledged external sources."," 4

The video transcript appears to be mostly balanced and unbiased, providing an overview of trigger finger condition, its causes, diagnosis, and treatment options. The information is presented from a medical expert's perspective, and it covers various aspects of the condition objectively.

However, there are a few instances where personal opinions or preferences seem to be expressed, such as when discussing the effectiveness of steroid injections for non-diabetics and younger patients with shorter symptom duration. Additionally, the transcript does not explicitly reference multiple research studies or expert sources, although it is likely based on the presenter's medical expertise and experience.

Overall, while the information is largely objective and covers the topic comprehensively, there are minor instances of potential bias or lack of explicit reference to multiple sources, resulting in a score of 4 (partially balanced and unbiased)."," 1

The transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to trigger finger. It is a comprehensive explanation of the condition, its causes, symptoms, and treatment options by a medical expert from Mayo Clinic. However, the video does not suggest further reading materials or mention any other organizations that provide advice and information about trigger finger. The information is limited to the expert's explanation without any external references or resources."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially discusses areas of uncertainty regarding the treatment choices for trigger finger. While it mentions various treatment options, such as splinting, steroid injections, percutaneous release, and surgical release of the pulley, it does not explicitly discuss the gaps in knowledge or differences in expert opinion concerning these treatment choices. However, it does acknowledge that the cause of trigger finger is often unknown, stating ""the majority of cases we don't know what the cause is."" This implies some level of uncertainty in the understanding of the condition itself, which could potentially impact the treatment decisions. Additionally, the transcript suggests that steroid injections may work better for certain patient populations (non-diabetics, younger patients, and those with shorter symptom duration), indicating that there may be different considerations and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of this treatment option."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides a partial description of how the treatments for trigger finger work. It explains that using a splint relieves pain by keeping the finger straight, and that a steroid injection can help in certain cases. However, it does not provide details on how the steroid injection or the surgical release procedure work to treat the underlying condition. The description of the surgical release is limited to stating that the ""catching pulley"" is removed, without elaborating on how this resolves the issue. While some information is given, a more comprehensive explanation of the mechanisms of action for each treatment is lacking."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of each treatment for trigger finger. It mentions that using a splint at night can ""relieve the pain that patients have in the morning."" It also states that a steroid injection ""tends to work well"" in certain cases, implying it can control or eliminate symptoms. However, the benefits of the office procedure (releasing the catching pulley with a needle) and the surgical procedure (removing the catching pulley system) are not explicitly described in terms of symptom relief or preventing recurrence. The transcript focuses more on explaining the procedures themselves rather than their specific benefits. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as benefits are described for some, but not all, of the treatments mentioned."," 2

The video transcript provides some information on the potential risks and complications associated with certain treatments for trigger finger, but it does not comprehensively describe the risks for each treatment option mentioned.

For the steroid injection treatment, no specific risks or side effects are mentioned. For the office procedure involving releasing the pulley with a needle, no risks are described. 

The only treatment for which potential risks are briefly noted is the surgical procedure in the operating room. The transcript states that ""we need to be careful here, there are numerous nerves and blood vessels that need to be protected,"" implying a risk of nerve or vascular injury during surgery.

However, no other potential surgical risks or complications, such as infection, scarring, or prolonged recovery, are mentioned. Overall, while some risks are touched upon for one treatment modality, the video does not provide a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with each treatment option."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of not receiving treatment (i.e., postponing or permanently forgoing treatment) for trigger finger. The video focuses on describing the condition itself, its causes, and the available treatment options such as splinting, steroid injections, and surgical release of the pulley system. However, it does not discuss what would happen if no treatment is used or the potential consequences of delaying or avoiding treatment altogether."," 2

The transcript provides some information about how the treatment choices may affect quality of life, but the information is incomplete and lacks clear details. The transcript mentions that splinting can relieve pain, especially in the morning, and that surgical release of the pulley allows patients to move their fingers immediately after the procedure. However, there is no explicit discussion of how the different treatment options impact overall quality of life or day-to-day activities beyond finger mobility and pain relief. More comprehensive information about the effects on daily functioning, activities of daily living, and overall well-being would be needed to fully address the question."," 4

The video provides a comprehensive overview of trigger finger and its treatment options, indicating that there may be more than one possible choice. It mentions several treatment methods, including splinting, steroid injections, an office procedure with a needle release, and surgery to remove the catching pulley system. However, the information on who might benefit most from each treatment option and under what circumstances is somewhat limited. The video states that steroid injections tend to work well in non-diabetics, younger patients, those with shorter symptom duration, and when only one finger is affected. It also suggests that surgery may be considered if the injection is ineffective or not offered. Overall, while it acknowledges multiple treatment choices, the video could provide more explicit guidance on the factors that might influence the selection of one approach over another."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it falls short of providing very good support. While the video explains the condition, causes, and treatment options in detail, there are no explicit suggestions for patients to discuss these options with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. The video is primarily focused on educating viewers about trigger finger from a medical perspective, rather than encouraging shared decision-making. However, by providing information about different treatment choices, such as splinting, steroid injections, needle procedures, and surgery, the video indirectly supports patients in having informed discussions with their healthcare providers.",set()
kB-V9Sj2nok,"What's the cause of the trigger finger and how can you heal it? Hi and welcome to my channel. Today we're going to talk about the trigger finger. I know a lot of people who have that exact same problem and I also have some students who have the trigger finger. In order to solve a problem you always have to know what has caused it. Well sometimes the trigger finger is something that you were born with. In that case you can't do anything about the cause because you don't know anything about it. But very often people who have diabetes have trigger finger. People who are totally stressed out often have a trigger finger. Also if you work with a computer too often and use your hand all day long. Also when you have hands, neck and shoulders. That could be another cause. There are loads of different things you could look into. One of the best things to do is to journal. So start journaling and writing down whatever your finger snaps. Yeah, the trigger finger or the snapping finger. So when does it happen? What did you do before? Were you stressed out before? Did you work on a computer all day long? Or was your neck very tense? What exactly happened before? That would help you to find a cause and in most cases if you eliminate the cause then you solve the problem. So that would be a very helpful thing for you to do. Then I will show you which exercises you could do with your fingers in order to get rid of your problem. So let's get started right away. I know people who managed to eliminate that problem within the shortest period of time. Meaning a couple of weeks or a couple of months. And that helped them to avoid doing the surgery. So surgery is not necessary if you can avoid doing it. If you can use something that can help you. Even if it takes longer. Surgery takes 3 to 5 minutes. But you never know what's going to happen afterwards. And if you really take the responsibility into your hands and start working on it and improving your life situation. Then everything will click into place. So in case it's your index finger that's been causing the problem. Then stretch your arm. Take your index finger and start pulling it back. It should feel comfortable. It shouldn't cause any pain. But you should also be able to feel the stretching. Which goes here through the finger and perhaps even through the arm. So if you can feel that then you're doing it right. If it was your middle finger do the same thing with the middle finger. So whatever finger has been causing the problem. Focus on that finger and keep stretching it. And if you like the exercise do it with all fingers because stretching is always good. It's always good for you. And in case you would like to dive deeper into stretching then definitely look into doing yoga. That is something that's really beneficial especially for musicians. I can highly recommend it. So after doing this stretching exercise make sure that your arm is straight and your hand is bent backwards. As far as it goes. Then you just go back and move your fingers a little bit. Relax them. And remember to do this many times during the day. Like two or three times during the day. Every single day. And don't stop doing it even if you notice some improvement. Keep doing this exercise for a minimum of six weeks or even one year. Because the problem could come back. I know in some cases it comes back and people get so frustrated then they go straight to surgery. And I don't think that's necessary. You can definitely avoid that. So keep doing your exercises. Keep stretching. And then you will see how you can solve a problem within the shortest period of time. And even if it takes one year it's totally worth it. Because you'll notice that you're capable of changing things and creating the life situation of your dreams. Am I right? After doing your exercises or before you can also massage your hand. You can massage your whole hand and fingers and everything. But if you don't have enough time then definitely massage here. Where the finger starts at the beginning of the finger. We want to give it a nice massage. And do that every day. Either before you do the exercises or after. It doesn't matter. Whatever feels comfortable to you. There are loads of other methods that could improve the flexibility of your fingers. One of them is acupuncture. The other one is lifestyle changes. Make sure you drink enough water. You exercise regularly. You get enough sunshine. And you eat loads and loads of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis. All of that plays into your health. And if part of your body doesn't work the way you want it to work then definitely ask yourself some important questions. Am I taking care of myself as well as I can? And you can always improve that. Now I am going to show you on my violin what you could do in order to help your fingers become very flexible and relaxed while you are playing. So first of all when you are playing on an E and A string your left arm is looking to the floor. The tip of your elbow is facing the floor. But when you are playing on the D string and on the G string your arm comes out so that you can see your elbow. And that is very important because it allows your fingers to stay on a string without having to stretch. Which would put extra stress on them. Which you don't want to have because you don't need any extra stress. Especially if you have a trigger finger. So make sure to move your arm just like a pendulum. Always moving around depending on which string you are playing. So when we are on the A string it is here facing the floor. When you are on the D string it comes out. And when you play on the G string it comes out even more. And in order to find out whether you took your arm out far enough you can check it here by plugging the string with your pinky. If your pinky can plug the string on which you are playing without having to stretch or to get stressed out about it then you are on the right path. Then you are doing the right thing. So remember this very important tip. Take your arm out when you are playing on the D and on the G string. I hope you found this video helpful. In case you didn't give us thumbs up, subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next video. Leave me your questions or comments down below. I will see you again in the next video.

Y4Se6z-qNmU,"Trigger finger is a condition in which a finger locks up or gets stuck in a flexed position. It can be difficult and painful to straighten out the finger. When it does straighten out, it snaps open or triggers. In order to understand why this occurs, it is important to understand a little bit about the anatomy of the finger. Two tendons travel up the bones of the fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus attaches to the bone at the tip of the finger, known as the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum superficialis, which sits just on top, attaches to the middle phalanx. As muscles in the forearm contract, they pull on these tendons, which in turn pull on the bones of the finger. This bends, or flexes, the finger. Without anything holding the tendons up against the bones, they would bowstring as the muscles contracted, and so there are small ligamentous structures, known as pulleys, that hold the flexor tendons in place as they travel down the bones of the fingers. Some of the pulleys have fibers that cross over one another. They are called cruciate pulleys. Some of the pulleys simply pass straight over the tendons. They are called annular pulleys. The pulleys are numbered according to their position. Triggering usually occurs at the A1 pulley, or the first annular pulley. If something irritates the flexor tendons, they may swell. This causes rubbing and friction against the pulley each time the finger bends and extends. The irritation worsens and the tendons thicken. Over time, the tendons become too thick and swollen to glide normally through the pulley. Once the finger has been flexed, the thickened, swollen portion of the pulley gets stuck. With effort, it can be forced through the pulley and the finger triggers open.",Trigger Finger,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0," 5

The video transcript clearly outlines the aims of explaining the condition known as ""trigger finger"" and the underlying anatomical mechanisms that cause it. It starts by defining trigger finger as a condition where a finger gets stuck in a flexed position and snaps open when straightened.

w8hXvyWGupo,"If you're someone dealing with pudendal neuralgia, there are certain things that may be happening in your day-to-day routine that could actually be exacerbating your symptoms and you may not know it because it may not hurt at the time, it may show up a few hours later or even a day or two later. In today's video, we're going to discuss these activities and things that you can do at home to provide a happy environment for your nerves so you can continue to get better. One of the biggest contributing factors to pudendal neuralgia symptoms are static postures. What we define as static posture is if somebody is staying in the same position for longer than 15 minutes. We know that a lot of people with pudendal neuralgia get exacerbated symptoms with sitting. However, you can also be compromising yourself unintentionally when you stand in the same exact position for just a little bit too long. Ways to get around this would be to stand on something such as a piece of gardening foam that's going to provide a slightly unstable surface so you're shifting and moving moment to moment, avoiding standing in the same position, for example, at your standing desk for a little bit too long. You can also vary your sitting positions between a chair, between a certain type of cushion, between a physiotherapy ball. All of these variations will use different muscles which will allow other muscles to take a break as soon as you change into the next position. Keep in mind the general rule of thumb is roughly 15 minutes. If you're stuck in your car for 20 to 30 minutes, you can also shift from side to side. You can rotate the position of your pelvis forward and backwards just to provide some variance to which would otherwise be a static and possibly problematic posture. When people wear even the slightest heel, this actually dramatically changes the position of our pelvis. It tips our pelvis into an anterior position which lengthens the pudendal nerve and increases your pelvic floor tone. Both the lengthening of the pudendal nerve and the increase in pelvic floor tone can exacerbate the symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend wearing supportive sneakers all the time. Bare feet can also compromise the position of the pelvis in a similar way that heels can and therefore supportive sneakers are really the best choice. In our bodies, everything is connected. Therefore our ankle, knee and hip positions can also affect the pelvic floor and symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. People with pudendal neuralgia notice that they have trouble walking up hills. This happens for two different reasons. Number one, there's increasing amounts of hip flexion as you advance a leg up a hill which can tension the pudendal nerve. If your nerve can't slide, glide and move properly, this extra tension can provoke a symptom. Also when we are walking uphill, we have an increase in our pelvic floor muscle tone which can compress the nerve and cause a little bit of symptom in that manner as well. A tip to get around this because sometimes we can't avoid the hills are to actually turn around and walk backwards. This is going to shorten the pudendal nerve as well as activate the posterior muscles which actually allow your pelvic floor muscles to relax. Many people with pudendal neuralgia have noticed that core exercises increase their symptoms. It's helpful to understand why. When we do activities that raise our intra-abdominal pressure or activate our core, our pelvic floor muscles reflexively contract to support our bodies. If somebody has a pudendal nerve that's irritated, this contraction of the pelvic floor is going to further compress the nerve and cause a little bit of irritation that may show up in a delayed response. Therefore, we recommend working with your physical therapist to discover what time and place is actually appropriate for you to reintroduce these types of activities and that typically is after the nerve is less reactive to touch. Easily, this is identified in a physical therapy session. Lifting heavy objects will result in pelvic floor contractions to help stabilize our bodies which in turn can also exacerbate symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. We recommend finding ways to avoid lifting heavy objects. However, if you can't, we suggest doing diaphragmatic breathing and pelvic floor drops after lifting the heavy object assuming that that did make your pelvic floor muscles tighter for the moment. Doing diaphragmatic breathing or pelvic floor drops can help the muscles return to normal tone if you can't avoid lifting the heavy object. Pudendal neuralgia is a mechanical condition in which the nerve needs to be able to slide, glide, and move. In cases of symptoms, the nerve can't do that for some reason and it can happen at multiple points along its course through the pelvis. One of the key muscles that compresses the pudendal nerve is called the obturator internus. This is an external rotator of the hip. It tends to get tight and if that muscle is tight, it's going to impair our ability to either bend forward or raise our knees up to our hips. People will often notice that this does immediately cause maybe a shooting, stabbing pain in the territory of the nerve. Once we lengthen that muscle and get it to stop compressing the nerve, people can bend forward, they can bend over, and they can bring their knees up to their chest without a problem. But in order to do that, we need to restore the normal mechanics. If you notice that you're having trouble bending over or squatting down, there's a few little tips and strategies that you can do to make it a little more comfortable. When you have both feet planted on the ground, it's going to be more provocative for your pelvis and for the pudendal nerve. We suggest trying to slightly separate your legs or bend over using just one leg at a time. You can use assistive devices such as a grabber or your physical therapist can show you techniques specific to you to help avoid provoking your nerve. One thing people with pudendal neuralgia may not think about is their fluid intake. A symptom of pudendal neuralgia can include urinary urgency and frequency, which results in our desire to go to the bathroom when our bladders are not actually full. This is problematic for many reasons, but one of which is because it starts to retrain our body to send signals that we need to urinate at less than normal volumes. By adequately drinking 64 ounces of water a day, we will have a full bladder when we go to use the bathroom. This will help keep our normal reflexes in check as well as elicit a proper pelvic floor relaxation that cannot occur at lower bladder volumes. Speaking of our bowel and bladder habits, a squatty potty is a very effective tool for people with pudendal neuralgia. The squatty potty helps improve our pelvic floor alignment that allows any type of voiding behavior to be a little bit easier and we do recommend that for patients with pudendal neuralgia as well. Something that isn't talked about enough is how much emotional stress and rising cortisol levels actually can affect the pudendal nerve. It is the only nerve in the body that has sympathetic, sensory, and motor fibers, which means that this nerve is going to be more sensitive to emotional stress, but also provides an opportunity to help calm the irritation by strategies such as diaphragmatic breathing and meditation. We understand that most people cannot meditate at the times they may be feeling emotional stress, but actually taking a pause and doing five to six deep diaphragmatic breaths is known to help lower cortisol levels and thereby help restore a calmer environment for your nerve to function normally.

Additionally, the video does not suggest any further reading materials or mention other organizations that provide advice and information related to pudendal neuralgia. The only additional source mentioned is the organization's own services, without complete details."," 5

The video clearly discusses areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for pudendal neuralgia. It acknowledges that the appropriate time and place to reintroduce certain activities, such as core exercises, depends on the individual's condition and the reactivity of the nerve, which can be assessed during physical therapy sessions. The video also mentions that certain strategies, like using a squatty potty or separating the legs when bending over, may help avoid provoking the nerve, but it suggests consulting a physical therapist for techniques specific to the individual. Additionally, the video recognizes that emotional stress can affect the pudendal nerve and recommends strategies like diaphragmatic breathing and meditation, although it acknowledges that these may not be feasible during times of acute stress."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some details on how certain treatments or management strategies work for pudendal neuralgia, but it does not comprehensively describe the mechanisms of action for all the treatments mentioned.

The video explains the rationale behind strategies like avoiding static postures, wearing supportive shoes, modifying activities that increase pelvic floor tension (e.g., hill walking, core exercises, heavy lifting), addressing muscle tightness (e.g., obturator internus), using a squatty potty, and managing stress and cortisol levels. However, it does not delve into the specific physiological mechanisms by which these strategies alleviate pudendal neuralgia symptoms.

Additionally, the video does not provide details on how potential medical treatments, such as medications or interventional procedures, might work for pudendal neuralgia. Therefore, while the video offers some insights into the logic behind certain management approaches, it"," 3

fCqJ8XfcfVM,"Hi, my name is Dr. Ross Hauser. Welcome to Caring Medical Florida in Fort Myers, Florida. A common condition that we see is pelvic floor dysfunction, which causes, which can cause pudendal neuralgia or compression of the pudendal nerve. The most common treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction is actually different types of physical therapy. And often that is helpful, but very seldom do I find that it cures people. If somebody has really severe pudendal nerve pain, sometimes they actually even have surgical decompression. So the surgeon is trying to release the nerve surgically in the various parts of its path that can cause compression. What most people don't realize is that the pudendal nerve, the reason that the pudendal nerve gets stretched, gets compressed, gets irritated is because of pelvic instability. So I just want to explain how pelvic instability causes pudendal neuralgia and also pelvic floor dysfunction. So this is basically the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor is in between the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joints here. It's right here, the perineum. If you see here, this is actually the sciatic nerve. This is actually the sciatic nerve. So we all know the sciatic nerve goes in the back of the leg down to the foot, but most people don't realize these nerves, as you look in here, this is from the L5, S1, S2, S3 nerves. These nerves come out the sacrum. So the sacral nerves, the S1, the S2, the S3, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So I just want to show that. Okay, so you see like this is the sacrum. So this is the sacrum. See how the sacral nerves, the sacral nerves here, they're actually housed within the sacrum. So the most common reason the sacral nerves would get irritated is because the sacrum is moving too much. So some of these nerves come out the back, but then some of the nerves, some of the nerves, they're going to come out the front and then they're going to go into the perineum. One of those nerves is the pudendal nerve. You know, the nerves are coming out the front here. So some of these, the lower sacral nerves, the lower sacral nerves, they're going to form the pudendal nerve. That's what you see here. See how there it's going out of the sacrum and then it forms the pudendal nerve. So the question is what would cause the sacrum to rotate the sublux, to have too much movement where it actually is going to irritate these sacral nerves. Well the most common reason is going to be either sacroiliac ligament laxity or pubic symphysis laxity. Now sacroiliac laxity, in other words, the sacrum and the iliac crust, they move too much. So say a person had right pudendal neuralgia and what that would cause is unbelievable pain in the perineum and it often can be on one side. So terrible pain in the perineum. Well the pudendal nerve, the pudendal nerve, it goes between the sacrotuberous ligament and the sacrospinal ligament. Right here the pudendal nerve, to get into the pelvic inlet here, it goes between these two ligaments. So if somebody has laxity on one side, ligament laxity on one side, that would mean that there's going to be extra bony movement of this anomone bone on that side and the pudendal nerve can get entrapped between the sacrotuberous and the sacrospinous ligament. So the treatment then would be proper alignment of the anomone bone and also stabilization of the pelvic instability with prolotherapy.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0," 4

The speaker acknowledges that physical therapy, which is the most common treatment, is often helpful but ""very seldom"" cures the condition. He also mentions that surgical decompression is sometimes used for severe pudendal nerve pain, but he then goes on to explain his theory that the root cause is often pelvic instability, which is not addressed by these conventional treatments. The speaker's proposed treatment of prolotherapy for stabilizing the pelvic instability is presented as an alternative approach to address the underlying cause, implying that the existing treatment choices have limitations or uncertainties."," 3

Explanation: The video provides a partial description of how the treatments work. It explains in detail how pelvic instability and ligament laxity can lead to compression and irritation of the pudendal nerve, causing pudendal neuralgia and pelvic floor dysfunction. However, it does not provide specific details on how the treatments mentioned, such as physical therapy, surgical decompression, and prolotherapy, work to address the issue. The video focuses more on the underlying causes rather than the mechanisms of action of the treatments themselves."," 4

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments mentioned for pelvic floor dysfunction and pudendal neuralgia. It explains that physical therapy is often helpful but seldom cures the condition, and that surgical decompression is sometimes done for severe pudendal nerve pain to release the compressed nerve. However, the video does not explicitly describe the benefits of the main treatment approach discussed, which is prolotherapy for stabilizing pelvic instability and aligning the bones to relieve nerve compression. The benefits of this treatment are implied by discussing how it addresses the root cause of the condition, but specific benefits are not outlined."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the risks or potential complications associated with the treatments mentioned. It highlights that physical therapy is often not curative for pelvic floor dysfunction and severe pudendal nerve pain may require surgical decompression. However, it does not explicitly mention the potential risks or side effects of surgical decompression. The video primarily focuses on explaining the underlying causes of pudendal neuralgia and pelvic floor dysfunction, and how prolotherapy can help stabilize pelvic instability, which is proposed as a treatment approach. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate as risks are discussed for some treatments (physical therapy, surgical decompression mentioned but risks not detailed), but not for the prolotherapy treatment proposed."," 2

Explanation: The transcript mentions that physical therapy and surgical decompression are common treatments for pelvic floor dysfunction and pudendal neuralgia, but it does not explicitly describe the risks or benefits of forgoing treatment or watchful waiting. The focus is on explaining the potential causes of the condition and a proposed treatment approach (prolotherapy). While it implies that leaving the condition untreated could lead to continued nerve irritation and pain, it does not provide a clear description of the specific risks or benefits associated with a no-treatment option."," 2

The video provides some information about how treatment choices for pelvic floor dysfunction and pudendal neuralgia may affect overall quality of life, but the information is limited and not very detailed. It mentions that physical therapy is a common treatment but ""very seldom"" cures people, implying that quality of life may not improve significantly. It also mentions surgical decompression as an option for severe pudendal nerve pain, but does not discuss the potential impact on quality of life. The focus is primarily on explaining the underlying causes and the proposed treatment of prolotherapy and proper alignment, rather than detailing the effects on day-to-day activities or overall quality of life. Therefore, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate as the reference to quality of life in relation to treatment choices is unclear and incomplete."," 4

Explanation: The video partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for pelvic floor dysfunction and pudendal neuralgia. It mentions physical therapy as the most common treatment, but states that it seldom cures the condition. Surgical decompression is also mentioned as an option for severe pudendal nerve pain. However, the main focus of the video is on explaining the underlying cause of the condition (pelvic instability) and suggesting prolotherapy as a treatment to stabilize the pelvic area. While it acknowledges the existence of multiple treatment options, the video does not provide a detailed description of who might benefit from each option or under what circumstances one option might be preferred over the others."," 4

Explanation: The video provides some support for shared decision-making by suggesting discussing treatment options with health professionals. The doctor mentions that physical therapy and surgical decompression are common treatments for pudendal neuralgia but notes that these seldom cure the condition.

J4ObY48wdhU,"Hi there, I'm Dr. Britta Allgeier. I'm going to talk to you about the Pelvic Wand. This is a pelvic wand by Intimate Rose. I'm going to just give you a brief overview on how to use it. It is a little intimidating when you first see it, but it is a great, great, I can't say enough wonderful things about this. Once you get comfortable using it, you'll really love it. There obviously are two ends. Typically this is the end that we use rectally, and this is the end that we use vaginally. You can use whichever one you wish. I usually recommend starting with this end just because it's smaller. It's similar to the size of your finger. This one is great once you get comfortable using it because you can get to deeper muscles in your pelvic floor. It's got this nice curve so that you can angle it around. Whereas if you're trying to do that with your finger, it gets very hard to reach into those deeper muscles. For vaginally, we will start more with a superficial. This looks like a triangle. A lot of times you will work on these muscles when you're having pain with insertion, pain with intercourse, bladder pain. Believe it or not, there's a little muscle right underneath the labia that can spasm and it can feel just like a bladder infection. If you want to help alleviate that without taking medicine, if you do have a bladder infection, obviously you need to get that treated. When you go to the doctor and they tell you, you don't have a bladder infection, you're like, well, why does it feel like it? Well, because this muscle right here is spasming. Also, there's an area right here. We typically refer to it as a pelvic clock. This is 12, this is 6. This area is a great area to focus on as well when you're pregnant just because you want to lengthen the vaginal opening so that you don't have tearing right here. You can use this wand or your finger. You start by putting lubrication on it. We use slippery stuff, but you can use whichever you want. We recommend not using anything glycerin based or with any kind of added sugar ingredients because that can lead to infection, which we don't want. You put a little lubrication on here and then you'll just slowly go in. I like to start more at the bottom and work my way up, but you can start whichever way that is comfortable for you. You'll just go in and just gently pull. It's just like a pulling, lifting sensation. It shouldn't hurt. If you feel like a stingy burning sensation, just back off from the pressure. You just move along and it should just feel like a pulling sensation, a little bit of a stretching. You go around and then go to the other side. 10-15 seconds in each spot and deep breathing while you go on. Just inhale and exhale. Go through three breath cycles and then move your way around. This is more the superficial layer. To get to the deeper layer, these guys right in the bowl of your pelvis, you go in vaginally and then you'll go right over to these. If you have pain with deep penetration or near the hip muscles, going in deeper will help target those muscles. If you go in at 6 o'clock, you're going to hit more of these organs. This is your bladder. That's more at 12 o'clock. This is the vaginal opening. That's what you're going through. This is your rectum. If you feel a little pressure down here, you're hitting your rectum. You're not going to hurt anything, but it may feel like you have to go to the bathroom. If you come up at the 12 o'clock area, you'll hit your bladder. Again, it will just feel like you have to pee. Just go over to the side. The last part is using the Intimate Rose Wand rectally. The best position is on your side. You'll put the lubrication on. This is your tailbone. You're going to be angling right off to the side, both angles. This little muscle right here, this is your coccygeus. It's a little troublemaker. If you just gently go into that, you'll feel pressure. It's typically tight. Just hang out there. You just go in slowly. You're pulling and lifting. Again, if you have discomfort or it's painful, just back off on the pressure. Deep breathe. You just move around every 10-15 seconds. If there's a target area that feels really tight, just hang out there and do some deep breathing. Then you'll go to the other side as well. I hope that helps. I recommend starting with a pelvic floor therapist just to figure out what it's going to feel like. We can go over how to use this in our office and guide you through it. Also, make sure that you're using it correctly. I hope that helps and takes away the anxiety of using this. It's a wonderful tool and it can really help alleviate pain.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0," 4

kGMdnS8mFSQ,"My name is Robert Williams 63 years old I'm also a patient of Dr. Elkwood’s. If found him in a long journey trying to find doctors who could help my issue that was started in 2013 with the diagnosis of prostate cancer diagnosis started in 2013 when I went to the doctor for a physical. normal yearly physical and when they blood work came back my talk to you phone me that my PSA where above normal. I've never had any issues regarding anything and she explained to me that the essay was a test on the prostate to determine if there was something wrong with it no one day did the biopsies came back positive so we decided to go with the seeds the seeds in the stage work you can go about your business and they slowly kill the cancer or a two and a half months. The day of the procedure came and went in and I was told the only place that I would hurt was when the procedure was supposed to go where they put the needles in but when I woke up and there's something drastically if I'm wrong so I went home for the weekend pain was unforgivable it was like somebody had set a burning Amber into my pelvic area so Monday we made an appointment to go back to the doctor Tuesday they did a re scan and it showed that six seeds were floating around my bladder basically burning everything it touched we also found five seeds that were in the Pudendal Nerve area Wednesday when they went back in to take the seeds that were in my bladder out but they did not take the seeds that were In my Pudendal Nerve they thought they would do more damage by taking them out then just leaving them in. Our next stop was a hospital in Tampa Florida Pain management doctors there relayed that there was a procedure called radio frequency ablation. It lasted about nine months. Unfortunately the procedure also causes damage because of scar tissue so that procedure Worked which was great I mean- you know - it did great and after nine months the pain came back. So from that point on the pain started skyrocketing my girlfriend Kathy found Dr. Elkwood and we called him and sent him all of the information. He looked it over I am going to tell you right now it wasn't easy he made you jump through hoops to make sure this is exactly one that you want to do He made me do a lot of tests and wanted to make sure exactly what was going on which I was gladly to do and flying see Dr. Elkwood, I’m live in Florida and he's a New Jersey. It was a- it was painful - very very painful. But we did it cause he he seemed to us this lie that he was serious about it and he said thought he could do something about it we met with them a couple times and it decided to do the procedure we went ahead in micro surgically released the pudendal nerve and surrounding nerves in that area in the just outside the area of the prostate the area that had been radiated as well Even in the medical community very few know that are very good treatment options for Pudendal Neuralgia. Dr. Elkwood when he went in he took out all of the radiation damage, all of the damage that was called by the radio frequency ablations. Uh and got the nerves to fire correctly. So as I like to tell Robert, he’s in the “W” column. He’s in the win column, and he really did exceptionally well. Thank God that Kathy found him, I’m telling you, it’s a life changing situation.",Pudendal Nerve,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0," 3

The transcript partially explains the aims of the video. While it provides background information about the speaker's medical condition and treatment journey, it does not explicitly state the overall purpose or aims of the video itself. The aims can be inferred to be raising awareness about pudendal neuralgia, a rare condition caused by nerve damage, and highlighting the expertise of Dr. Elkwood in treating this condition surgically. However, these aims are not clearly and directly stated in the transcript."," 4

The video transcript provides a detailed account of Robert Williams' journey with prostate cancer and the subsequent complications he faced, including pudendal neuralgia. It outlines the various treatments he underwent, such as radiation therapy, seed implantation, and radio frequency ablation, and their associated side effects. The transcript highlights the challenges he faced in finding an effective treatment until he consulted with Dr. Elkwood, who performed a microsurgical release of the pudendal nerve and surrounding nerves, ultimately providing relief from his debilitating pain.

While the transcript does not explicitly state the aims of the video, it seems to aim at raising awareness about pudendal neuralgia, a lesser-known condition, and the potential treatment options available, particularly the surgical approach undertaken by Dr. Elkwood. The personal account and the positive outcome described in the transcript achieve this objective to a considerable extent."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides relevant information about the speaker's experience with prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent complications involving nerve damage and chronic pain. It discusses the challenges faced in finding an effective treatment and the positive outcome achieved through Dr. Elkwood's surgical intervention for pudendal neuralgia. However, the transcript does not provide comprehensive medical details or address potential questions readers might have about prostate cancer, its causes, symptoms, and various treatment options. The information is largely anecdotal and focused on the speaker's personal journey."," 3

The transcript mentions some sources of information, but not in a comprehensive or explicit manner. It mentions that the patient's girlfriend found Dr. Elkwood, and that Dr. Elkwood performed certain procedures, but there are no direct references to research studies or expert opinions that informed the treatment approach. The patient describes his personal experience and the steps taken by Dr. Elkwood, but the sources of evidence behind the medical decisions are not clearly stated. Therefore, I would rate the video as partially clear in terms of citing sources of evidence, hence a score of 3."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about the timeline of events related to the patient's medical condition, starting from the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2013. However, there are no specific dates mentioned for the various treatments, procedures, or when the patient encountered Dr. Elkwood. The only date explicitly stated is 2013 for the initial diagnosis. Therefore, while the overall timeline is partially clear, the lack of specific dates for the acknowledged sources (treatments, procedures, doctors) means that the video cannot be rated as a 5 for clarity in terms of dating the information sources. Hence, a score of 2 is appropriate, indicating that only the date of the initial diagnosis is clear, while dates for other key events and sources are missing."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript appears to be a personal account of the patient's experience with prostate cancer treatment and the resulting complications, specifically pudendal neuralgia. While it primarily focuses on the patient's journey and the positive outcome achieved through Dr. Elkwood's treatment, it lacks a balanced representation of alternative treatment options or a broader discussion of the condition from a more objective standpoint. The information is presented from a single patient's perspective, without reference to other research studies or expert opinions. However, the transcript does not come across as overly sensational or alarmist in its tone. Overall, while the information is compelling from a personal experience standpoint, it lacks the objectivity and breadth of sources typically expected in a truly balanced and unbiased medical presentation."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not provide any details of additional sources of support or information related to the medical condition discussed (pudendal neuralgia and complications from prostate cancer treatment). The transcript only focuses on the personal experience and treatment journey of the patient, Robert Williams, and his doctor, Dr. Elkwood. There are no suggestions for further reading or mentions of other organizations that could provide advice or information on the topic."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for prostate cancer and associated complications. It discusses the journey of the patient, Robert Williams, in finding effective treatment options for his condition, which involved trying different procedures and facing setbacks. The transcript mentions that ""even in the medical community, very few know that there are very good treatment options for Pudendal Neuralgia,"" highlighting the lack of knowledge or consensus regarding appropriate treatments. Overall, the transcript portrays the difficulties and uncertainties faced by the patient in finding a suitable treatment, ultimately leading to the successful intervention by Dr. Elkwood."," 3

Explanation:
The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments work, but it lacks clear explanations for most of the treatments mentioned. It describes how the radioactive seeds were intended to slowly kill the cancer cells, and that the radiofrequency ablation procedure caused scar tissue damage. However, it does not explain the mechanisms of action for the biopsies, the microsurgical nerve release procedure performed by Dr. Elkwood, or the removal of radiation-damaged tissue. The descriptions are incomplete or unclear for several of the treatments discussed. Therefore, a score of 3 (Partially) is appropriate, as the video only partially describes how the treatments work on the body."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of some treatments for the patient's condition. It mentions that the seed implant procedure initially worked to kill the prostate cancer, but later caused complications with seeds migrating and causing pain. The radio frequency ablation procedure provided pain relief for about 9 months before the pain returned. Finally, the microsurgical release of the pudendal nerve and surrounding nerves performed by Dr. Elkwood is described as successfully treating the radiation damage and nerve issues, allowing the nerves to ""fire correctly"" and providing relief, which is a clear benefit. However, the benefits of the initial cancer treatment (apart from the seed implant complications) and any follow-up treatments after the radio frequency ablation are not described."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks of the treatments mentioned. It discusses the complications and adverse reactions Robert Williams experienced after the seed implantation procedure for his prostate cancer, such as severe pain and the seeds migrating to his bladder and pudendal nerve area. However, it does not explicitly mention the potential risks or side effects associated with the radio frequency ablation procedure or the microsurgical pudendal nerve release performed by Dr. Elkwood. The transcript focuses more on Robert's personal experience and journey rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the risks involved with each treatment option."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks and benefits associated with postponing or forgoing treatment for prostate cancer. It mentions that the patient initially opted for seed implantation (brachytherapy) as a treatment option, but complications arose, leading to severe pain and subsequent procedures like radio frequency ablation. However, these treatments also caused further damage and scarring, and the pain persisted. The patient then sought out Dr. Elkwood's expertise, who performed a surgical procedure to release the affected nerves. While the transcript does not explicitly discuss the risks or benefits of watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment, it implies the potential consequences of delaying or avoiding treatment through the patient's experience of complications and ongoing pain. The information provided is relevant but not comprehensive in addressing the specific question."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes how the treatment choices affected the overall quality of life. While it does not explicitly use the phrase ""quality of life,"" it mentions the significant pain and discomfort experienced by the patient due to the initial radiation treatment and subsequent procedures. The patient describes the pain as ""unforgivable"" and ""skyrocketing,"" indicating a negative impact on his daily life. However, after finding Dr. Elkwood and undergoing the microsurgical procedure, the patient expresses relief and gratitude, implying an improvement in his quality of life. The information provided is somewhat limited, but it does give an idea of how the treatments affected the patient's day-to-day experience."," 4

Explanation: The transcript partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for the patient's condition. It mentions several treatments that the patient underwent, such as brachytherapy (seed implants), radio frequency ablation, and eventually the surgical procedure performed by Dr. Elkwood. However, the transcript does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances each treatment would be appropriate. It mainly focuses on the patient's personal experience and journey through different treatments. While it suggests that Dr. Elkwood's surgical approach was successful for this particular case, it does not explicitly discuss alternative treatments or suggest investigating further options before deciding on a particular treatment."," 4

The video provides some support for shared decision-making. While it does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment options with family, friends, or healthcare professionals, it portrays the patient's journey in seeking medical help and highlights the importance of finding a doctor who takes the time to understand the patient's condition and explore appropriate treatment options. The patient mentions that the doctor ""made you jump through hoops to make sure this is exactly what you want to do"" and ""made me do a lot of tests and wanted to make sure exactly what was going on,"" implying a collaborative approach to decision-making. Additionally, the patient's partner is mentioned as being involved in the process of finding the right doctor, suggesting some level of shared decision-making within the patient's support system.",set()
ykWPPGNuHZk,"If you are having pain in your clitoris, penis, scrotum, labia, perineum, or anus- especially when sitting, your doctors have ruled out infections, & they're not sure what's wrong with you you might have Pudendal Neuralgia. In this video we are going to talk about what Pudendal Neuralgia is, how people get it, and why physical therapy is such an important part of someone's treatment plan to help recover from this syndrome. If you suspect you have Pudendal Neuralgia, one of the questions you need to ask is- Is it on one side of my body or both? We have a pudendal nerve on the right, we have a pudendal nerve on the left. And commonly when it starts to get activated & turns into a neuralgia, it's going to affect one side more than the other. It's important to differentiate neuralgia symptoms from muscle aches and pains. And so typically, neuralgias (whether it's pudendal or elsewhere) have sharp, shooting, stabbing pain versus ""I feel a little achy, I feel a little sore."" That's different. We're really looking along the path of the nerve to see that it's neuropathic in nature. And by neuropathic, we mean: burning, throbbing, aching, stabbing. The Pudendal Nerve is unique because it is one of the only peripheral nerves in the body that has sensory fibers, motor fibers, and autonomic. Which means automatic fibers too, in addition to the pain that accompanies Pudendal Nerve the pudendal nerve is involved in a number of reflexes that are tied to orgasm, bowel movements, and urinary function. So people may also experience urinary urgency, frequency, burning with urination ,painful ejaculation, inability to orgasm, or difficulty with bowel movements & pain associated with bowel movements. There's a wide range of reasons why people develop Pudendal Nerve, and for some people it can be one of the things I'm about to mention or a combination of a few. So if we're looking at some of the general categories, we can start with compression. This means the people who are cyclists, who ride horses, or who sit for long periods of time during the day. Going in the opposite direction, there can also be tension injuries. So this is more commonly associated with things like: long second stages of labor, or chronic constipation, or certain types of exercise that involve deep & excessive ranges of motion with the hip & lumbar spine. The next category can be associated with surgical trauma. So for various pelvic floor conditions, whether it's prostatectomy or pelvic floor reconstruction for different types of prolapse, there can be a surgical insult somewhere along the path of the pudendal nerve. And finally there can be traumatic issues that affect the pudendal nerves; such as car accidents or falling on top of various items in your lawn or in the yard that can basically cause an injury in or around the congenital nerve space. Because there's so many different reasons why somebody has pudendal neuralgia, it's really important to get down to their anatomy and physiology to figure out what is causing their symptoms. So regardless of the mechanism of how it developed, the next phase is to figure out- is there muscle dysfunction, is there tissue dysfunction, what is happening along the course of someone's pudendal nerve that does not allow the nerve to move, glide, and slide the way it should, therefore resulting in symptoms. So unfortunately the people you think to go to when you have symptoms of pudendal neuralgia (a gynecologist, a urologist, potentially a neurologist) are really not the people equipped to evaluate why someone has pudendal neuralgia. Which really leads into the expertise of a pelvic floor physical therapist and physical therapists who can identify various muscles tissues and reasons why the nerve is compromised. So physical therapy is so important for pudendal neuralgia because what will happen during evaluation with a physical therapist compared to a swab or a culture or something that happens on the medical side, is the physical therapist is going to do a history to help identify potential mechanisms as to why their nerve got irritated. But then also do a very specific physical exam that is going to look at movement patterns, muscle tone in the pelvic floor, and the pelvic girdle muscles, trigger points, tissue issues, and reasons that are going to compromise the nerve anywhere along its course. Which runs basically from the sacrum through the pelvic floor to all the different areas we mentioned initially (the clitoris, the penis, the scrotum, the labia, the perineum and the anus). There are various places along the course of the nerve that can get compromised. Certain people may have compromise along the entire track of the nerve. Certain people may only have compromise in one little spot. The physical exam and the movement exam that physical therapists can do will help identify each individual person's causes for why they're having the symptoms that they're having.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0," 4

The video transcript provides a fairly clear indication of its aims, which are to discuss pudendal neuralgia, its causes, symptoms, and the importance of physical therapy in treating it. It covers the definition of pudendal neuralgia, potential reasons for its development (compression, tension injuries, surgical trauma, and traumatic issues), its symptoms (pain, urinary issues, sexual dysfunction, and bowel problems), and the role of physical therapy in identifying and addressing the underlying causes. However, the aims could have been stated more explicitly and concisely at the beginning, rather than being gradually revealed throughout the transcript. Overall, the aims are present but not perfectly clear and concise."," 4

The video transcript provides a comprehensive overview of Pudendal Neuralgia, including its definition, symptoms, potential causes, and the importance of physical therapy in treating this condition. It covers the key aspects one would expect from a description of Pudendal Neuralgia, such as the role of the pudendal nerve, the types of pain associated with the condition, and the various mechanisms that can lead to its development. However, it does not delve into specific treatment modalities or exercises that physical therapists might employ, which could have provided a more complete picture of the management of this condition. Overall, the transcript achieves its aims of explaining Pudendal Neuralgia and the rationale for physical therapy intervention, but could have been more comprehensive in detailing the specific physical therapy treatment approach."," 5

The video transcript is highly relevant and addresses the questions that readers might have regarding pudendal neuralgia. It provides a comprehensive overview of the condition, including its causes, symptoms, and the importance of physical therapy in the treatment plan. The transcript covers key aspects such as the anatomy of the pudendal nerve, potential compression or tension injuries that can lead to pudendal neuralgia, and the role of physical therapists in identifying and addressing the underlying causes through a thorough evaluation and examination. The information provided is detailed and informative, making it a valuable resource for those seeking to understand this condition."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some references to potential sources of information, but these are mainly general statements without specific citations. For example, it mentions that certain factors like cycling, horseback riding, prolonged sitting, childbirth, constipation, and trauma can contribute to pudendal neuralgia, but it does not reference any specific studies or experts as the source of this information. The video also emphasizes the importance of physical therapy evaluation and treatment for pudendal neuralgia, but again, it does not cite any particular sources to support this claim. Overall, while the video provides some potentially credible information, it lacks clear and specific references to the sources of evidence used to compile the content."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not provide any clear dates for the sources of information used to compile the video content. While the video itself seems to be discussing current information about Pudendal Neuralgia, its causes, symptoms, and treatment through physical therapy, there are no specific dates mentioned for any referenced studies, research papers, or other sources that may have been consulted in creating this educational video. Without any dates provided for the sources of information, it is not possible to determine how current or dated the information presented in the video may be."," 4

It covers a range of potential reasons for the condition, including compression, tension injuries, surgical trauma, and traumatic incidents. The information is presented from an objective point of view, with references to various experts and sources of information.

However, there is a slight bias towards promoting physical therapy as the primary treatment approach, without extensively discussing other potential treatment options or their relative effectiveness. The video could have been more balanced by providing more information on alternative or complementary treatments, such as medication or surgical interventions, and their respective pros and cons.

Overall, the video is largely unbiased and objective, providing a well-rounded understanding of Pudendal Neuralgia, but it could have been more balanced by exploring a broader range of treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details about seeking help from a pelvic floor physical therapist for evaluating and treating pudendal neuralgia, but it does not provide information about any additional sources or organizations beyond physical therapy. The video focuses solely on the role of physical therapy in diagnosing and managing pudendal neuralgia, without mentioning other potential resources or support systems for individuals suffering from this condition. Therefore, based on the given criteria, a score of 2 (Partially) is appropriate, as the video does not provide complete details of additional sources of information or support beyond local physical therapy services."," 5

The transcript clearly refers to areas of uncertainty and gaps in knowledge regarding the treatment choices for Pudendal Neuralgia. It mentions that there are various reasons why someone may develop Pudendal Neuralgia, and it is important to identify the specific cause for each individual patient to determine the appropriate treatment approach. The transcript emphasizes the importance of physical therapy in evaluating and treating Pudendal Neuralgia, as medical professionals such as gynecologists, urologists, and neurologists may not be equipped to identify the underlying causes and recommend the right treatment. The transcript acknowledges that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the treatment plan needs to be tailored to the individual's anatomy, physiology, and the specific factors contributing to their symptoms."," 3

The transcript provides some details on how certain treatments, particularly physical therapy, work to address pudendal neuralgia. It explains that physical therapists can identify and address muscle dysfunction, tissue dysfunction, and issues that may be compromising the pudendal nerve's ability to move and function properly. However, the transcript does not go into specific details on how other potential treatments, such as medications or surgical interventions, might work to alleviate pudendal neuralgia symptoms. The focus is primarily on the role of physical therapy in identifying and addressing the underlying causes of nerve compression or irritation."," 3

Explanation: The transcript provides some information about the benefits of physical therapy treatment for Pudendal Neuralgia, but it does not describe the benefits of other potential treatments mentioned, such as medication or surgery. The benefits of physical therapy described include identifying the underlying causes of the condition, addressing muscle dysfunction, tissue dysfunction, and issues that may be compromising the nerve's movement. However, the transcript does not explicitly state how these interventions help control or eliminate symptoms, prevent recurrence, or eliminate the condition in the short or long term.

AZbkolcvYVQ,"What is pudendal neuralgia? That's the subject of this video. Stay tuned. Hey, this is Dr. Shakti from Core Pelvic Floor Therapy right here in Irvine, Orange County. Pudendal neuralgia is a commonly, I mean if you know about the term, chances are you probably have that. The reason I'm doing this video is because I wish people would catch it before it becomes a full blown issue. What is happening here with pudendal neuralgia is you have the nerves coming from the lower part of your sacrum area. And then it goes through into the inside and it goes through these different landmarks within your pelvis, the ilium part of your pelvis. And then it goes, it branches off. So you've got the pudendal nerve which is an offshoot of the sacral nerve and then it branches into three sections. One goes to the penis and vulva, the other one goes into your anal area and the third one goes to the space in between. So you can have entrapment, you can have irritation and inflammation of this nerve from the site of origin which is the lower part of your spine and sacrum all the way to those three areas that I mentioned. The issue with pudendal neuralgia is by the time they diagnose it, there's been too much time that has been spent. That's been pretty much wasted. And then there are these blocks, it has to respond positively when the nerve is blocked and then they can say, okay this is pudendal neuralgia. Go see a pelvic floor therapist for it. It's hard to reach certain parts depending on where the irritation is. And many times you're basically, it's like okay you've got to live with it. So when is a good time to catch it? Is if you have chronic lower back pelvic pain. When I say pelvic pain, I'm not talking about pain in your penis or vagina. I'm talking about pain in the pelvic area, in the pelvis, in the SI joint. If you have chronic hip issues, those are great reasons why the pelvis itself loses its balance and stability. So all structures, not just any soft tissue like a nerve, but all structures become compromised. So if it happens to be your pudendal nerve or a branch of the nerves exiting your spine or your sacral area, then that will be the issue. Pudendal neuralgia should not be a life sentence. But it's very easy to get distracted in the course of the treatment and a lot of time goes by. And by the time the final conclusion is made, it may be a little too late. So you kind of have that lingering pain or pain for the rest of your life. So it's very important to catch yourself. Don't disregard pain in your sacroiliac joint, in the lumbar area, lower back area, in your hips. Don't disregard them. Don't look at them like, oh, that's not related to this thing. People should look into these things more carefully. And the most important part is to make sure you see the right person for treatment. A lot of times when you go to see a medical doctor, they write off those areas like lower back, SI, and hip problems as an orthopedic problem. So go get some physical therapy or go see a chiropractor. Well, that's not enough because if the examination is not very much specific to rule out pudendal nerve subtle symptoms, then it's very easy to miss it and then it becomes a huge problem. I hope this video is making you realize how important it is to see the right type of provider and do not disregard subtle symptoms as if they have no value. Sorry about that. If you have any questions, make sure you use one of the methods of contact in the description box. Contact my office. Let's talk and see what's going on. Hope this helps.

6axdhKqkoIg,"Pudendal neuralgia. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that both men and ladies can get. It's caused by an irritation or an over-activation of the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the nerves that comes off the nerve roots at the base of the spine. It's formed from the branches of L2, 3 and 4 and comes off part of the sciatic nerve. The pudendal nerve is quite unusual because it carries both sensory and motor fibres. That means it tells the muscles that it innovates what to do and also it carries sensations, so pain, touch, temperature and so on. It's got some autonomic function as well. Autonomic means the automatic processes that our bodies are involved with. That can be things like bowel function, it can be involved a little bit with bladder control, it can also be involved with sexual function such as orgasms or erections. People who struggle with pudendal neuralgia usually have pain associated with an irritation of the areas that the pudendal nerve supplies the sensation to. That's generally your pelvic floor which is what I would consider the underhand saddle area of your bottom and your genitalia. You can also have some shooting pains occasionally and going down your legs. If this nerve becomes irritated or over-activated you can experience quite severe neuropathic pain, sharp shooting, burning pain. Because you have two pudendal nerves, one on the left and one on the right, often the pain can be more predominantly on one side than the other. But it's not uncommon to have pain on both sides, particularly if the process that's resulting in that occurs in both. Nobody knows exactly why people get pudendal neuralgia but sometimes it can be caused by stretching of the pudendal nerve, particularly in cyclists who adopt a position where the pudendal nerve can be stretched. It can also be caused by sitting down for very long periods of time and we all know that as a society in general now we tend to sit a lot more than we ever did before. It can be caused by trauma, particularly during things like childbirth or labour if there's a long second stage. Or it can be caused by just a very, very tight pelvic floor. So that's the muscles that supply and hold the internal organs down through the bottom of your genitalia and things like that. There's also some suggestions that irritation or activation of your pudendal nerve can be caused by hormones such as going through menopause or even indeed endometriosis. So pudendal neuralgia is really quite a debilitating condition because you can have sharp shooting burning pain at any time, can be unprovoked and is made worse by sitting down. Quite often the pain is relieved by standing up or lying down and sleeping and things. But it's not always relieved by that and quite often sleep at night can be really quite disturbed with it, which is often the case with a lot of chronic pain conditions. Because the pudendal nerve supplies the muscles of the pelvic floor, so that's the muscles underneath that hold your internal organs up and in, if the pudendal nerve gets irritated or activated that causes these muscles to get really, really tight. And we all know that when you get tight muscles, if you get tight in your shoulders, the tighter they become, the more the pain evolves, the worse the pain becomes. And these muscles then squeeze really tight and because the pudendal nerve comes out as three branches and it forms an almost finger-like projection through these muscles, the tighter these muscles squeeze together, if the nerve is going through it, these nerve branches of the pudendal nerve then get squeezed and tightened even further. And so you can quite easily fall into this vicious, vicious circle where you've got pain, the muscles get tighter because of the pain that's there and that squeezes the nerves even more, which causes more pain and more tightening of the muscles. So it's one of these conditions, if we want to try and treat it, we need to try and break it down and we need to look at medication and predominantly anti-lerve pain medication, so the anti-lerve painkillers. We need to look at those to try and relieve the irritability and the wound up nature of the nerve pain. We also want to look at some physiotherapy, particularly looking at the pelvic floor, trying to relax the muscles of the pelvic floor and then potentially looking at any other therapies that can reduce the over-activation of the nervous system, whether that's psychological therapies or just simple relaxation exercises. And often the condition can be brought back to a much, much more manageable state. Very occasionally we can do injections, particularly if it's really, really severe, to try and just relax the muscles and to reduce the irritability of the nerve.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0," 4 (Partially)

The focus is more on describing the condition itself and mentioning potential treatments in a general way. There is no clear comparison or discussion of how the various treatment options may differentially impact day-to-day functioning and quality of life."," 4

The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for pudendal neuralgia. It mentions several potential treatment options, including medication (anti-nerve pain medication), physiotherapy (particularly for relaxing the pelvic floor muscles), psychological therapies, relaxation exercises, and occasional injections for severe cases. However, the video does not provide a clear description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances each option should be considered. The information about treatment choices is present but lacks detailed guidance on selecting the appropriate treatment based on individual factors."," 3

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the video does not explicitly suggest discussing treatment options with doctors or health professionals, it does mention various treatment approaches, such as medication (anti-nerve pain medication), physiotherapy for pelvic floor relaxation, psychological therapies, relaxation exercises, and occasional injections for severe cases. By mentioning these different treatment modalities, the video indirectly implies that patients may need to discuss these options with their healthcare providers to determine the best course of action. However, the video does not directly encourage patients to engage in shared decision-making or to consult with their support network (family, friends) regarding treatment choices.",set()

f1uroxfbRs4,"So, pudendal neuralgia is this neuropathic pain condition that affects the pudendal nerve. So what happens is that patients who have this condition will have a lot of pain in their rectum, perineum, vagina or clitoris or menopenis and scrotum. It's a very severe neuropathic type of pain so it affects our quality of life. It causes a lot of suffering. Most patients get this from some sort of accident or trauma so either a fall, a surgery or something that can have a direct impact or injury to the pelvis. So there are some patients who cannot sit or they cannot stand because of it and those are usually the most severe presentation of this. And the next steps would be is finding out if there's something that is kind of reversible or maybe what the cause was of the pudendal neuralgia and sometimes we treat the cause and things may get better. If everything has looked so far looked fine, there's no underlying cause, this may be someone where surgical decompression of the pudendal nerve may help them. I think the best way of early diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is knowing about it. I think that as the word goes out and physicians start recognizing the symptoms, it tends to be a very easy diagnosis. So this should be considered in anybody who is having pain when they sit and who feels better when they're standing. And if their sole complaint is I'm having this pain, the pain is in my genital areas and I can't sit, I think that is, you should start thinking about pudendal neuralgia.

oCxK0at4NFc,"If you're suffering from pain in the pelvic or genital area, and have seen numerous specialists but despite that no cause can be found, then this video on Pudendal Neuralgia might provide you with some useful information. The main aim of my making this video is to raise awareness about this condition, not only amongst the patients but also amongst the medical fraternity. Hi I'm Dr. Amod Manocha. I'm a pain specialist and I work at the Max Hospital in Delhi as the head of the pain management services. Let me describe a typical patient who presents to my clinic with this problem. So most patients who present to my clinic would be young or middle aged male or female patients with pelvic pain. Before they come to my clinic they have normally seen numerous specialists which may include neurologists, general surgeons, neurologists, gynecologists and often internal medicine specialists. They've had numerous investigations but despite that no cause can be found which can explain their pain symptoms. And often their life is at a standstill because it affects not only their working capacity but also their sitting ability and their sexual life. These patients have normally done a lot of internet research before they can come to the diagnosis or come to the suspicion that pudendal nerve might be the problem in their case. So let me describe the symptoms which these patients present. So the main presenting complaint is pelvic pain which may feel like a burning, shooting, aching sensation and this may be located in the genital area such as the penis or the scrotum or the vagina or the labia or the perineal area. The perineal area is the area high up in between the two legs. The pain may also be located close to the sit bones and often it goes down on the inner side of the leg. Now this pain is associated with urinary symptoms and most patients describe it as if they have got a urinary infection which means they say they have to go to pass urine more often. There is often pain while they are passing urine accompanied by a burning sensation. Along with this they may have bowel symptoms or stool symptoms such as increased urge to open bowels, irritation or itching sensation around the area when they are passing stool or even pain when they are passing stool. Along with this one of the other major symptoms is sexual dysfunction which means they have pain when they are aroused, when they are having intercourse or when they are having an orgasm. They can in males especially, there can be pain after ejaculation as well and you can understand the implications of this and how this can affect the life of people. Before we move any further I think it is important to know a little bit more about the pudendal nerve. So pudendal nerve is one of the major nerves in the pelvis and there is one on each side. Now this nerve has an important role in controlling the urine and the stool control and it also carries the sensation to the genital area. So let me explain you a little bit more with the help of this animation model. So if I remove the skin and the muscles and the yellow ones you see are the nerves. Now the one which I have highlighted is the pudendal nerve and you can appreciate that it comes out of the spine and travels towards the front. If I rotate the spine then you can see this clearly and this nerve which you see is the pudendal nerve. Now to help you understand and appreciate it a little bit more let me isolate the nerve. So what you see now is the pudendal nerve coming out of the spine and then travelling forwards and during its course it will give different branches which will go to different areas like the rectal area, the genital area and the perineal area. So if I put the skin back then you will be able to appreciate where this nerve is located and what's its course. Let's move further and talk about what can cause the pudendal neuralgia symptoms. So any pressure on the nerve as while cycling or bike riding or prolonged sitting can lead to the appearance of the typical symptoms and often for this reason this condition is also known as the Cyclist's Syndrome. Training of the nerve as during childbirth can also lead to the typical symptoms. Other causes of pudendal neuralgia can include injury to the nerve as well as a surgery or a trauma or infections in the area such as herpes. Now this condition can be quite challenging to diagnose and what we sometimes use is special MRI scans to look at these nerves. Depending on the availability we may also use nerve conduction tests and these are special tests but what can help us diagnose with a little bit more confidence is diagnostic nerve blocks. So if we numb these nerves with the help of injections and the pain goes away then that can be a clue to the diagnosis. So for treating this condition what we use is a multidisciplinary approach which means we use different modalities together to try and give you the maximum benefit from it. We have to undertake some lifestyle modifications which are aimed at protecting the nerve giving it an opportunity to heal. Now these lifestyle modifications include using a special cushion while we are sitting, avoiding tight throats to avoid pressure on the nerve, avoiding constipation so that the nerve does not get further damaged, avoiding things like bike riding, avoiding things like horse riding and prolonged sitting. Along with this what we use is physiotherapy aimed at specifically the pelvic floor muscles. We also use medications which are special type of medications which works on the nerves and are called neuropathic medications. Now these medications can take some time to produce their effect and often we have to start with the lower dose and then gradually increase the dose till you get the benefits from it. Another important modality what we use in the treatment is injections. We have discussed before how these injections can help us in confirming the diagnosis and also they can help in providing relief. Now the initial injections which we often do are nerve blocks and these are performed under either x-ray guidance or ultrasound guidance. Sometimes we have to combine the two modalities that is the x-rays and the ultrasound to locate the nerve and to block the nerve. If this gives you prolonged relief that's very good, if it doesn't then we use another modality which is called pulse radiofrequency where we are using the radiofrequency to prolong the effect of the pain relief or the nerve block. Sometimes along with these we also use trigger point injections in the pelvic muscles which means we are trying to subdue the trigger points in the pelvic muscles which might be causing more pain and flare ups. So thank you for listening to me and I hope whatever I have said is useful to you and if you have any questions please do post them in the comment section and I will try and answer them.

CpOzLBcxntA,"Hi there, it's Kathy Cates and Melissa Hines from the Institute for Pelvic Health. And you're watching Demystifying the Pelvic Floor, weekly videos providing real and simplified pelvic floor education for real clinical situations. We've got you covered. And today we'll be talking about pudendal neuralgia and why you should consider the pelvic floor muscles. What is the pudendal nerve and what is pudendal neuralgia? So the pudendal nerve, as you can see from this photo, runs on bilateral sides of the pelvic floor muscles and innervates the clitoris, perineum, labia, and anal sphincter. The pudendal nerve can become compressed, irritated, inflamed, which can lead to neuralgia of that nerve. It's a subset of vulvodynia and it can cause pain in the nerve distribution. This will present with one-sided burning, itching, tingling, with penetrative sex, or the feeling of having something inside of the perineum or rectum or that feeling of fullness. The symptoms get worse when bowels are full. Symptoms will often increase during a bowel movement as the pudendal nerve stretches. Burning may continue post bowel movement and can last for several minutes to hours. The same goes for any sort of penetrative sex or just stimulation. It can also present after orgasm or during orgasm, but that's kind of the hallmark sign of if someone has an orgasm and the symptoms come up, you know, a couple minutes after. Another big thing is symptoms that get worse with long car rides, sitting, or cycling because of the pressure on the pudendal nerve. So spinning, cycling are all, that's definitely a risk factor for pudendal neuralgia. Some other ones include vaginal birth, physiotomy, any kind of trauma to the coccyx, even a fall on the tailbone, pelvic surgeries, herniated discs, parlov cysts, and hypertonic pelvic floor muscles. So anything that's going to be putting pressure on the spine and the sacral nerve roots. And through palpating the obturator internus muscle, you can stimulate the pudendal nerve. And if it reproduces the patient's symptoms or creates a zinging and a referral into the distribution of the nerve, then that's considered what we call a positive Tenel sign or a neuropathic irritation that could be causing some of the patient's symptoms. So there are Tenel signs within the pelvic floor, just like we're so used to thinking about it, like with the wrist and when we check for carpal tunnel, but there's also a Tenel sign for the pelvic floor muscle. So treatments of pudendal neuralgia, your bimanual exam by identifying that zing is the first and crucial step. You can refer those patients to pelvic floor therapy, diaphragmatic breathing to get the whole pelvic floor muscles to relax. Think about activity modifications, seat cushions with a cutout can often make a very, very big difference. If more conservative measures aren't working, you can think about pudendal nerve blocks, even Botox injections right into the pelvic floor muscles, specifically the levator ani muscles. And there's mixed evidence, but sometimes worth trying oral medications, pregavalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants and FNRIs. But again, always best to think about the conservative measures first. And that's why our bimanual exam is so important. And that's a wrap. Did you like this video? If so, hit like and subscribe.

o3JY6D6qbtU,"I'm Dr. Andrew Elkwood. I'm a surgeon at the Institute for Advanced Reconstruction and I specialize in the microsurgery of nerves. Pedendal neuralgia is a compression of the pedendal nerve. So what that amounts to is the pedendal nerve is in someone's pelvis. It's the nerve that goes to their genitalia, to their perineum, to the anus, that whole entire area down there. And pedendal neuralgia is where that nerve gets entrapped. So it's very much like corpal tunnel is in the wrist. So in the wrist, corpal tunnel syndrome is where the median nerve, which is the nerve to the first three and a half fingers, goes through a leathery tunnel in the wrist. If for some reason that tunnel is tight, the nerve gets compressed and you can get symptoms. The symptoms can be numbness, pain, weakness of grip. It's analogous in the pelvis. The pedendal nerve goes through what's called Alcox canal, which is also a leathery tunnel in the pelvis, and it can give people perineal symptoms. And those symptoms can be pain, they can be numbness, they can be tingling in that area, even to the point of what we call kind of dysesthesia, where it's oversensitive. It can give people bowel symptoms, incontinence of urine, incontinence of stool, sexual dysfunction, what we call dysparia-unia or painful intercourse. Any of those things can occur with pedendal neuralgia. So first, when a patient contacts IFAR, they are put in touch with one of our IFAR specialists. Now these are trained individuals who know specifically what to ask for to form a preliminary diagnosis based off of what you were calling about. In the case of pedendal neuralgia, you'll have a series of questions that you'll receive, and then we will ask you for other documentation that goes over what other procedures and testing that you've had. From this initial screening, we'll determine if you're a candidate to continue the process in determining if you need to be worked up further for pedendal neuralgia. What we do surgically is we give the nerves more room if they're swollen. So if they're traveling through a tight leathery tunnel, we may French bread the top of the tunnel so that the nerve has room again and it doesn't get pinched. So we think of pelvic outlet compression syndromes kind of all as a spectrum. Pedendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, they're all kind of part of the same basic process. The pipes are clogged. Clogged at this elbow or that elbow or both a little bit. It all depends. So that's a full spectrum. People come to IFR because we're responsive and we really care. We're very invested in our patient outcomes, and I don't think there's a single surgeon that doesn't take it very personally if they have a patient that doesn't do well. And we're incredibly invested in getting them to the right person, even if it's not us. So there is no hesitancy within us to pick up the phone and say, you know what, you need my colleague and he's up the street. Let me get you in right away to see him. And then they don't have to wait to make other appointments or to go through that process. We can shortcut everything and get them to the right place. Regarding pudendal neuralgia, it's fairly rare. We see a lot of it because we see a big swath of the patient population that has this. That being said, it's probably also significantly underdiagnosed. And it's probably more prevalent than people think. But the most important thing is it's still one of the less common reasons for people having pelvic pain. They shouldn't jump to a conclusion that they have pudendal neuralgia just because they have pelvic pain. Patients first need to see at least their primary care physician to make sure there's not other issues. It is essentially obligate that a woman see a gynecologist before seeing us and men see a urologist before seeing us because those problems are much more common than the things that we see. Nonetheless if a patient has been screened through their primary and through the first level of specialties, if their etiology or the cause of their problem is still not clear or if things are starting to point to pelvic outlet syndrome, pudendal neuralgia and so on, we're happy to see them. And then usually our workup will start with a good history and physical and then work from there. Just call. Just call, take 15 minutes and talk with myself or Dr. Elquit or anyone else. That's it. If you have someone that can help you, hear it out, you can always say no. I like to say if a barber offers you a haircut, you don't have to get a cut. You can come back and you can always come back if you decide no. But just talk and see because the worst thing is to have a treatable condition, let time pass and now a treatable condition became an untreatable condition because too much time elapsed.

The objective of this short talk is presentation how to do pudendal nerve block and how to do trigger point injections and injections to the pelvic floor. After ensuring informed consent from patient, patient is positioned in dorsal atotomy position with legs and stirrups. Equipment required for pudendal nerve block is following. Sterile gloves, mucus, povidone iodine or stanchaxidine, 10 cc controlled syringe, Iova Trampet, 20 gauge 15 cm spinal needle, regular spinal needle for transpirinal approach, 1% local anesthetic. Prior to doing pudendal nerve block you would like to be sure that the spinal needle is appropriate length. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet. Tip of the spinal needle should be 1.5 to 2 cm longer than Iova Trampet. Prior to performing pudendal nerve block we need to identify ischial spine first. Two fingers are introduced in vagina and then on the lateral vaginal wall there is a prominent which is ischial spine and if you gently push on this it will cause discomfort with patient. Ischial spine is marked with a pink marker on the side wall. Local anesthetic and spinal needles are ready. Iova Trampet for patient right side is mounted on the right hand of the surgeon with the opening on the top and tip of Iova Trampet is between two fingers. After placing lots of mucus, fingers are gently placed into vagina. After we identify ischial spine, trumpet needle is introduced. Tip of the trumpet needle is pointed at the ischial spine, moved 1 cm immediately and inferiorly and pushed gently against vaginal mucosa. Spinal needle is introduced through Iova Trampet until resistance is met. For the teaching purposes this is how long is tip of the needle outside Iova Trampet. The needle is further introduced 1.5 to 2 cm into tissue around pudendal nerve with an aspirated syringe to confirm there is no intravascular placement and then solution is then injected. Following injection spinal needle is slowly withdrawn leaving Iova Trampet in place and then Iova Trampet is removed slowly. I just injected 10cc of ampersand xylocaine to patient's right side. Now we are going to switch the side. Iova Trampet is placed in surgeon's left hand. Iova Trampet is introduced in vagina. Left ischial spine is found.

uFWk7ztMfj8,"This video will explain what to expect when you are getting your nerve block. Your anesthesiologist is a doctor who specializes in the relief of pain and administering anesthesia to patients having surgery. A nerve block is a type of anesthesia where the anesthesiologist injects numbing medication around a nerve or nerve bundle which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body. The nerve block may also cause weakness in the same area. Right before your surgery, your anesthesiologist will discuss the nerve block with you and answer any questions you may have. The nerve block is usually done right before your surgery. It may be performed in a special area or in the operating room. Your team will place monitors to watch your vital signs and give you extra oxygen to breathe during the procedure. Before beginning your nerve block, your anesthesia doctor will go through a safety checklist to confirm the right procedure is being done on the right patient. Once you have been placed in the proper position, your anesthesia doctor will be ready to begin the nerve block. Placing the nerve block will usually take 5 to 15 minutes. It will take longer if your doctor is placing a nerve block catheter. As your doctor begins the procedure, they may give you a small amount of medicine through your IV to help you relax during the procedure. The medicine will not knock you out. It is important for you to be awake during the nerve block so that you can follow any instructions and let the doctor know if you are feeling any pain or discomfort during the process. The next step is for your doctor to clean the area where the block will be placed with an antibacterial soap. Most nerves are just a few inches beneath the skin. Your doctor may use a special machine that uses sound waves to identify the nerve. Once the nerve has been located, the actual nerve block can begin. Your doctor will place a small amount of numbing medicine at the skin. Once your doctor has located the nerve with the ultrasound machine, they will then place a small blunt needle right next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort, such as sharp or shooting pain. This will allow your doctor to adjust the location of the needle. Once the needle is properly positioned, the doctor will inject numbing medicine next to the nerve. Please let your doctor know if you are feeling any discomfort during the injection, ringing in your ears, a metal taste in your mouth, feeling dizzy, or anything else unusual. This may be due to problems with the injection. Once the nerve block is finished, many patients may feel the nerve block beginning to work after only a few minutes. It may take up to 45 minutes for the nerve block to reach its maximum effect. You may feel a numbness or tingling sensation, or even weakness in the muscles of the body part where the nerve block was placed as it begins to work. Certain surgeries may have strong pain for several days. Because a single injection of numbing medicine with a nerve block only lasts 8 to 24 hours after it is placed, you and your anesthesia doctor may decide that it would be best for you to have a nerve block catheter. A nerve block catheter is a very small tube, about the size of fishing line. It is placed through the needle so that it is next to your nerve. Numbing medicine may be given through the tubing for several days to make your nerve block last longer. Once the nerve block catheter is properly placed, the needle will be removed. Your doctor will use tape and other bandages to hold the catheter in place. They will inject the catheter with numbing medicine and ask you how you were feeling to help them detect any problems with the injection. After the first numbing medicine is injected, your doctor will hook up your catheter to a pump, which can drip a small amount of numbing medicine around the nerves for several days.",Pudendal Nerve,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 5

Parineum is the space between the anus and scrotum in male or between the anus and vulva in female. It is also safe and effective for urological procedures including transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, transurethral, prostatectomy, and catheter related bladder discomfort. Pudendal nerve is a mixed nerve both sensory and motor fibers mainly for the perineum and external genitalia in both sexes. It arises in the pelvic cavity from the sacral plexus S2 S4 leaves it through the greater sciatic foramen hooking around the ischial spine and enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen. Procedure local anesthetic such as lidocaine or chloroprocaine is injected into the pudendal canal where the pudendal nerve is located. Lidocaine is usually preferred for this because it has a longer duration than chloroprocaine. It aims to block the nerve as it enters the lesser sciatic foramen one centimeter inferior and medial relative to the attachment of the sacros spinous ligament to the ischial spine. Anatomical approaches transvaginal approach common for obstetric and gynecological procedures.

HCjtaJFgv6E,"Pudendal neuralgia and pudendal nerve block. Pudendal neuralgia is an important cause of chronic pelvic pain in both men and women and results from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve. Pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves in the pelvis and originates from the sacral nerve roots. In the gluteal region, it runs between ligaments and close to the sciatic nerve before entering the Alcox canal. Pudendal nerve entrapment results from compression of the nerve during its course through the ligaments or the Alcox canal. Symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment include pain in buttocks and genital areas, pain in the back passage and lower abdominal pain. Pain is typically aggravated by sitting and relieved by standing upright. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, rehabilitative approach including pelvic floor exercises and injections. Dr Krishna is highly experienced in performing pudendal nerve blocks. The injection is performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. Dr Krishna will initially numb the skin with a numbing medicine. He will then use an ultrasound machine to guide the needle accurately close to the pudendal nerve. Dr Krishna will eventually inject a mixture of local anaesthetic and steroid around the pudendal nerve. Pain relief from pudendal nerve injection can last several months, though this may not always be the case.

IpY79hQKlEk,"Good morning everybody, I am George Mjes from the St. Joseph University in Beirut, Lebanon. Today I am going to be presenting about laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release or pudendal entrapment syndrome. I have no conflict of interest. Pudendal nerves can be entrapped at different anatomical sites along with the pudendal artery. The two main entrapment locations remain between the sacrospinus and the sacrotuberous ligaments and the alcocanal. Pudendal nerve and artery entrapment is an underdiagnosed condition in clinical practice that causes mainly perineal pain and sexual dysfunction, but also urinary and rectal symptoms. Historically, and after failure of the conservative management, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes and this is why the non-criteria which were put to standardize the diagnosis were very selective in order to minimize overtreatment by such an invasive approach. This was until the advent of laparoscopic pudendal release which allowed a minimally invasive surgery with an easy access and gentle blood-free dissection. This has therefore led to widening of surgical indications. The aim of our study was to assess the safety, feasibility and functional outcomes of laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome with both a short and long-term follow-up. 235 patients with pudendal nerve entrapment were included in the study and they underwent laparoscopic transparitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release. Post-operative complications, according to the Clavian-Dendou classification, were recorded both on a short and long-term follow-up. Those are briefly the surgery steps. First, we developed the octorator space and we carried the dissection medially to the octorator vein. The coccygeous muscle fibers must be cut and released to have access to the ischial spine on which the surgeon's forceps pointing in Figure C. Finally, we arrived to the entry to the alcocanal. Here, we can clearly see the pudendal vein and artery entering the alcocanal. The pudendal nerve is lateral to the artery and not visible in the image. The goal of the surgery is to liberate the pudendal elements from the ischiatic spine to the alcocanal and transpose them medially. After assessing the post-operative outcomes in the total cohort, a prospective cohort of 32 patients was evaluated for functional outcomes before and at least 24 months after surgery. The main outcomes that were assessed are pernioidemia using visual analog scale, urinary symptoms using the urinary symptom profile, erectile function using the IIEF5, and bowel function using the patient assessment of constipation symptoms PAC-SYM score. The mean operative time per side was 33 minutes and the hospital length of stay was 2 days for the majority of patients. No significant blood loss and no serious clavian-dindo 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. Prenile or perineal paresthesia or hyperaesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint. However, it was transitory for 3 months after which all patients were free of symptoms. As for functional outcomes, perineal pain decreased significantly from a mean of VAS of 7 to a mean of 2. Erectile function improved significantly after surgery and we think it is most probably due to the artery entrapment since immediate results were seen after surgery. Constipation also decreased significantly after surgery. As for the urinary symptoms, improvement was only noted for the dysuria domain. No significant differences were found between before and after surgery or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms. So to conclude, laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release is both a fast and safe surgery with promising functional outcomes on pudendal neuralgia, erectile function, lower urinary tract symptoms and constipation. Thank you for your attention!",Pudendal Nerve,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0," 5

Additionally, it does not provide context on the prevalence or significance of this condition in the broader context of pelvic pain or sexual dysfunction disorders.

Therefore, while the information is highly relevant for understanding the surgical procedure itself, it only partially addresses the potential range of questions readers might have about pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome and its management."," 3

The video transcript mentions some sources of evidence, but not in a comprehensive manner. The speaker cites the Clavien-Dindo classification for reporting post-operative complications, and mentions using specific assessment tools like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) score. However, no specific references are provided for the background information on pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome, its diagnosis, or the historical context of open surgical approaches. The functional outcomes and surgical details are likely based on the presenter's own study or experience, but no explicit citation is given. Overall, while some assessment tools and classifications are referenced, the main claims and background information lack clear attribution to specific sources or studies."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides some dates or time references related to the information presented, but not for all the sources acknowledged. The date of the presentation or video itself is not explicitly mentioned. However, it mentions that laparoscopic pudendal nerve release is a more recent development compared to the historical open invasive approach, which implies that the information and techniques discussed are relatively current. It also mentions a prospective cohort study of 32 patients evaluated for functional outcomes ""at least 24 months after surgery,"" indicating that the study data is fairly recent. However, no specific dates or time frames are provided for the other sources or studies referenced in the presentation."," 4

Explanation: The video transcript presents information from a research study conducted by the speaker, which suggests an objective point of view.

However, no suggestions for further reading or details of other organizations providing advice and information on this topic are mentioned in the transcript."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially refers to areas of uncertainty regarding treatment choices for pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. While the speaker discusses the historical approach of open invasive pudendal nerve decompression and its poor outcomes, leading to the development of laparoscopic pudendal release, there is no explicit mention of uncertainty or differences in expert opinion concerning the current treatment choices. The speaker presents the laparoscopic approach as a promising treatment option, but does not delve into any potential uncertainties or gaps in knowledge surrounding its use or compare it to other available treatments. The discussion focuses primarily on the surgical technique and outcomes, without addressing potential areas of uncertainty or debate within the medical community."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript provides a partial description of how the laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release treatment works. It explains the surgical steps involved in the procedure, such as developing the obturator space, cutting the coccygeus muscle fibers, and liberating the pudendal elements from the ischial spine to the alcocanalal. However, it does not explicitly describe the mechanisms by which this surgical intervention alleviates the symptoms of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome, such as how it relieves nerve compression or improves blood flow. The transcript focuses more on the technical aspects of the procedure and the observed functional outcomes, rather than the underlying physiological mechanisms."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the benefits of the laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release treatment for pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. It mentions that the surgery led to a significant decrease in perineal pain, improvement in erectile function (likely due to releasing the entrapped artery), and reduction in constipation symptoms. However, it does not clearly describe the benefits for other symptoms like stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. The benefits of any alternative treatments or conservative management are also not discussed."," 3

Explanation: The video transcript partially describes the risks or potential complications associated with the laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release procedure. It mentions that no significant blood loss and no serious Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and 4 post-operative complications were noted. It also states that perineal paresthesia or hyperesthesia was the most frequent post-operative complaint, although it was transitory and resolved within 3 months. However, the transcript does not provide a comprehensive list of potential risks, side effects, or long-term complications associated with the procedure. It focuses primarily on the positive outcomes and functional improvements observed in the study cohort."," 1

Explanation: The transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits of not receiving treatment (watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment) for pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. The focus of the presentation is on describing the laparoscopic surgical technique for treating the condition and the outcomes observed after the surgery. There is no mention of what could happen if the condition is left untreated or if treatment is postponed or avoided."," 3

Explanation: The transcript partially discusses the effects of the laparoscopic pudendal nerve and artery release treatment on overall quality of life. It mentions improvements in specific areas such as perineal pain, erectile function, and constipation after the surgery. However, it does not provide a clear and comprehensive assessment of how the treatment affects overall day-to-day activities or general quality of life. The focus is primarily on the technical aspects of the surgery and specific symptom improvements, without explicitly addressing the broader impact on quality of life."," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. While it primarily focuses on describing the laparoscopic transperitoneal pudendal nerve and artery release surgery, it mentions that historically, open invasive pudendal nerve decompression was done with poor outcomes, suggesting that this was an alternative treatment approach. However, the video does not provide clear details about who might benefit more from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one choice might be preferred over the other. The information about alternative treatment options remains incomplete."," 2

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is limited. While the presenter discusses the surgical procedure and its potential benefits, there is no explicit mention of involving patients, family members, or other healthcare professionals in the decision-making process regarding treatment choices. The focus is primarily on presenting the technical aspects of the procedure and the outcomes observed in the study. However, the discussion of functional outcomes, such as improvements in perineal pain, erectile function, and constipation, could be seen as information that patients may want to consider when evaluating treatment options in consultation with their healthcare providers. Overall, the transcript lacks direct encouragement for shared decision-making, but it provides some relevant information that could contribute to informed decision-making if discussed with healthcare professionals.",set()
JRTcY3bN6c8,"I’m Dr. Andrew Elkwood, I am a plastic and reconstructive surgeon I specialize in in microsurgery of nerves and particularly in nerves of the pelvis so syndromes like a pudendal neuralgia, pelvic nerve entrapment and piriformis syndrome. Unfortunately not too many people either in the medical community or public at large really have a full grasp of pudendal neuralgia, it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed undertreated. In edition it's a huge psychological stress for patients and sometimes in and of itself if it causes psychological issues. For the cause of pudendal neuralgia there are many from anything that is what we called idiopathic meaning you don't know why it happens. It can be certainly from childbirth, exercise trend towards riding- bike riding is terrific but racing bicycle seats can really be a problem if some of those see if they're not fitted properly, put all of the weight on the pudendal nerve and that's a terrible thing. Chronic constipation can be a problem any reason for straining whether be lifting or otherwise anything that would cause the veins in your forehead or in your neck to pop up cause can cause the veins in the pelvis to pop up and if those in large veins put pressure on a nerve, you can end up with pudendal neuralgia. Those are the typical causes. Post-radiation for cancer treatment can also be a cause. I would say post patients though are idiopathic in that we don't know what causes it but it's very much akin to a carpal tunnel in your wrist for carpal tunnel is compression of the median nerve which is the nerve that goes to the 3 and 1/2 thumb sided fingers and that nerve goes through a tight tunnel and if the nerves swell for whatever reasons than nerve gets pinched and you get into nerve problems. Alcott's canal in the pelvis is analogous to that it's a tight tunnel where the nerves in the column go through so the pathophysiology or how the disease develops is something that's well understood and the surgery is really aimed at that particular anatomy in the right patient population the surgery can be incredibly effective.",Pudendal Nerve,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0," 3

48kkAh_J6nE,"It's a condition you don't hear about, but it's one that makes it impossible for some people to sit without severe pain. Our Dr. Karen Johnson tells us more in today's Focus on Health. After years of trying, Celeste Lip and her husband were ecstatic to finally have a baby girl. She's our miracle baby. As Celeste recovered from the pains of birth, she still experienced excruciating pain whenever she was sitting. She was frustrated by what was causing it. Usually with childbirth, it's actually the nerve being stretched between two ligaments, very broad, heavy ligaments. In cyclists, it's the same thing. Cyclists are very athletic, and the ligaments actually become enlarged, and the nerve becomes entrapped. Celeste finally learned she had pudendal nerve entrapment. This nerve sits between two ligaments just below the sacrum and provides control and sensation to the bladder, genitalia, and rectum. At first it started out just feeling like there was a knife blade caught inside, and now it just feels like the skin is, in addition, the skin is abraded. It feels like it should be bleeding. Celeste tried injections into the nerve to block the pain, but they weren't successful, so she decided to have a surgical procedure to correct it. We cut the ligaments, and we open up this little channel that it runs in deep in the pelvis and free the nerve up and then actually shift it into a new location where it's not under any tension at all. So if you're experiencing severe pain when sitting, you've seen many doctors and still aren't sure what's going on, you may have pudendal nerve entrapment. So discuss this option with your doctor. With today's focus on health, I'm Dr. Karen Johnson. Well, try to imagine this, living with pain so severe that you go from doctor to doctor and no one can help you. And imagine not being able to sit. It's no laughing matter. Medical reporter Kristi Meyer is here with a new treatment that's going to give some relief. The problem too with diagnosis are the pain is so severe most people can't sit, but it's embarrassing then when they go to the doctor, it's usually misdiagnosed. Gina Keisler was an avid cyclist until she took a rough fall off her bike. She landed on her bottom, causing an injury that began a decade of pain. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. Gina who lives in Indianapolis went to some 40 medical specialists before coming to Houston for a new surgery. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. Dr. Kenneth Rainey knows how bad her pain is. He had it too after being hit by a car as he rode his bicycle. The worst problem is that you can't sit and socially you're really restricted in what you can do. Your life resolves around sitting in the chair in the recliner so that you don't have pain. The injury causes the pudendal nerve which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs to be squeezed by ligaments. Rainey saw a dozen doctors before going to France for surgery. He then took a Houston team back for training. Went over and we spent two weeks there and we learned the French technique so that I could bring them back, French trained so that we can offer this to American patients. And it's not just cyclists that can have this kind of pain. It can happen to people who wrestle. It can happen after a fall if you're rollerblading or ice skating. And it can even occur after childbirth or after gynecological surgery. Gina came from Indianapolis for surgery. When they released the pressure on the nerve, she has a 60% chance of being cured. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. We hope this is the end in sight. After today's surgery, Gina may have immediate relief or it could take up to two years. For more information on pudendal pain, we've linked our website to Memorial Hermann's. The hospital's PNE team has treated 115 patients in less than two years. Almost all were misdiagnosed by other doctors. With today's health check, I'm Kristi Myers. From Houston's News Leader, this is 13 Eyewitness News, Live at 5. I'm Kristi Myers. Imagine not being able to sit because of the pain. How one young woman who was suicidal had her life turned around. That story coming up later on Live at 5. She suffered from unspeakable pain that prevented her from even sitting down. It would take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations. This is a saving place. 13's Kristi Myers with how she got the pain to stop. Well, a couple of weeks ago we told you about a young woman who had so much pain that she couldn't even sit down. In fact, she became suicidal. What happened was a bicycle fall first caused that pain, but after a decade she became desperate. So this is the story of how her life was changed. This was Gina Kiesler two weeks ago, in so much pain she couldn't sit down. To go through it on an hourly basis with no end in sight is just a living hell. The pain began when this long distance bicycle rider fell off and landed on her seat. It's unbearable, it's intractable, it's unspeakable. I call it a modern torture. She saw more than 40 medical specialists in Indiana before coming to Houston for a new surgery she prayed would help. To take a person who is confident, who has every reason to live their life, to have suicidal ideations, this is a saving grace. It's a terribly disabling syndrome. People have a horrible burning pain in their bottom. The pudendal nerve, which goes to the rectum, bladder and reproductive organs, can get trapped or squeezed between ligaments. And we cut those ligaments, releasing the nerve. And then once we've done that, it takes time in most people for the nerve to recover. Surgeons at Memorial Hermann Southwest had to go to France to learn the surgery. I can have my vitality back, my personality, my energy, my zest for life. And this was Gina only three days after surgery. I really don't feel any of the deep aching or the burning sensations that I would have deep in my buttock area. And that's just really exciting.

The risks are only covered for the main surgical treatment discussed, but not comprehensively for all treatments mentioned."," 5

The transcript provides a clear description of the risks and benefits associated with not pursuing treatment (i.e., watchful waiting or permanently forgoing treatment) for pudendal nerve entrapment.

The risks of not treating the condition are highlighted through the testimonies of patients who suffered from severe, debilitating pain that prevented them from sitting comfortably, affected their quality of life, and even led to suicidal ideation. Phrases like ""living hell,"" ""modern torture,"" and ""unbearable, intractable, unspeakable"" pain emphasize the severe consequences of leaving the condition untreated.

On the other hand, the transcript also highlights the potential benefits of undergoing the surgical treatment, with patients reporting immediate relief from pain and the prospect of regaining their vitality, personality, energy, and zest for life after the surgery.

Overall, the transcript provides a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with not treating puden"," 4

Explanation: The video transcript provides some information about how the treatment choice of surgery to release the entrapped pudendal nerve can potentially improve the patient's quality of life by relieving severe pain that prevented them from sitting or participating in normal daily activities. However, the details on the specific impacts on quality of life after the surgery are somewhat limited. The transcript mentions that patients may experience immediate relief or it could take up to two years for the nerve to recover after surgery. It also highlights one patient's hope to regain ""vitality, personality, energy, and zest for life"" after the surgery. While this touches on quality of life, a more comprehensive description of how the treatment impacts day-to-day functioning, activities, and overall wellbeing could have been provided to fully address the question. Therefore, a score of 4 (Partially) is appropriate as the information is present but not fully fleshed out."," 4

The video transcript partially makes it clear that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for pudendal nerve entrapment. It mentions two treatment options: injections into the nerve to block pain, and surgery to release the entrapped nerve by cutting the ligaments. However, the transcript does not provide a detailed description of who is most likely to benefit from each treatment choice or under what specific circumstances one option may be preferred over the other. The focus is primarily on the surgical procedure, with limited information given about the alternative injection treatment. While the existence of multiple treatment choices is acknowledged, the video does not thoroughly explore the factors that would guide the selection of one option over the other."," 4

The video transcript provides some support for shared decision-making, suggesting that patients discuss the option of surgery for pudendal nerve entrapment with their doctors. However, it does not explicitly encourage patients to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, or other health professionals beyond doctors. The transcript focuses mainly on explaining the condition, its causes, and the surgical treatment option. While it highlights the importance of consulting doctors for a proper diagnosis and treatment, it does not comprehensively promote shared decision-making involving a broader support network.

Gynecological issues involving the uterus and cervix as well as urological issues involving the prostate can all present similarly to Pedendal Neuralgia. There are also musculoskeletal problems involving the hips and hernias which can also mimic Pedendal Neuralgia. The human body has difficulty differentiating pain especially within the pelvis which is why we order imaging to help make our diagnosis. A typical workup includes an MRI of the lumbar spine throughout any spinal abnormalities as well as an MR neurography to help visualize the Pedendal nerve, the pelvis, and the hips. We also order a CT guided Pedendal nerve injection to help provide the patients with pain relief as well as to help make our diagnosis. All patients require pre-operative testing. Each patient needs to have lab work completed. It is up to the surgeon's discretion whether the patient requires a medical clearance. For example, if a patient has cardiac medical problems then they'll need a cardiac clearance prior to surgery. The nurses will provide the patients with scripts for lab work and EKGs as well as clearance forms. The patients will then be able to take those scripts and clearance forms to their primary care provider or any other physician they need to take them to to have it completed.

vj-_D9q4Krw,"In this video, we would like to present alloparoscopic pudendal neuralysis for the pudendal neuralgia treatment. The case is a 54 year old female. The background was two vaginal deliveries, two episodes of trauma over the coxis and repetition cystitis. For the last four years, she complains about dyspareunia and pain in the left vaginal and perianal region. The pain is worse with defecation and urination. The pain is very intense, 9 in the visual analogical scale and gets worse throughout the day and when sitting up. It's a pain in bed and allowing to sleep normally. Clinical findings, sensibility, research, intense pain when pressing the left ischial spine, pelvic MNR without pathological findings. See the guided pudendal block, positive diagnostic response. Based on Nantes criteria, the patient was diagnosed of left pudendal neuralgia and trait in the pain unit by neuromodulator drugs and radiofrequency following our protocol. The outcome was unsatisfactory, so the surgery was decided. The surgeon is placed in the side opposite to the nerve to be released. We usually use four truckers, three of five and one of ten millimeters. We are located in the left side of the pelvis and our first objective is locating both, the umbilical artery that is going to be our medial limit and the iliac vein that will be our lateral limit. Once the umbilical artery is located, the peritoneum between the vein and the artery is cut as mentioned and we access to the obturator fossa. We move forward in our dissection downwards and towards. Here we meet up again with the umbilical artery that as we are saying it's our medial limit. We keep moving forward and the next structure that we are going to find is the obturator nerve that is going to serve as well as lateral limit. Right below the obturator nerve, the obturator vein appears. This vein is surrounded by the fat tissue that we should medially reject in order to make progress in our dissection. It's convenient to create an adequate field of vision because as you can see this area is fully occupied by relevant vascular structures with a high risk of bleeding. That way having an adequate field will make easier in case we have any incident during the surgery. We keep moving forward and here we are getting rid of more adipose tissue and we come up with a muscular structure named myotendinous arc. This structure is important because right below it we locate the sciatic spine that is a key anatomic point in this surgery because the sacral spinal ligament is inserted in it. In this moment we are cutting the coccygeus muscle that is a thin and wide muscular structure that covers the sacral spinal ligament. It's convenient to use some sort of energy system. In this case we are using bipolar energy because this is a structure that bleeds with relative ease. Once we finish cutting the coccygeus muscle the sacral spinal ligament is exposed. This is a strong fairly wide structure that we will cut as close as possible to the sciatic spine. When we start cutting the sacral spinal ligament the pudendal neurovascular complex structures appears. Here we can see both the pudendal vein and artery. We keep cutting the ligament until reach a fatty tissue that will indicate the end of our section and the beginning of the alkyl scanal. Here we can see the fat tissue. Right in this moment the pudendal nerve is left uncovered and completely released. Once the nerve is released we just have to check the mustaches and we conclude our procedure by routinely instilling a mixture of corticoid and local anesthetic. We don't put any drainage and of course we close the peritoneal defect. The follow-up of the office was at one, three and six months and the visual anologic scale was two, nine preoperative.

While it encourages consulting a doctor, it does not explicitly promote shared decision-making or discussing treatment choices with others.",set()
v_svimhWU9c,"Hey, we're back with another episode of ""10 patients in 10 minutes."" And this one episode one: pelvic floor pain, and could also be a case of pudendal pain. And those can be used interchangeably, and sometimes they cannot. We're gonna specifically call out one case in this series that was in fact a pudendal nerve pain and we know that for sure. So we are going to look at these three cases, starting with the youngest gentlemen...all these will be males. Pelvic floor pain, I don't remember what specific side, but it also included some genitourinary symptoms...such as problems with an erection. I'm gonna go ahead and draw in some of the changes so you can see the shift that's here in the body. This is the lower pelvic area, this is splitting the middle of the pelvis and you can see how on the image on the left the upper body masss leans over towards the right. We've got less lean in the upper body mass in the post correction image. Less lean of the head and the neck back to the left, like we do here. And it's kind of hard to visualize because of the plane that we're looking at it, but if you look at the shoulder you're going to see that this image has a little bit more forward rotation here. So this is how he unwinds after his first correction. He comes for a couple visits and has about 50% reduction in the pelvic floor pain. This is the second case, a male, quite a bit older he has overlying symptoms and this is often what we see with the pelvic floor pain, involving the bladder and the pelvic floor. As it turns out the bladder issues would need to be resolved surgically, but the pelvic floor problem would still remain. They thought that perhaps that pelvic floor would calm down after the bladder surgery but it did not. So what we're gonna do here is we're going to point out the shift that was possible in his pelvis. See this here...that here that's the center of the pelvis. You can see the elevation on this right hip and just kind of how that hip and pelvis was rotated. You can see the way that his body mass goes over away from the high hip over towards the left side, and the way that his head and his neck counter balance back towards the right. The post correction image clearly shows that he's more on the vertical axis. He's standing taller. There's less hip issues. The pelvic floor problem would resolve both by unlocking the neck in the protocol that I use to do that, as well as specifically adjusting and releasing L3. The L3 vertebra in this case was very much rotated and that needed to be unlocked in order for complete resolution of the pelvic floor pain. Moving on to the third and final case which has been featured in other articles on my website because it's a very satisfying case in the sense that the patient's symptoms are around for quite some time...And this was a true pudendal neuralgia in the sense that the symptoms went from the base or the pelvic floor all the way out via the genitals and had some associated symptoms with that. I won't get into too many details on that. But here you see the shift and the upright body structure and the pelvis after the first release, specifically in this case, just cervical spine only. Again the center of the pelvic mass. Again you see a lean of a way of the body from the side of the high hip. The high hip was actually over here that's not well indicated by this line. There's forward rotation of the body towards this side. You can kind of visualize that that rotation comes out, and you can see how the both the head of the neck come back to a vertical after that release. And I was quite happy with how this gentleman shifted. And there is...over some time...it took a little while. And in general a complete resolution of the pudendal nerve pain, and then the symptoms associated with the pelvic floor which could also include some posterior hip pain, they are mostly gone. On occasion there is a flare-up. Okay so that was the final installment of ""10 patients in 10 minutes.""

Explanation: The video partially outlines its aims, which seem to be discussing cases of pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia, and how chiropractic adjustments can help alleviate these conditions. However, the aims are not explicitly stated upfront, and instead emerge gradually as the video progresses through the case studies. A clearer introduction laying out the specific goals of the video would have made the aims more apparent from the outset."," 3

Explanation:
The video provides some useful information about pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia, including case studies of three male patients who underwent chiropractic treatment for these conditions. It discusses the symptoms, potential causes, and the changes observed in the patients' posture and body alignment before and after treatment. However, the video does not explicitly outline its aims or provide a comprehensive overview of the conditions, their diagnosis, or treatment options beyond chiropractic care. While informative to some extent, it falls short of fully achieving its implied aim of educating viewers about pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia."," 3

The video transcript provides some relevant information about pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia, including case studies of three male patients who received chiropractic treatment for these conditions. The chiropractor explains the anatomical shifts and adjustments made to the spine and pelvis, and reports improvements in the patients' symptoms.

However, the information is quite technical and specific to chiropractic treatment, which may not fully address the broader questions readers might have about pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia, such as causes, symptoms, other treatment options, and prevention strategies. While the video is relevant for understanding chiropractic approaches to these conditions, it lacks comprehensive coverage of the topic from a medical perspective."," 3

Explanation: The video provides some references to the sources of information used, but it is not entirely clear or comprehensive. The presenter mentions that one case was a ""true pudendal neuralgia"" and provides details about the patient's symptoms and treatment, suggesting that this case was based on a specific patient experience. However, for the other cases discussed, it is not explicitly stated whether they are also based on real patient cases or if any research studies or expert opinions were consulted. The video relies heavily on the presenter's own expertise and observations, with limited direct references to external sources. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, as the sources of evidence are partially clear but not fully transparent."," 2

Explanation: The transcript provides some details about the cases discussed, but there are no clear dates mentioned for the sources of information used to compile the video. The only date-related information given is that the video itself is a recent upload, as evidenced by the YouTuber mentioning ""we're back with another episode."" However, there are no specific dates provided for when the cases were treated, when the research or information was gathered, or when any referenced studies or sources were published. Therefore, the score of 2 is appropriate, as only the date of the video itself is clear, but there are no dates given for the acknowledged sources or the information used to create the content."," 3

Explanation (215 words):
The video presents information from a personal point of view, focusing on the chiropractor's treatment approach for pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia. While it provides detailed case studies and explanations of the treatment methodology, it lacks a balanced discussion of alternative treatment options or references to other research studies or experts in the field.

The video is primarily centered on the advantages of the chiropractor's specific technique, without acknowledging potential limitations or considering other treatment modalities. It does not provide a comprehensive overview of the various causes, diagnostic methods, or treatment options for pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia.

While the case studies and visual aids are informative, the lack of external references or acknowledgment of other approaches creates a sense of bias towards the chiropractor's particular method. A more balanced perspective would involve discussing the potential roles of other treatment options, such as medication, physical therapy"," 2

Explanation: The video provides some information about the doctor's website (LIAChiro.com) and contact details (office phone number and Facebook page) for seeking further information or consultation. However, it does not provide details of any additional external sources or organizations that could offer support or information related to pelvic floor pain or pudendal neuralgia. The additional sources mentioned are limited to the doctor's own practice and social media channels. Therefore, I would give a score of 2, indicating that the video partially provides details of additional sources, but these are limited to local branches of the same organization (the doctor's practice)."," 1

The video transcript does not mention any uncertainty or gaps in knowledge regarding treatment choices for pelvic floor pain or pudendal neuralgia. The chiropractor discusses three cases of male patients with these conditions and describes the postural corrections and adjustments made, as well as the improvements in symptoms observed. However, there is no discussion of differences in expert opinion or areas of uncertainty concerning the treatment approach or choices. The chiropractor presents the treatment protocol used in these cases as effective, without acknowledging potential limitations or alternative treatment options."," 2

Explanation: The video provides some details on how the treatments work, but the explanations are incomplete or unclear in several instances. The chiropractor describes adjustments made to the spine, pelvis, and hips, and mentions releasing tension in specific areas like L3 vertebra and the cervical spine. However, there is little explanation of how exactly these adjustments alleviate pelvic floor pain or pudendal neuralgia. The mechanisms by which the treatments act on the body to achieve their effects are not clearly described. The focus is more on the physical adjustments made rather than the physiological processes involved. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate as the video only partially describes how the treatments work."," 3

Explanation: The video partially describes the benefits of the treatments for pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia. It mentions that the first patient had a 50% reduction in pelvic floor pain after the treatment. For the second patient, it states that the pelvic floor problem resolved along with unlocking the neck and adjusting the L3 vertebra. The third case of pudendal neuralgia had complete resolution of symptoms over time after the treatment. However, the video does not explicitly describe the benefits or outcomes for all the cases presented. It provides some details on symptom improvement but lacks a clear description of benefits for each treatment."," 2

Explanation: The transcript partially describes the risks or side effects associated with the treatments discussed. While it does not explicitly mention risks or side effects, it indirectly suggests that some patients experienced flare-ups or incomplete resolution of symptoms even after treatment. For example, it mentions that one patient had a ""50% reduction in pelvic floor pain"" after a couple of visits, implying that the pain was not fully resolved. Similarly, it notes that another patient experienced occasional flare-ups of pudendal nerve pain, even though the symptoms were mostly gone. However, no specific risks or side effects are described for the treatments themselves. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate, as risks are partially described for some but not all of the treatments mentioned."," 1

Explanation: The video transcript does not include any reference to the risks or benefits associated with not receiving treatment for pelvic floor pain or pudendal neuralgia. The video focuses on describing three patient cases and the chiropractic treatment approach used by the chiropractor. There is no mention of what would happen if these conditions were left untreated or if treatment was postponed or permanently forgone. The video solely discusses the treatment approach and outcomes for the three cases presented."," 3

Explanation (209 words):
The video partially describes how the treatment choices affect overall quality of life in relation to day-to-day activity. While it does not explicitly discuss the impact on overall quality of life, it provides some insights into how the treatment approach may alleviate symptoms and improve certain aspects of daily living.

For the first case, the video mentions a 50% reduction in pelvic floor pain after the treatment, which could potentially improve the patient's daily activities and comfort level. In the second case, the video notes that resolving the pelvic floor problem through the treatment approach could help, even though the bladder issues required separate surgery. For the third case, the video indicates a complete resolution of pudendal nerve pain and associated pelvic floor symptoms, along with occasional flare-ups, suggesting an improvement in daily functioning.

However, the video lacks specific details on how the treatment directly impacts overall quality of life,"," 2

Explanation: The video partially indicates that there may be more than one possible treatment choice for pelvic floor pain and pudendal neuralgia. It discusses chiropractic adjustments and releases as a treatment option for these conditions. However, it does not explicitly mention or compare alternative treatment choices, such as medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. The video focuses solely on the chiropractic approach and does not provide a comprehensive overview of potential treatment options or who might benefit most from each choice. While it suggests that chiropractic treatment can be effective, it does not clearly present it as one of multiple possible treatment choices to consider."," 2

The video provides some support for shared decision-making, but it is relatively limited. The transcript focuses primarily on describing three cases of pelvic floor pain and the chiropractic treatment approach used by the practitioner. There are no explicit suggestions for patients to discuss treatment choices with family, friends, doctors, or other health professionals. However, the practitioner does mention that one case required surgical intervention for a bladder issue, implying that consultation with other medical professionals may be necessary in some cases. Additionally, the invitation to contact the practitioner's office or social media channels for further questions could potentially lead to discussions about treatment options. Overall, while the video does not directly encourage shared decision-making, it leaves some room for patients to seek additional information and engage in discussions about their care.",set()
f72f8mRvA5Q,"I've had Crohn's since I was 21 years old and it was very aggressive. Riding in a car was hard and painful, let alone airplane flights and all of that. Just anything where you sit up in a chair, which is everything. Watching games, you know, riding a bike, riding a horse, doing anything. She came to us feeling very hopeless and feeling like she was at the end of her rope. There's a small yellow structure right down in there and that's called the pudendal nerve. It runs right under this ligament and then turns the corner and ends up running right in here. Okay? And that was the source for pain. And I'm sitting here and I'm not in pain from sitting here, which is nothing short of a miracle to me. So I'm grateful and thankful for anyone out there that needs to have something done that Dr. Agala can help them with. She definitely needs to do it. We were able to give her temporary relief, at least for a few hours of the pain. She said she hadn't been pain-free like that in years and we were very excited to help her with that. Thankfully, this will help us figure out exactly what to do. The pudendal nerve is a nerve that I operate on. I do it fairly routinely. More than anything, while we're excited to be able to make a diagnosis, what I'm most excited about is being able to offer Darcy something she hasn't had in a really long time. And that's hope. But don't wait. Get it done. He's very good. He's very gentle. He tells you everything he's going to do. He takes the time with you. A lot of doctors don't give you. And that is priceless in a doctor.

FjF4euhFWY8,"Welcome. I want to help you with your pain, your neuropathy, wherever you're having your problem right now within your body. I want to educate you so you understand what is happening so you can be proactive. Neuropathy can come from many factors, from diabetic neuropathy, too much sugar in the blood, which can cause irritation and damage to the nerves, injuries, herniated discs, autoimmune problems, as well as many others. But you're going to learn a lot of great information, so make sure you listen to the end. Peripheral neuropathy means any type of nerve involvement that's stemming outside of the brain and spinal cord. But they generally fall into three categories. The motor nerves, which control the movement of all the muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or even talking. The sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or the pain from a cut. And the autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people have no control over such as breathing, digesting food, our heart, or even our gland functions. Now our nervous system is quite complex, but for simplistic purposes, let's make this fun and educational. I want you to think of a safety pin. We all know what a safety pin looks like. Up on one side on the right, goes up on the left side, makes its way all the way back. Kind of like a loop. That's the way our body works. Imagine you touching something that was sharp or something that was hot. Well, you have sensory nerves, which we call afferent nerves on the outside of our body, particularly in our hands and our feet. And if I burn myself before this hand is going to move, this has to make its way up the arm, make its way back up to the brain. And once it gets in the brain, the brain then sends out efferent or motor nerves down the spine out back to the hand, because that will contract the muscle to pull it away. To save our hand from becoming burned or hurt. So when these nerves become inflamed or irritated from neuropathy, we have a covering over those nerves. And we call that the myelin sheath. And that myelin is an insulating layer or sheath that forms around those nerves, which is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along those nerve cells. But if that myelin becomes damaged, those electrical impulses start to slow down, meaning it's not making its way to where it needs to go fast enough, and therefore those are the symptoms that you're going to experience. The tingling, the numbness, the cramping, the burning, the pain, regardless of the symptoms, what do we do? We need to rejuvenate that myelin. We need to get those nerve cells working at its maximum potential. So if you're having nerve compression anywhere else in your body, in your neck, your back, your shoulder, your legs, your hips, the bottom line is those nerves are going to get inflamed. They're not going to function correctly because those nerves cannot send those electrical impulses fast enough to the parts of the body they're trying to get to. So I want to introduce you to a vitamin like chemical that we call alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods, particularly in red meats, organ meats like liver, heart, kidney, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, green peas, and rice bran. Realize that alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell in our body. This is where it helps turn glucose into energy. And this strong antioxidant is what attacks those free radicals, those waste products that are created when the body turns food into energy. And alpha lipoic acid is known to be one of the greatest anti-inflammatories when it comes to helping nerves, helping diabetic neuropathies, as well as many other neuropathies. This helps preserve, helps strengthen, and helps heal that myelin sheath. So if the nerve damages in your legs, you can see the nerve cell before and after, particularly that myelin sheath as it degenerates. And here you can see the phases of that nerve degeneration, how that myelin sheath starts to waste away. So if that tingling or pain or radiation that you're getting is coming from your hands or your feet, remember, those are the same nerves within our body. They are inflamed and irritated, and we need to put them to the rescue so they can heal once again. Alpha lipoic acid is known to also help neurodegenerative diseases. It will also help reduce aging skin. Alpha lipoic acid helps the protective effects to the pancreatic islet cells and therefore improves the blood glucose levels. And this potentially can reduce the complications of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, as well as nerve damage. This will help reduce the risk of that excess plaquing within the arteries. Unfortunately, as we age, our body produces less alpha lipoic acid. So therefore, if we're not getting enough from our foods and we have neurological involvement, where we have that peripheral neuropathy, it's always best to supplement. And studies show that anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams a day is most beneficial. What's nice about the alpha lipoic acid supplement is that it's water and fat soluble. So that means you can take it on an empty stomach or with food, if it's fat or any food, because it's going to assimilate regardless. Although many studies show that it's best to take it on an empty stomach. There are other important nutrients that will be an asset to you, like the B vitamins, vitamin D, your omega threes, as well as your fruits and vegetables, those colorful fruits, your green veggies, you're going to get lots of nutrients from those. Taking 600 milligrams daily within three weeks, many of you may see a significant reduction of your symptoms. So here's the bottom line. Alpha lipoic acid to me is the number one nutrient you can take for neuropathy. There's nothing that can compare. Yes, having a clean diet, exercise, drinking lots of water, getting your sleep is all going to help you. But alpha lipoic acid is amazing for metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, type one diabetes, or any type of insulin resistance. This can help repair those nerves so those messages can be sent back to the brain and from the brain back to that part of the body. So your nervous system can start to repair and heal so you can be pain free and happy once again. And there are many studies that show that alpha lipoic acid can do wonders for your nervous system. So you might want to give it a try. Please share this video with your friends and family. Leave your comments below because there will be many. And most important, make it a great day.

ypjJ9yQ-5wI,"My previous background as a pelvic surgeon has made me acutely aware of the significant disability that can occur with pudendal neuralgia. Many patients that I've treated in the past have found limited benefit or relief from surgery or from traditional therapy such as injections of steroids. Pudendal neuralgia is caused by many different things, but commonly we see chronic inflammation and impairment in the nerve function. Stem cell therapy is unique in that it not only provides the ability for the body to restore or to block the inflammatory response, but it can actually permanently restore normal blood vessels, providing oxygen to that nerve, which is essential for the repair process. Even in situations where the nerve becomes entrapped by tissue, it's typically an inflammatory response, and the stem cells are incredible at breaking down that inflammatory tissue and helping to restore normal function. Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that affects at least 1% of the population, women more so than men, but it's not something that we need to suffer from. As we begin to understand better how to utilize stem cells and with the background and knowledge and expertise that we have here in pelvic and reconstructive surgery, it really helps us to understand how best to apply these new treatments for your specific condition.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0," 4

But a Chicago Medical Center thinks a new form of acupuncture could very well be the hope that many women are looking for, a way to end chronic pelvic pain. Rachel fellers can now enjoy the ancient practice of yoga because a centuries-old treatment is allowing her to do it pain-free. I feel amazing. Rachel is at Loyola University Medical Center for an advanced type of acupuncture. After years of chronic pain in her abdomen, this is now allowing her to live a more normal life. It all started when she was 12 with terrible dehydration and vomiting. I also passed out in the middle church and had to be carried out. She tried everything, even traditional acupuncture, but nothing worked. But this acupuncture study involves placing the needles in a more concentrated way and includes heating the needles to target the most painful areas. If I put the needles in and the heat penetrates all the way into your booboo, how good would that feel? Rachel was blown away by the results. Thankfulness and gratitude that I wasn't trapped inside of my body anymore. Rachel's doctor says every patient in the study who's been getting the treatment and not the placebo has been coming back for follow-ups. Without me ever telling them what arm of the treatment you are getting, that's got to tell you something. For Rachel, the results include a night and day better relationship with her husband and her kids. Rachel's doctor says the only side effect is some occasional bruising. The results of the clinical trial will be published next year. Rachel wants people to know that this is symptom management, not a cure, but with ongoing treatment their quality of life can and will improve.",Pudendal Nerve,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0," 4
